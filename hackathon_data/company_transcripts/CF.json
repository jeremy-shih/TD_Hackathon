At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a remainder, today's conference maybe recorded.","It's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Dan Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Dan A. Aldridge - Director-Investor Relations","Good morning and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Aldridge, Director of Investor Relations, and with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development; and Chris Bohn, our Senior Vice President of Supply Chain.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its third quarter 2015 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide two of this webcast presentation and from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by acknowledging the outstanding effort of our people to keep themselves and each other safe. Our safety performance reflected in our reportable incident rate has continued to improve and, at the end of the third quarter, was a new all-time best rate of 0.80 incidents per 200,000 work-hours. Safety is a hallmark of operational excellence and something we focus on every day. It is a critical component of our implied license to operate and it is gratifying to see our team continue to improve our performance. This is notable in itself, but all the more remarkable, because in addition to our regular operations, we have thousands of extra people on our sites working to complete our capacity expansion projects, along with several scheduled plant turnarounds. I would like to thank all our employees and contractors for the focus and safety leadership they've demonstrated to contribute to this great result.","CF Industries reported EBITDA of $256 million for the third quarter and over $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2015. The third quarter is seasonally our slowest quarter of the year and this year in particular had a lot of noise running through the numbers. Looking a bit more deeply into our results, you will see that the EBITDA for the third quarter was remarkably similar to third quarter of 2014 after giving effect for certain distinct items. Most notably, unrealized mark-to-market losses on natural gas hedges, transaction costs related to the deals announced during the quarter, and gains from the remeasurement of GrowHow, along with a few other items.","As you can also see from the slide \u2013 from the data on slide 21, EBITDA for the first nine months of 2015 is largely unchanged from our nine-month results for 2014, after normalizing for the non-operating item noise in both periods.","I'll now turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, and then I will wrap-up with an update on our strategic initiatives. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Thanks, Tony. The global fertilizer market has continued to be very competitive and the supply of fertilizer has been heavily impacted by new exportable global production and lower ocean freight rates. During 2015 and through the third quarter, the devaluation of multiple currencies only exacerbated this situation. Chinese government devalued their currency during the third quarter. This devaluation, along with less expensive coal and ocean freight, help to push the international price of urea lower.","However, over the last few months, China has been reducing its exports. This decline has also been evidenced in the last three India urea tenders, which saw lower Chinese producer participation. Additionally, over the last few weeks, several large curtailments of urea facilities have been reported in China.","The weak ruble continues to give incentive to Russia nitrogen producers to export rather than to supply domestic Russian demand. Prices are higher outside of Russia, and payment in dollars is more advantageous than in rubles. The Brazilian real also continued its decline during the quarter and has had a negative impact on the urea market, where Brazilian imports are down nearly 38% year-over-year.","In North America, the third quarter is traditionally a lower demand quarter as farmers focus on the fall harvest and manufacturers build their inventories in anticipation of the fall ammonia application and spring fertilizer seasons, this year was no exception.","While all these factors have led to a depressed pricing environment, we believe pricing is beginning to stabilize and that we have reached the seasonal floor of anthracite coal-based production in China at around $250 a ton delivered to the U.S. Gulf.","Sales volume for the third quarter was 3.2 million tons. Production volume was heavily impacted by the turnaround and refurbishment at our facility in Woodward, Oklahoma. The facility was offline for 75 days during the quarter, impacting year-over-year production by approximately 200,000 tons combined of UAN, ammonia and DEF.","We entered the third quarter with adequate levels of ammonia inventory after a very robust first six month shipment pace. The new Donaldsonville urea plant was expected to start production in the third quarter, and, therefore, consume most of the excess ammonia inventory position. However, the urea plant will come on later than expected.","Coupled with the previously scheduled downtime of upgrading capacity to Donaldsonville, these drove higher levels of net ammonia than usual and we made the decision to sell spot ammonia into lower-priced export markets.","During the third quarter, we completed the successful UAN fill program that was launched late in the second quarter. We were able to book over 3 million tons for the campaign at healthy netbacks. Ammonium nitrate continued the trend of lower demand that began in 2014. The third quarter is normally a slow demand period for AN in North America, and 2015 is proven to be especially challenged.","However, we were able to maintain an adequate ammonium nitrate production rate in the Yazoo City by utilizing the export channel. In the United Kingdom, AN is also experiencing slow demand, but is more of a seasonal issue and we expect there to be good agricultural demand going forward. We're optimistic about the future of North American AN given our supply agreement with Orica that will be starting in 2017, as well as continued growth in the United Kingdom.","The fundamental demand characteristics for nitrogen are strong. In North America, nitrogen fertilizer demand is expected to be slightly higher in 2016 with about 15.7 million tons of consumption. The harvest is progressing, ammonia applications have begun, and the current returns for the 2016 crop based on new crop futures favor corn plantings. As a result, CF now expects 2016 plantings to be 90.5 million acres, which is 2.1 million acres higher than the current year.","We have an appropriate level of inventory of product that we believe is well positioned to support our customers' needs for the fall ammonia application and spring season. Along with stabilizing prices and lower imports, this could lead to better than expected pricing for the fourth quarter. We expect to be well positioned to sell all that we can produce.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bert. Beginning this quarter, we have changed our segment reporting, moving from four segments; ammonia, urea, UAN, and Other to five. Ammonium nitrate will now be reported as its own segment. Prior to this change, ammonium nitrate was part of the Other segment. This is as a result of its greater role in our portfolio with the addition of the former GrowHow assets in the United Kingdom.","In the third quarter, we generated $256 million of EBITDA on sales of $927 million. This compares to $338 million of EBITDA on sales of $921 million in the third quarter of 2014. As Tony discussed, EBITDA results were lower than the prior year period due to a few distinct items. First, our cost of goods sold was affected by an unrealized mark-to-market loss on our natural gas hedges of $126 million. Second, we incurred $37 million in costs associated with our acquisitions. Third, we had approximately $15 million in costs related to the expansions of our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities. And finally, these were partially offset by a gain of $94 million related to the remeasurement of our investment in GrowHow.","During the quarter, we also recorded approximately $30 million in other expenses for certain items. These items included $17 million in fixed cost absorption related to the turnaround and refurbishment at our Woodward, Oklahoma facility. There were also approximately $6 million in costs related to the financing of the OCI deal.","The expansion projects are progressing well at both Donaldsonville and Port Neal. We announced an increase in the projected capital costs of roughly 10% versus our previous estimate of $4.2 billion. The main factors driving the estimate up are the finalization of engineering drawings later than we anticipated and the productivity of our contractors. As engineering has been completed, we have found that the actual construction quantities required to complete the projects exceeded earlier estimates provided by the engineering contractor. Increases in quantities result in more labor hours required to complete the job. And because we have placed a priority on schedule, that also means more craftsmen, more extended shifts, and lower productivity than originally expected.","However, we now have virtually all of the engineering work completed, so the uncertainty going forward at least with respect to quantities of materials has been significantly reduced. Weather and labor productivity will continue to be variables in the equation, but we are beginning to see the finish lines, particularly at Donaldsonville.","Including the estimated cost increase, the projects are still expected to generate after-tax returns in the mid-teens, which is well above our cost of capital. This is because our initial financial forecast assumed a forward gas strip much higher than the gas strip available today. Additionally, when we did the original project economics, we used a conservative nitrogen price forecast for the first several years of project operation.","For the full year 2015, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $2.6 billion. This consists of approximately $2 billion for the capacity expansion projects and approximately $600 million of sustaining and other capital expenditures.","In the third quarter, the company repurchased 358,000 shares for approximately $22.5 million, bringing shares outstanding down to 233 million as of September 30, 2015. Including shares repurchased during the first two quarters, this brings the company's year-to-date share repurchases to 8.9 million shares, for approximately $527 million. During the quarter, we completed a $1 billion private placement of senior notes. We intend to use the proceeds to fund our capital expenditure programs and for general corporate purposes.","In the third quarter of 2015, the average realized cost of natural gas purchased by the company for North American operations was $2.77 per MMBtu, a 37% decline year-over-year. The average realized cost of gas purchased by the company in the United Kingdom in the third quarter was $6.43 per MMBtu and gas in the United Kingdom continues to trend downward as the effects of lower oil prices filter into liquefied natural gas prices and long-term gas contracts indexed to oil. The overall average realized cost of natural gas purchased by the company in the third quarter was $3.07 per MMBtu.","During the third quarter of 2015 we did not enter into any additional hedges for the balance of 2015, but added to existing hedges for 2016 and 2017 in addition to initiating hedges for 2018. These hedges and the fixed basis differentials we have in place for our Port Neal and Courtright complexes have taken significant amount of cost risk off the table. For additional detail on the company's natural gas hedges, please refer to the natural gas table in the appendix of the earnings release.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dennis. Our performance financially has been very solid in 2015, particularly so given the significant headwinds we have faced; a challenging global market where abundant supply has pressured product prices, currency exchange rate moves that have either helped some foreign producers become more cost competitive or made it more challenging for some importing countries to buy product, and concerns over the commodity sector in general. Even in the face of these difficulties, our results for the quarter and the first nine months of 2015 were essentially unchanged from our 2014 results after normalizing for a few non-operational items. This continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model and the enduring advantage we have from plentiful low-cost North American natural gas.","If you refer to slide 11, you will see a table that shows various EBITDA outputs for the standalone CF business after our capacity expansion projects come online, as a function of our realized cost of natural gas and our average realized selling price of nitrogen products on urea equivalent basis. You can clearly see that we remain highly profitable over a very wide range of market conditions.","On a trailing 12 month basis, our average realized gas cost was $3.07 per MMBtu and average realized urea equivalent price was $343 a ton. What this shows is even with the challenging market conditions over the past 12 months, this business is very profitable and generates a significant amount of the EBITDA.","Regardless of all the noise going on around us and the fears in the market, those who take more than just a cursory look at our performance will recognize the following in controvertible fact. Our business continues to run well and we continue to deliver the EBITDA.","I would now like to pivot from the quarter and speak about the bright future ahead of CF Industries. Over the last few months, we have announced several strategic moves, which will deliver significant growth in our cash generating ability. The completion of the capacity expansion projects along with the three major transactions we've announced is expected to increase the production capacity of CF 65% by the end of 2017. All of these initiatives have very attractive individual return profiles with unlevered after-tax returns well above our cost of capital.","And when taken as a group, these initiatives are unmatched in our industry and represent an opportunity for significant near-term shareholder value creation. On Tuesday, we announced that the OCI deal has cleared U.S. antitrust review process. This is a major step forward in closing this deal. And upon completion, this transaction will give us the premier global footprint in the nitrogen fertilizer industry and allow us to fully leverage our global assets.","We continue to expect that we will close the OCI transaction in Q2 2016. Our transactions with CHS are groundbreaking and should be highly accretive to our shareholders. The product supply agreement provides us ratable off-take from a premier agricultural cooperative with which we have had a longstanding and productive relationship.","The deal provides CHS with up to 1.1 million tons of urea and 580,000 tons of UAN at market prices. CHS has $2.8 billion equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC, provides them an opportunity for achieving manufacturing economics via dividends, and has validated the strength of our business model and the value it can create.","In essence, a highly knowledgeable market participant values the standalone CF Industries business at an effective enterprise value of over $30 billion, even before giving effect to the OCI transaction.","On the capacity expansion front, we are pleased to announce that the granular urea plant at Donaldsonville is now mechanically complete and in the process of being commissioned. We will make an announcement when the plant has achieved stable production performance.","The Donaldsonville UAN plant is on track to start up in the fourth quarter of this year, and the ammonia plant to follow in early 2016. Port Neal is also progressing well, and we continue to target a startup in mid 2016.","Finally, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in GrowHow which has made CF the largest nitrogen fertilizer producer in the United Kingdom. These operations are well positioned in an import-dependent region, and we are delighted that they are now fully part of the CF organization.","Taken together, these initiatives represent significant opportunities for our company and our shareholders. Before I close, I want to reiterate that our philosophy and approach to capital allocation remains unchanged from what we have said and done in the past.","As you can see on slide 12, we expect that over the period from 2016 to 2019, we will generate significant excess cash that is unallocated. Our first call on that capital remains investment back into the business, when we can find projects within our strategic fairway that have a risk adjusted rate of return well above our cost of capital. Beyond that, excess capital belongs to and will be returned to our shareholders just like we have done consistently in the past.","I would like to thank our entire team for getting us to this point. Many people have worked tirelessly over the preceding weeks and months to move our initiatives forward. We have a very bright future ahead of us, and we are just at the beginning of the journey.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And it looks like our first question in queue will come from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much, and good morning.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Your realized ammonia price during the quarter was still slightly lower than many expected, including us. Could you just quickly comment on any differences in selling patterns here that affected your netbacks? And also, if you expected benefit at all from the recent increases in the Midwest ammonia prices?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bert?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Hey, good morning. This is Bert. And thanks for the question. You're exactly right, ammonia price was lower. When you look at ammonia in the third quarter, it is a non-agricultural application ammonia quarter. We had a little bit that might bleed in from Q2 just for some side-dress, but it's predominantly an industrial quarter. And that was reflected in our result. When you look at the \u2013 what drives many of our industrial contracts that would be Tampa-based pricing, which was $460 in July and August and then $445 in September. So, for an average, let's say, of in the $450s. Taken to a short ton, that gets you pretty close to $400, and that reflects a lot of what was driving our numbers as well as gas-based contracts when you have gas in the $220 to $270 range during the quarter, that drove the pricing realization lower.","Now, we've exported \u2013 as we mentioned in our comments, exported or sold into the spot market around 18% to 20% of our volume and that came at those numbers. And so, when you roll that up, we're in line with what the international markets were, actually higher, but lower, I think, what you all expected.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. And just a quick \u2013 a very quick follow up on \u2013 in addition to some of the increased costs you incurred during the quarter, it still looks like some costs \u2013 on some line items were still fairly bloated in addition to the downtime at our Woodward. Is there any comment on how we should be thinking about your margin per ton production going forward and any additional color \u2013 was there anything else that was non-recurring in the third quarter that we should be parsing out?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Chris, remember that unrealized mark-to-market losses on the gas hedge positions rolled through those numbers. So, there is almost $130 million of kind of non-operational, non-recurring cost that show up in those numbers. That's one thing you have to back out.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And there is \u2013 yeah, we also had $17 million of fixed cost absorption that's rolled through as well, Chris, during the quarter. So \u2013 but just step back from it, Chris, our plants run with the same efficiency they've always run, gas costs, what it costs, and our gas price profile is very good, and the overheads and stuff associated with the plants are not really any different today than they were before. So, no, there hasn't been margin deterioration.","If you look at SG&A, it's up a little bit in the quarter, but it's about exactly the same for the year, and that just reflects the addition of \u2013 largely just the addition of the GrowHow assets on a consolidated basis during the quarter. And then the other operating net line you see that that moves up and down, but that's mostly just forex moments for the most part, and then costs associated or expense items associated with the expansion projects. So, no, there is really nothing in there a much of a story.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next phone question in queue will come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your questions please.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Could you just \u2013 I just want to sort of clarify the return calculation on the new projects. You mentioned that, obviously, gas prices are lower than probably the last time, you stated what the return profile was. But I also kind of remember back from the July 2013 Analyst Day that in that return calculation, you're assuming some improvement in urea prices down the road as you thought that Chinese cost curve is going to go up. So could you just help us reconcile what gas price you're assuming now versus before, and maybe what sort of break-even into the Gulf you're assuming now versus before?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Vincent, let me kind of step back and talk about where we sat in 2012 when we made the decision to move forward with these projects. At the time, the forward curve was above $5.50 per MMBtu and that dramatically changes what the profitability of the output of these plants are. We did anticipate at that time based on the number of projects that had been announced and were in flight in Middle East, North Africa, as well as in China that kind of 2016 was going to be sort of a low point in the pricing curve.","And so, we had put forward, as Dennis mentioned in his comments, a pretty conservative view of where nitrogen was going to trade over the coming years before it started kind of recovering at the back-end of 2017 and into 2018. And so, nothing really that's happened in the marketplaces is all that dramatic other than the fact that, overall, the global cost inputs for all hydrocarbons have shifted down, but if you look at kind of the effective impact on the margin that we're realizing, it is not that dramatically different. And, as such, there has been a little bit of deterioration particularly in Port Neal, because that's where the brunt of the cost increases have occurred, but the Donaldsonville project is still pretty darn close to where we had made the original calculations for a return on that. And, so as a result, both projects end up kind of solidly in the mid-teens return.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. Can I just ask you separately, post this whole thing with Volkswagen, does anything change about the diesel exhaust fluid opportunity set over time?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Actually, it's going to be positive. We're still following that and we just participated in the energy conference here in Chicago and what the implications mechanically will be for these engines that are out, already in the market that will be recalled, and then for changes to the existing structure of the power unit going forward. So, we do see that as a positive step for DEF. DEF continues to grow in the 30% to 40% range per year. We're actively participating, actively growing \u2013 actively growing our production, as we already announced for Courtright and Donaldsonville. And, that's a very positive light for us going forward.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next phone question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Can you quantify how much ammonia and UAN you sold forward and how are those pricing outlook compared to current spot prices?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Good morning. So, for \u2013 we don't really give exact numbers, although I did say 3 million tons was done in the second quarter and into the third quarter for the UAN fill program. The fill program is at the end of the season and then that pushes us through generally November, December. We've continued to take sales after the fill program. So, we have a very healthy order book for the UAN, for our UAN position going forward, and are continuing to participate in the domestic as well as the international market.","As you can see from our price realization at $241 relative to today's NOLA prices that are published in the publications, we think that's an incredibly positive position, and we're going to continue to build on that.","For ammonia, the fall season is just starting; we had a pretty good day yesterday with shipments out, but we're adherents and advocates for the 4R program that the TFI and other industry participants are advocating to farmers. And the crux of that is applying ammonia when the ground temperature is 50 degrees; and today, as we sit in sunny Deerfield, it's close to be 70 degrees. So, we look at the ammonia season as being delayed, but we've got a lot of product sold forward and ready to be applied in November.","If you look at the 30-day forecast, which we tend to follow probably every hour these days, you've got positive temperatures in the 50s during the day time into the first week of December. So, we think we've got a lot of runway still to go, and product is positioned. And I think this really gives the advantage to CF. Because of our terminal system, we're able to supply, and we fully supply when that condensed time does take place. And I think this year it could be a week to 10 days that the majority of our ammonia goes out. So we're prepared and price realization, we think, will be positive.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other benefit, Steve, is it looks like the crop is coming off the fields in about the normal timeframe, are in fact largely off. And so, there looks like a pretty good runway here in front of us for a really strong application season in the fall, given the mild temperature. So we're really pleased with where we're positioned.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if we can roll forward a year in anticipation of the OCI deal closing, what fraction of Donaldsonville production do you think you might be in a position to export with higher netbacks? And how might that vary seasonally and by what product?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Steve, I think as we sit here today, based on the dock configuration, we're able to export approximately 50% of the D'ville production. We have enough dock space down there where if that looks like something that we want to increase for a, not that dramatic cost, we can dredge the channel a little bit, do some infrastructure improvements and increase our export capacity. So we've got a fair bit of flexibility in terms of export capability there.","I would say, initially we're going to kind of continue to ramp-up versus where we are, but a lot of it just has to do with what is the net kind of \u2013 we're not really thinking about it from a netback margin perspective anymore, we're thinking about it from a netback after-tax cash flow perspective. And what we're going to be maximizing is a little bit of a different calculus than what we've done in the past, which was focused on EBITDA and margin. We're going to look at what's the best possible after-tax cash position. And that might, on the margin, lead us to tapping into international opportunities, if they look attractive. But it's really going to be an at-the-moment decision based on the different global market conditions and where we can maximize our cash returns.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next in line is Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Bert, I wanted to ask you about your urea outlook. You commented that you think prices have bottomed here and perhaps stabilizing. A year ago, we're at $312, now we're at about $245, $250 NOLA urea. You hit the trough earlier. Do you see a bounce quicker? I mean, last year we didn't get much of a bounce till early April. So just wondering what kind of \u2013 I mean, are you seeing enough attractive forward sale opportunities in urea to put together a decent forward book there?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So, right now, you're right, NOLA has been hovering in the $240s, $250s; we've been realizing a different range of price structure based on where we're selling and how we're selling. But I do see some positive things coming, as I mentioned in my comments, with the situation today in China. We expect profitability or lack thereof is for the marginal producer, the anthracite coal producer.","But when you look around the globe, we do believe there is sufficient supply available and the cost curve has moved a little bit lower, so we may be stabilizing in that $250 to $285. But I do expect to see some spikes because there is \u2013 as we can see from the inventory chain, not a lot of inventory is being built in North America as well as in Europe. And we expect demand to be continued to be strong in India. So there are some good demand points. I don't see Brazil coming back this year. I think, as we said, 38% down year-over-year. I think that we're entering their higher demand season, October, November, December, January for the second crop corn. So, I would say, we'll stay in a range \u2013 a little bit range bound this year due to capacity. And then, as Tony mentioned, we're fairly positive going forward in the out-years on what can take place.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you. And then shifting to a different subject. On your gas hedging strategy, basically 100% of your needs are locked in for 2016. Is that the philosophy now to lock in all your needs or do you ever want to have some exposure to take advantage of the potential dip in pricing?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Don, we haven't really changed our philosophy at all in terms of the forward hedge. As we sat earlier in 2015, we look forward and we could lock most of 2016 at basically $3 flat, and we've been historically criticized for being too slow to lock in gas because people have said it takes risk off the table.","When we saw a forward price at $3 for the year, we thought this actually makes a fair bit of sense and we didn't do it all at once, we kind of stepped our way into it over a couple of different tranches. But over the long run, we think $3 is a pretty darn good cost, and generally speaking if you're drilling in dry gas fields we think that's still below the replacement cost of new production and maybe lower than that or substantially lower than that in some of the wet plays, but in a dry gas area. So that was part of the rationale as we thought about locking that position is.","As we look forward, we think the 2017 and 2018 curve is under pressure a little bit by where the current storage position is in the U.S. and we would expect demand to continue to increase. So while the positions we're sitting in 2017 and 2018 are underwater relative to where the market is trading today. I don't think they were bad decisions to enter into in hindsight.","The other thing I want to point out is, we have not hedged the gas associated with the OCI production. So, between the Beaumont facility and the Wever facility, there is a fair bit of increased gas consumption that we have in North America and that remains completely unhedged and in 2016, 2017, and 2018 as well.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next in queue comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Just following on that, I don't know if you're hedged for any gas in GrowHow UK. Can you maybe talk about that and what your strategy for that would be going forward? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Joel. Yeah, we currently have not hedged gas in the UK, it is something we are spending a fair bit of time looking at and evaluating and, similarly, we haven't done any kind of forward hedges for the gas that we're going to be needing at Geleen in the Netherlands as well.","Gas currently in the UK is trading sort of in and around $6 and it's kind of up to $6.50 on the forward, it's relatively flat. So, as we look at that, it's attractive relative to historical, there is good margin to be had at that sort of gas price. And it's something we're looking at, but we haven't jumped into that so far.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. And just following up on something I think Bert was talking about, so, I mean, the big thing this year has been that NOLA urea is really not trading at any premium to China. Can you really talk about why that is this year? And as the expansions come on in the U.S., when you talk about the $250 to $285, I mean is your view that's the trading range for urea over the next year as opposed to sort of a floor level? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah, it's an interesting conundrum as we look and watch these markets develop. I think you're just seeing, we're in a time of change and a lot of product has come on and more product will be coming on, and we have to find a balance in the markets. There are times when NOLA has traded below international parity, and obviously we watched that with interest. And when it's above, we want to participate at a greater share. And so, there are some tactical moves we'd like to make internally with where we position product, where we sell and how we sell.","But I think, today with \u2013 and you look at the paper market and you look at what the forward markets are offering, we seem to be range bound at least through 2015 and I think some of the other changes will come as a result of inventory decisions, buying decisions. But I do see, like I said earlier, some positive points moving forward with demand coming out of \u2013 I think increased demand coming out of India. I hope in 2016, we see return to Brazil that plant that's in (38:32) not be operating for years. So the 5 million tons of demand out of Brazil will probably be there and a return to some other markets. And I don't think that Chinese anthracite coal producer can continue at their current rate of production and we're seeing that reflected in operating rates in China.","And so, when you look at the 13.6 million tons exported last year, estimating 12 million tons this year, I expect that to slowly wind-down to probably an acceptable rate in the 5 million to 10 million tons longer term, which sets up available options for CF.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other point, Joel, that I'd like to bring up is, as you sort of rewind the clock, you can look forward and see there was this ongoing tail of new plants that were coming online in China and Middle East, North Africa. That sort of tail, by the time we get to the middle of next year, is largely empty from there going forward. The U.S. plants will be online. Most of the Chinese plants will be completed and operating. So there has been this pretty significant build that's left this overhang of capacity and the marginal stuff swings on and off depending upon where price is. And, as you say, it sort of puts a relative cap on where prices get to before the marginal producer swings back into production again.","The global nitrogen demand is growing about 2% per year and that requires four to five world-scale ammonia complexes being brought on every year just to meet what the demand is. And so, as we look forward and the existing capacity gets absorbed into the marketplace, any kind of rebound in the Chinese economy with attendant increase in coal prices there, all of a sudden makes this marketplace shift into a different dynamic from a really over-heavily supplied position to one where there is some price appreciation. So, we think this is kind of the tough area to get through, but even at these ranges we're highly, highly profitable. And as we get into a recovery mode, we'll participate in that very, very nicely.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next in queue is Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your questions please.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a question on the ammonia market, want to get your thoughts on what would happen as you get into early 2016 if Iranian sanctions are lifted, and you start to see some more Iranian ammonia onto world markets? And maybe on a related topic, how are you thinking about availability from the Black Sea and Trinidad over the next 6 months to 12 months? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah. When you look at, that is an issue we're following when the sanctions are lifted. We have already seen exports out of Iran increased by, I think, 1 million tons and that could possibly be a further 1 million tons of urea and not necessarily ammonia. There are discussions we know with some Indian producers to look at possibly putting up a new plant at probably three years to four years down the road, but Iran sits on a lot of gas and then it makes sense for them to monetize that gas and they will be a competitive producer and participant. But I think the ammonia would stay more in the Asia marketplace, and \u2013 because that push back Black Sea product or Ukrainian production, not much of that is going there today.","And so, looking at your \u2013 the second part of your question, what happens to Black Sea and Ukrainian production, a lot of that's going to depends on what goes forward with some of the geopolitical issues there. But I do think that gets backed out, and I think Trinidadian supply continues to move into Florida, into Europe, and maybe even into South America with some of the movements that are taking place today. Ammonia as well, it's \u2013 we've hit a low point in the market where Tampa is positioned today. And so, we're continuing to watch that and participate and use the benefit of our terminalling system enable to store product, move product, and participate at a greater degree of the agricultural markets in Q4 and Q2 of next year.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Adam, as we look at Trinidad going forward, we continue to think that gas is going to be in the neighborhood of 10% to 15% curtailments into point leases like it's been over the last year or so. And we don't really see any kind of catalyst for additional production coming online in Trinidad. Given how low ammonia price is and most of those gas contracts are and product linked that the net realized price to NGC and back to the gas producers is lower than the incremental cost of bringing on new production there. So, there is not a catalyst to bring on new production, we think those plants are going to continue to run well below what their rate is capable of running, and that certainly helps from the standpoint of an overall S&D balance.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And maybe on a related point. Do you think that as the new capacity in the U.S gets built out as Mosaic starts to source a meaningful increment of their ammonia needs from you guys as opposed to Tampa or the Black Sea that the U.S Gulf has to reflect freight from the Ukraine longer term?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","I think there are a lot of things driving. That was also a point to change for the industry. Tampa has always been a price setting mechanism for this hemisphere, and you're right, there will be changes, we have almost 1 million ton supply with \u2013 combined with our Trinidadian contract for Mosaic. But you have to remember that OCP is also increasing production with their diammonium phosphate, monoammonium phosphate production. So a lot of that ammonia can be sourced from either Ukraine or shooting over from Trinidad, and there have been some of our colleagues in the industry have already signed some contracts for that ammonia supply.","So I think it longer term, yes, when our contract starts in 2017 and actually some of our other contracts that position CF well being Orica, and CHS, we think that all those are part of our strategy to position ourselves in what we think is going to be a good market for CF in all the four products.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll pass it along. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next up is Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. When you allocate your mark-to-market losses for gas hedges across your segments, does one segment or another segment get disproportionately affected or how does one think about distributing the mark-to-market losses across the segments?","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The way we look at that, Jeff, just I think a good way to think about it is it's basically \u2013 if you think about it around $40 a ton. So for this quarter if you think about the mark-to-market that is embedded in the cost of goods sold for each of the segments, it varies by segment. But if you look at it across the whole business, it's about $40 per ton and it's going to be based effectively on \u2013 if you look at the gas content in each of the products.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, most of that goes into ammonia and then as ammonia rolls into the upgrade, it carries that additional cost with it. So, as Dennis said, it really goes as a function of the nutrient content or the end content in each of the products. So ammonia is going to carry the biggest proportion of that on a per ton basis, and then it's going to work its way down.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, I think Bert was commenting at the beginning of the call that maintenance capital expenditures were around $600 million. And I thought that previously you had spoken of maintenance CapEx as $500 million. Is there a reason why there has been an alteration or these are just round numbers?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, generally speaking, the system that we have today runs on a sustaining CapEx; this is kind of just keep-the-lights-on basis of about $350 million a year.","And what we spend about above that, generally speaking, are things that are improvements. So, we're putting about $60 million into the Yazoo City facility in order to be able to convert Ag AN production into industrial grade in order to serve the Orica contract and make sure that we've got that plant fully loaded going forward.","We're doing some DEF expansion projects in Courtright and in Donaldsonville, so that we can add capacity for DEF. We're doing some DCS implementations to improve our control environment and safety in a number of our facilities. Those things are on top of it. So as you look \u2013 and by the way, a lot of those projects have pretty significant positive return profiles associated with it. So, the $600 million that we're spending next year is kind of all of that stuff bundled together outside of the capacity expansion stuff, of which, kind of $350 million is keep-the-lights-on; the rest of it has a pretty good return profile to it.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next up is Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Just wanted to discuss a little bit about sort of your thoughts on the demand by region, particularly for this fall. I understand the Midwest volumes are probably going to be good with the weather windows. But maybe if you could talk about the Delta, the Southwest and some of the other areas where they've had a little bit more weather issues?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","When you look at the by-region, generally the Q4 application season is ammonia-focused and we start in Canada and then move south as the weather cooperates. And we've had an adequate season in Canada out of our three terminals as well as our plants, moving that product to the ground.","I'd expect \u2013 like I said earlier, we've had a pretty good day yesterday, but we're still not at full shipping rates out of the terminals. And so, you'll start seeing the Dakotas and Iowa and Nebraska, places like that, kicking off here shortly. And then, the Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas region already had part of their ammonia season go in Q3, which was focused on wheat pre-plant, and so that's more of a July, August, September application. And as we mentioned our Woodward plant was down, so we were unable to participate in a lot of that shipment season.","In Texas and for some of the corn acres, they've had a lot of good moisture and we're pretty pleased to see with some of the rains that have come through. That's also good for the Midwest, which allows ammonia to set, and so with a good moisture profile in the soil, that allows your applications to move forward. In the Delta, I can't really comment too much in that region, we're getting ready for ammonium nitrate in the Southeast, in the Delta region. Other than that, that's pretty much all I can comment.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Terrific.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","And then we'll look to Q1 and Q2.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","All right. Terrific. And then, if we do end up having a bigger ammonia run as you guys sort of anticipate nationwide, how does that impact your thinking on what UAN volumes might look like in the first half of next year. Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah. When you look at ammonia over time, it's fairly consistent. We're projecting 4.7 million tons. It has been a little over 5 million tons in years past when we were \u2013 and we had some higher acres numbers. But we see acres recovering into the 90 million range \u2013 90 million, 91 million. And so, I think with the pricing structure that's available to a farmer and through the retail system, it's pretty attractive to apply ammonia. But we have to think of all the three major products in conjunction, or in \u2013 together on an end value. And so you can't get too distanced from what ammonia is for urea and UAN. And we're mindful of that and we're keeping our pricing in line with historical averages. So, we're fairly positive on UAN demand and what will take place for Q1 and Q2.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question in queue comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Dan Jester on for P.J. Given the comments today about a bit more inflation in your project costs as you get closer to the finish line, has OCI informed you of any cost increase or delays to their project in Iowa or the methanol plant in Texas, and if so, who would be responsible for addressing those higher costs?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Dan, so the contract that we have with OCI, puts an absolute dollar limit cap on the amount of cost that kind of gets transfer to us from the completion, actually both of those facilities. So, we know what the ceiling is in both cases and at least with respect to Wever, my understanding is OCI has a fixed dollar cap limit for the construction piece with the construction company that they're using.","So it really, at this point, is kind of on the contractors' nickel once they \u2013 there is a little of cushion in there that once they're through that cushion, it's all on the contractors' nickel. So, we're kind of $1 certain in terms of at least the top end of the cost, if it comes in lower than that, it will be a favorable surprise to us. But we're anticipating and modeling and assuming that we're going to bear the ceiling on those costs on those projects.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then, I think we've touched on it a couple of times in the call already, but I just want to clarify is the 12 million tons of Chinese exports that you were thinking about this year for urea, is that a good run rate to think about going into 2016 or is there a possibility that that could come down again? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, when you look at China, every year is an anomaly. When you see the numbers ramp-up from zero tons, 2 million tons, 4 million tons, 8 million tons, 13 million tons, and so, we're modeling this year coming down to 12 million tons. I think based on \u2013 again, cost structure market optionality and how we see the market developing, I think, that's a declining run rate. But I'm not comfortable giving you a specific number.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And it looks like our next question will come from the line of Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","So, in the prepared remarks, I think, you mentioned OCI's close expectation is a mid-2016. Is that any different from prior expectations? And can you just talk about what needs to be done after that \u2013 for that transaction to be close? And when the transaction closes, does that mean you can start doing the repurchases right away?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Andrew, so the \u2013 we've got antitrust clearance now in the U.S. We filed our final filing for European antitrust clearance, and so, really the kind of the long pole in the tent on this whole process revolves around kind of the SEC process from getting the S-4 offering document through the SEC review period \u2013 process and having an effective document that we can send to shareholders.","As soon as that goes to shareholders as effective, we can post our annual meeting date, or our special meeting date, we'll have the meeting for the vote on both the OCI and the CF side, and then according to Dutch Law, there is a 60-day wait period following the approval of the shareholders for a reduction in capital in the OCI business that gives their creditors a chance to be notified appropriately.","So, it's really kind of the wait period between noticing the annual \u2013 of the shareholder meeting, having a shareholder meeting and then the 60-day creditor notice that pushes us how we think likely into kind of the Q2 time horizon. Part of that depends upon how quickly we can get through the SEC review period on the S-4. But we're certainly working very diligently on trying to expedite that process as much as possible. And then once we're closed as long as we're not in the dark window or the blackout window around a quarter between sort of the quarter closing and announcing results that type of thing. The window is open and we'll be able to go ahead and initiate share repurchases at that point.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's great. And then just switching gears a little bit over to Woodward. I think in the past you've done a really good job minimizing the disruptions from just normal plant turnarounds, but impact from Woodward seemed to be a little bit more material than expected. Was the turnaround longer than anticipated? And going forward, can we expect any sort of guidance around some sort of \u2013 the extended maintenance more than the usual type stuff? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on Woodward this year, it was a pretty major turnaround. This was really the first opportunity that we've had to go in and kind of convert the plant over to the CF's standards for doing things. So we implemented a full DCS system in the Woodward plant. We did a complete re-harp of the reformer, and then there was just a fair bit of found work from things that \u2013 in the preceding period before we owned the plant had not really kind of been kept up to our standards.","And so, as a result of the found work, it did extend a little longer than what was originally planned and the costs were a bit higher that led to then the fixed cost absorption that we had to go through. But our focus is to make sure the plants are safe, make sure we can get high on-stream and reliability out of them, and we feel very good about the state of that plant now on a go-forward basis, so that we'll be able to run it hard.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","And any potential for guidance going forward on a sort of like extended turnarounds?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We, generally speaking, don't provide a lot of turnaround information, part of that is because we've managed very carefully kind of what our inventory position is and how we satisfy our customers' requirements and we don't think it necessarily helps to give all of our competitors that sort of detail around how to plan for what our production looks like.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. No, that's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. And at this time, that does conclude our time for questions. I'd like to turn the program back over to Dan Aldridge for any additional or closing remarks.","Dan A. Aldridge - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Huey (59:21).

On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question and answer session related to the company's financial results for the quarter.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to the conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.

Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2017, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $303 million after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","The story of the quarter was exceptional execution by the CF team. Record production and sales volumes, outstanding safety, good price realizations and cost reductions against a backdrop of difficult market conditions.","The global market was impacted due to an excess amount of traded material. Low cost export-oriented production has increased, while at the same time other regions have also brought on new production, decreasing their import requirements like in North America. This has led to an excess of available tons and resulted in sloppiness in the market. Although we fully expect that some high cost producers will be forced to curtail or permanently shut capacity and for product flows to adjust, it will take time for the global trade flows to realign. We do see some encouraging signs that this is beginning to happen. As we have summarized on slide 13, however, there is still a ways to go.","China is supplying less nitrogen to the international market because global prices are below the cash cost of many Chinese producers. Urea exports from China this year through June totaled 2.8 million metric tons, a decline of 46% from the same period last year. In February, we projected that China would export between 5 million to 6 million metric tons of urea in 2017. With operating rates at approximately 60% of capacity, actual exports may in fact be below our estimate.","Exports are also down from other marginal producers in Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Ukraine. Based on public announcements, we estimate that more than 10 million metric tons of ammonia capacity and 8 million metric tons of urea capacity in these areas have been curtailed for extended periods over the last year.","Although we are seeing improvements like those, more is needed. In the quarter, certain producers and traders with excess tons needed to unload positions and find liquidity and unfortunately North America was the dumping ground. North America urea and UAN imports through May were down 22% and 10% year-over-year respectively. However, these levels were still substantially higher than what is required given new North American capacity. Consequently urea barge prices at New Orleans averaged $30 per ton below international parity during the quarter and broke through 2016 lows in June.","Even with NOLA barge prices so low, shipments continued to arrive in second quarter. It is clearly uneconomic to force more tons into North America than what is consumed here, driving prices below international parity only to have those same excess tons re-exported again later. Product movements like those are part of the trade flows that need to rebalance in order to eliminate obvious inefficiencies in the global system.","Looking forward, we project that nitrogen prices will be challenged through the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. Global energy prices remain low and still more production capacity is yet to come online. Despite modest urea price increases we have seen since the end of June, the third quarter typically has the lowest demand and prices of the year for all products as you can see on slide 16. If substantial imports arrive during the quarter could see pricing test new lows.","However, our longer-term outlook remains very positive and is well grounded in industry fundamentals. Post 2018 we project the rate of net new capacity additions will be well below expected global demand growth, which should help pull the industry out of the cyclical lows we are experiencing today and lead to sector recovery over the next few years.","Now I want to highlight some of our outstanding execution in the quarter. We ran our plants really well. We produced an all-time record 2.7 million tons of ammonia while doing it safely, achieving a 12 month recordable incident rate of 0.91 incidents per 200,000 hours worked. This is especially remarkable considering the number of new operating units and the number of new people we have added in the last two years.","The new Port Neal ammonia plant ran at more than 115% of nameplate capacity during the quarter and we had 10 other ammonia units that ran above 99% of their stated capacity. This was truly a system-wide accomplishment.","Our sales and logistics team took that record production and turned it into record sales volumes. They did a great job of navigating challenging conditions and moving tons to the right place at the right time. In some cases the right place was offshore. During the quarter we use the destination optionality we've created to export nearly 100,000 tons of urea from Donaldsonville. These exports averaged more than $10 per ton higher than prevailing NOLA urea barge prices at the time.","We also took advantage of export opportunities for more than 200,000 tons of ammonia and 300,000 tons of UAN. As a result, we proactively managed our system inventory, kept our plants running full and realized good overall cash margins for the business.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk more about the commercial environment during the quarter and looking forward. Then Dennis will discuss our financial position. Additionally, we're going to try something a bit new for us here at CF, Dennis is going to highlight some key market data points and provide some handrails for people trying to model our third-quarter performance in an attempt to help them calculate a more accurate result. So I encourage you to listen to what Dennis has to say.","Okay, with that I will now turn the call over to Bert.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. CF's performance in the second quarter demonstrated the strength and agility of our team and system. We employed our storage assets, shifted our product mix as needed and sent product to twice as many countries as he did in the second quarter of 2016. As a result, we set company production and sales volume records and maximized the overall margin available to us despite the challenging business conditions.","New capacity and low energy costs worldwide continue to pressure nitrogen prices. As Tony said, the market is in transition and global trade flows are adjusting. We expect that this process and its effect on pricing will continue through the remainder of 2017 and into 2018. Low nitrogen prices are affecting most of our segments, but we saw localized factors play a role in our performance as well during the second quarter. Wet and cold weather in North America that lasted from mid-March through April disrupted the spring application season for ammonia, urea and UAN.","For ammonia, this resulted in lower application totals as some demand moved to upgraded products. We moved the balance of ammonia we had expected to sell to agricultural customers, as well as the incremental tons produced from our expanded capacity into the export channel. Export sales were higher than expected as a result and lowered our average sales price for ammonia during the quarter. We expect our ammonia exports to decline significantly by the end of the year when Mosaic's vessel is ready and they begin taking ammonia delivery from our Donaldsonville facility according to our supply agreement.","Turning to urea, high imports in the first quarter led to a price reset at NOLA that was more pronounced and earlier than expected. The urea barge price at NOLA fell 38% from the Q1 high to the low of Q2, as weather slowed demand and distribution channels in North America already had sufficient inventory. With the NOLA barge price $30 below international parity, we were able to take advantage of export opportunities at a premium to NOLA barge prices as Tony mentioned earlier. We believe the price disparity between NOLA and the rest of the world is not sustainable and that urea pricing will converge as trade flows adjust.","While we produced record levels of ammonia and urea this quarter, we made less UAN than the same period the year before as we adjusted our product mix to reflect better opportunities with other products. The wet and cold weather led to late planting and slower growing conditions, delaying UAN purchases and applications in North America. We were able to use our storage assets to capture the resulting late season demand that stretched into July. We've seen continued volume momentum with UAN as we launched our fill program last week at the equivalent of $125 per short ton at NOLA, or about $15 to $20 less per ton than last year, depending on location.","Ammonium nitrate continues to be a bright spot for volumes and pricing due to a long-term supply agreement that commenced in 2017 and additional AN volume produced and sold in the UK.","We continue to grow our sales of diesel exhaust fluid. We expect DEF sales in North America to exceed those in Europe for the first time ever this year. Our new DEF unit in Donaldsonville gives us additional capacity to meet this growing demand and additional product mix flexibility to adjust quickly to changing nitrogen market conditions. We expect the global nitrogen market environment to remain challenging. We are in the midst of the quarter where we typically see our lowest prices and sell the least volume. There is additional capacity in North America coming online over the next few quarters to which trade flows need to adjust and that will take time.","Buyers in the region remain risk-averse, with more purchasing in a just-in-time manner or selling and purchasing back-to-back. They also appear to be keeping lower inventories through the year. All of these factors, on top of the supply-driven global market, will restrain prices through the remainder of 2017 and into 2018.","We are well prepared for this challenge. We will continue to work with our customers and seek to deliver good overall margins for our business by moving tons to the right areas at the right time, utilizing storage, adjusting product mix and developing customers in new destinations. We have demonstrated our ability to do just that and are well positioned as the global nitrogen market continues to transition.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the second quarter of 2017, the company reported fully diluted earnings per share of $0.01 and EBITDA of $275 million. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.10 and adjusted EBITDA was $303 million. Our adjustments included an $18 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives.","As you've seen in recent quarters, the number and size of adjustments have decreased significantly compared to last year as we have reduced activity and completed our capacity expansion projects. We also restructured inter-company loans to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on these loans. These non-cash effects were significant in the first half of 2016, but not in 2017.","Our balance sheet remained strong. Our cash and cash equivalents were $2 billion as of June 30. At the end of the quarter, our $750 million revolving credit facility was undrawn. As we disclosed in June, we received $815 million in federal tax refunds due to the carryback of federal tax losses in 2016 to prior periods. These tax losses were driven primarily by federal tax bonus depreciation on our capacity expansion projects. We intend to use the proceeds from these refunds to retire $800 million of debt coming due in May of 2018. Once this occurs, our quarterly interest expense will decline from $80 million to approximately $66 million.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $217 million for the second quarter of 2017, up from $181 million in the second quarter of 2016. We expect full year 2017 D&A to be approximately $875 million. As we've discussed before, higher D&A this year is affecting gross margin per ton for all the applicable segments. We have again included segment tables in the press release and a chart on slide 9 to help you compare the gross margins in the second quarter to prior periods. In these tables and charts, we adjust depreciation and amortization and unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on natural gas derivatives from gross margin as reported to show an adjusted gross margin. We believe this will give you a better sense of the underlying cash generation capability of each segment.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2017 were $91 million. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $400 million for new activities. Additionally, as of June 30, 2017, approximately $175 million remains accrued but unpaid related to capacity expansion activities in 2016. Most of this unpaid amount is the subject of disputes with certain contractors and vendors and it is too soon to estimate the timing or final resolution of these matters.","I want to highlight the cost reductions we've achieved across our system. This is the result of our targeted efforts to reduce cost in our head office and at our plants. Our SG&A is down slightly compared to the same period last year, which is a meaningful achievement considering our increased production volumes and ever increasing regulatory and reporting requirements. We have the lowest SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fertilizer space and among the lowest in commodity chemicals generally.","At our manufacturing sites, reduced plant level activity and better procurement practices have decreased professional services, payroll and maintenance cost, resulting in a lower controllable cost of sales. As you can see on slide 10, we've reduced controllable cost of sales by $28 million compared to the second quarter of 2016 or about 15% per product ton. Year-to-date, these efforts have lowered controllable cost of sales by $45 million.","Now, I would like to provide some specific thoughts regarding our expectations for the third quarter of 2017. We expect to see higher volumes and lower controllable costs compared to the third quarter of 2016, due to our expansions and the cost reduction activities I just mentioned. But we believe these positive impacts will be more than offset by lower product pricing in the market today as well as higher gas cost compared to the third quarter of 2016.","As Bert mentioned, we launched our UAN fill program at $125 per short ton NOLA, which is about $15 to $20 lower than the last year. Tampa ammonia prices are $190 a metric ton today compared to about $280 a year ago. NOLA urea barge prices have recently moved up to around $185 per short ton, similar to last year.","If you compare natural gas prices with the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2017, Henry Hub prices are up about $0.25 per MMBtu and NBP prices are up about $0.80. Based on our typical consumption and factoring in our hedge position, this is about a $30 million natural gas headwind on its own. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe it is unlikely that our financial results for the third quarter of 2017 will exceed the $83 million of adjusted EBITDA reported in the third quarter of 2016.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize the winner of our 2017 Stephen R. Wilson Excellence in Safety Award, which was created to help us identify, honor and share the most impactful safety innovations and improvements made across our company every year. This year, our winning facility is the Courtright Nitrogen Complex for their innovative implementation of technology that eliminates the risk of high voltage arc flash incidence during infrared scans of our electrical equipment. They've also been nominated for an Ontario Electrical Safety Award for the idea. We're very proud of them and how this will improve safety across our system.","I want to thank all of our employees for their work during the quarter. They operated safely, they operated well and they operated as a team. Their execution is even more critical during the current challenging market environment and has positioned CF well for long-term success.","With that, Operator, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. So, clearly, the market is under pressure, which is dominating the headlines, but I think most will be happy to see you're not sitting idly at all. Just putting the market aside for a second and your views, can you just walk us through a little more on the controllable per ton costs, the versatility (20:07) of your assets, especially given your new DEF unit, as well as any transportation logistics benefits inherent in your strategy and how you think these should help you further weather the storm so to speak for the back half and into 2018? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. I'm going to ask a combination of folks to help answer that question, starting off with Chris Bohn on the controllable on the manufacturing side.","Christopher D. Bohn - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. On the controllable cost decrease that we saw, is a makeup of a combination of factors as you mentioned, the increased volume accounted for about 60% of that decrease of the 15% or roughly as Dennis had mentioned, $15 per ton. But in addition to that, we had lower maintenance and also lower labor cost as we put focus back on safety and reliability, where in the past we had some of our focus by our engineering team largely put towards improvement projects, and as we've seen those projects sort of tail off here, we've been able to reduce costs considerably by that.","But additionally, the plants operating as well as they have with the utilization over 100% in the quarter, that also really results in lower maintenance and it allows us during that timeframe to have more planned scheduled maintenance where there is lower costs related to that as well. So, this is something that we've increased the focus with all the general managers at the sites, we expect to continue the focus on that and probably lower activity by our engineering group on improvement projects.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Bert, you want to talk about the logistics?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure. Good morning, Chris. So, there are a lot of things we're doing just to \u2013 you say weather the storm. We just view it as optimizing our system and allowing ourselves to have ultimate optionality regarding markets we participate in, geographic areas, exports, storage. And so, we're maintaining our inventories low and we entered the fill season with an adequate inventory and we're exiting that kind of sales campaign in a good position, we've got a good order book on with lower inventory in the system, which we can utilize. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the options for exports on diesel, how we balance logistically.","What has become difficult I think for our industry is the rail rates. As rail rates have maintained high, specifically the UP and the BNSF, into some of the Midwest that has limited some options. So, we have become better and we will continue to improve the utilization of trucks throughout our system and serving our customers in that way.","So, we're always trying to look at our system, how we can improve it and how we can maximize. And I think a great example is the mega-tow that we used to haul UAN up the rivers and lower that net cost to the company.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just a quick follow-up. Can you just comment -","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Thanks for having me on the call. I'd like to ask about the sensitivity table, the EBITDA sensitivity table in the presentation, which is really helpful, thank you. The table I think is based on 2016 pricing relationships between urea and other products like UAN and ammonia, have any of these relationships changed over the past year or are expected to change, just looking at prices of urea for example, we're at $180 to $190 and UAN's at $120, it's pretty big gap versus historical levels. So any commentary around that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure, Andrew. This is Bert. On some of those \u2013 they are changing, we update this chart, but those products are changing, I wouldn't say daily, but they're changing with regularity as demand periods are being utilized, for example, ammonia is a fall application and as well as spring but UAN is principally a spring application and urea is more throughout the year. And so, as trade flows and as products come in, some products are weaker sometimes than the others but generally the historical spreads do hold and UAN has traded at a premium to urea and ammonia and urea as a premium to ammonia and so it kind of stair steps and we use that in a broad base.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. The other thing, Andrew, that I'd add to that is what we will do typically when we will provide projections to the management team here and also to the Board of Directors, we will sensitize our projection of not what's shown here on this table but our projections that we do internally, to whatever the latest view is on product premiums and what have you in different locations. And as we've done that and as those things change through time what we have found is that this table remains relatively robust. As we think about sort of where our projection is and we looked at the average gas pricing and the average realized urea price, it kind of \u2013 it remains relatively robust to the changes that we ourselves make to sort of the differences between the products.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just maybe just a follow-up on a longer-term kind of SMD (25:30) looking at your capacity additions, there are about 30 million tons of new capacity being added through to 2020, market grows historically at about 3 million to 4 million tons. I read your commentary that capacity additions slow down in 2019. Is that maybe when prices start getting a little bit better and we start seeing more meaningful increase or does it take maybe a little bit longer to absorb that new capacity? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, Andrew, I think one of the things that we would expect \u2013 there's a difference also between the kind of gross amount of new capacity coming online and what's net. So the one thing that I want to highlight is, there is an awful lot of capacity that's also shutting down, either because it's uneconomic to run it at current pricing or because feedstock availability is challenging or a combination of factors. And so, what's really important to look at is kind of what the net add is in each period versus the growth rate. But yeah, we would expect things to kind of get back to about level in 2018 and then start improving in 2019, and then accelerate the improvement as you get into 2020.","Part of kind of that is predicated on our belief that you can't have sort of an infinite amount of capital that's lost and across the global system. And in a lot of these regions, there isn't enough cash being generated to go through turnarounds on the operating units. And so, that's basically when they start shutting down.","So it certainly could happen sort of earlier than that, but at least the way that the data is playing out, we would expect kind of recovery to happen in sort of 2019 and then, accelerate as we go forward. That's a little bit later than we had said a call or two ago, and the principal reason for that is a lot of these projects are just delayed in terms of their start-up. And so, they cascade kind of out forward instead of starting up when they were originally scheduled to.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. We've seen at NOLA ammonia prices are now trading pretty much in line with urea, maybe at a small premium. Historically, when that premium has been near zero, just above zero for ammonia at NOLA, you've seen a sharp rebound in ammonia prices and pretty quickly. Now, is that possible this year considering all the new capacity coming on? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I believe it is. I think when you look at ammonia and the discounts that it's trading at is not sustainable. I think that's a reflection of one or two vessels that were traded and you look at the production cost for most people around the world and to supply ammonia delivered at $190 metric ton, means an FOB number that's probably close to production cost, again depending on your gas cost. And so, how we're looking at ammonia and because we're principally focused on the ag market and the demand and the ability to get that product up and through, the ability to supply on a two-week to four-week window, the separation between Tampa and the Midwest, I think will become more pronounced if Tampa stays at this level, because that does not reflect an ag value for ammonia applied to the ground.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. That's helpful. So my other question, in talking about some of the commentary around Q3. Of course, NOLA is up to $185 or $190 supposedly last night, it averaged for urea \u2013 excuse me, it averaged $180, the benchmark did, Q3 of last year. Your realized premium was only about $22, which isn't what you had in the past. So, when you talk about your commentary that might see lower prices and testing lows, can you elaborate on that a little bit more, because again we're seeing a rebound and to get to test lows, you'd have to see a very sharp decline and quickly?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, Andrew, one of the things about \u2013 Joel, I'm sorry. One of the things about the premium last year in market is that we didn't have the Port Neal urea plant up and operating. So, with more urea capacity sort of in market as opposed it being more NOLA-centric, that definitely helps from that perspective. But the challenge, as you know, there's very little product that is going to ground from an application standpoint from this point on until you get into the next application window in the spring, at least in the northern part of the Corn Belt system.","And so, urea that is being purchased is basically going in shed for the next nine months. And so, if you end with an extraneous vessel or two that shows up over here when it's not needed, particularly with some of the other capacity coming online. That can have a pretty outsized impact in terms of what local pricing is, and particularly with a bunch of traders and other folks having a short leash in terms of their open book and their risk positions, then that stuff just starts trading and it creates a cascade effect in terms of price. So, that's the cautionary word out there. It's not where price is today, it's the fact that all it takes is one extra vessel to kind of rain on the parade.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","So really the message to importers is to stay away. Is that right?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I mean, I guess the message to importers are \u2013 there's probably other better value places in the world from a destination market perspective, because if you come here and you cater the market by $30, you're not doing yourself any favors.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citibank. Your line is open.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. So, looking \u2013 I want to go back to one of the earlier questions about the supply\/demand balance. In 2015-2016, you've got about 12 million tons or 13 million tons of urea capacity getting shut down, but this year and next year, you only have 2 million tons or 3 million tons. So, can you just walk us through the factors why, even though market conditions maybe got worse, that you're not seeing as many permanent shutdowns as you saw in the past?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Boy, I think a lot of it just has to do with in terms of where the hydrocarbon spread is. You don't see as many people kind of \u2013 it's getting to a fairly flat plateau at the top end and you don't see as many people sitting well off the curve that are clearly upside down. So, when you get to a plateau period like that, then ultimately what's happening is, folks have to sort of they go through a period of time where they're not making cash, not hemorrhaging it, but not making it, and then when the next big turnaround cycle comes along, is typically when they're in the decision around shutting down. And so that's the expectation.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think that's also reflected in operating rates. And as the industry is operating around 80-plus percent, you don't have 100% of the static capacity available. And as \u2013 Tony is right, and I agree with him that, as prices remain low and cash is not available, that operating rate will continue to decline unless overall product will be available irrespective of the new capacity that's coming on.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then, Bert, I think you touched on this briefly in your prepared remarks. But can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of the U.S. dealer inventory level exiting the spring and going into the fill season? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We think it's very low. We think it was low as reflected in what we were able to accomplish in June and July, maintaining UAN prices at market levels and having consistent demand every day because if the inventory \u2013 the first desire for the retail chain is to be out of inventory at the end of the year. And so that generally happens earlier than they anticipate just because they don't want to carry it.","And then, we maintained our inventory position in the interior and continue to supply spot sales or new orders up to the day we launched our UAN fill program last week. And so that was for UAN urea. And then, earlier in the quarter, we launched a ammonia fill program, where these smaller bullets and smaller tanks \u2013 it's not a big program, but the industry participates in that, where you fill that up at one time and that was completely empty. So, we feel very, very positive going into Q3 and Q4 that we'll continue to grow, and as demand grows, and we can supply that product and fill those sheds for spring.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don this morning. Good morning.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So, I wondered if you could talk a little about your export strategy going into the back half, do you plan to export more than 2Q and yeah?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Okay. Go ahead, sorry.","Christopher D. Bohn - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","No, I mean, just sort of at a very high level as Bert commented and I'll let him get into more of the details. But one of the reasons we exported a bunch of ammonia in the first half was because even though our supply agreement with Mosaic was scheduled to begin at the beginning of the year, their vessel wasn't ready and you need a Jones Act registered vessel to be able to move product intra the U.S. And so when that vessel becomes available, a lot of our excess ammonia will get soaked up by the contract and so we won't really be in a position to need to export those tons.","The urea situation I think is really an opportunistic one, which is to the extent NOLA is trading at a discount to international marketplaces, it makes sense for us to go ahead and export because we can realize better netbacks. And on the UAN front, it's very situational depending in terms of what our opportunities look like and optimizing the whole. So, it's not that we have a stated strategy to export X or Y or not, it's really very opportunistic about maximizing netbacks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That's exactly right. And the other component to that is we spent several years working on this to put ourselves in the position to be able to execute against it, and so what you're seeing is a result of work by the various teams with relationships and agreements and destination facilities to be able to move those tons in an attractive way for the company. And so, take urea for example, some of those were just spot deals. We recognized an anomaly in the market in May and early June, executed quickly against it, so 90,000 tons of our Q2 urea position went to Central and South America for urea.","The UAN was more programmatic where we have some nice agreements in place and feel very comfortable with our ability to move that. A lot of that is inventory management as well. We produce a lot of UAN in Donaldsonville and we can ship it in various modes. But during this quarter, like Tony said, it's netback-driven and the netbacks were fairly attractive. So, I like the program. I like what we've put together. We're fairly a small team. We can execute quickly, have good relationships and enjoy doing that part of our business.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","All right. And just as a follow-up, is there anything you've observed in the NOLA inland product premiums, any compression in urea spreads or UAN spreads?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Not yet. I think Tony mentioned that there's the normal Q3, and we're in a normal Q3, where we're asking our customers to store that product for several months and pay cash up front, and so that does come at a discount. But we're fully expecting, and we saw this year the premium for all the products are holding and expect that into next year as well.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I would say, Ben, in that regard, we have seen some other producers in market drop their price well below kind of our price, which if you look at NOLA versus where they launched at, you'd say there was pretty significant compression. But in those instances, we just walked away because we didn't think that represented the accurate value and pricing of nitrogen on a per unit basis. And so I feel very comfortable in terms of where our price realization is going to be against a number of other producers inland.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sorry, guys. I think I got cut off there earlier.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We enjoy your questions so much, Chris, we want to space them out. Every 10 minutes, you'll have to ask another one.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, you haven't even heard my question yet. Bert hit on this a little, but I just want to dive in just one step further, can you just further comment on the domestic selling behavior over the last quarter, or really the last year and just, I think it's pretty clear that it's fairly unsustainable, especially given some Middle East imports. Can you just comment on your summer fill program \u2013 and I think another question alluded to this \u2013 and just kind of comment on your pricing and potentially deterring imports from the East Coast, specifically, I think some postings in Cincinnati. And just how do you think that is going to be able to alleviate the blow from certain new facilities, mainly OCI, coming online during the next few quarters? Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Okay. Chris. Yeah, thanks and welcome back.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, summer fill, we did launch it last week for UAN and we see it as a success. We targeted a certain amount of tonnage to be available during the quarter and into Q4, and we've achieved that. We've seen balanced purchasing from small, medium and large customers. We have not built much to our export book yet, so that potential still remains out there. But we feel comfortable with what we launched at NOLA, and then the step-ups to the Midwest. And I think pricing was pretty good, we launched at a level that we thought was attractive for our domestic customers. And you're right. The East Coast is our lowest netback in our system and our Louisiana vessel that we supply over there, we moved, I wouldn't say significant tons, but we moved tonnage over there as a new market for us that we didn't participate in several years ago, and we think with our logistic assets, we are now able to participate and plan to.","The Cincinnati option has been really good for us, where we're able to move a significant tonnage up in there, store it, and move it out by truck and rail as well as Stolthaven which we work with ENS. ENS (42:03) has been very supportive of our ability to move by rail into the Eastern market. So, probably our biggest growth market has been that Eastern seaboard and into the mid-corn region of the East.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But, Chris, you're absolutely right, in terms of thinking about like the Russian production, because we're not pricing off of what other people are doing. North America remains an import-driven marketplace. And so pricing really is established based on what the imported ton gets over here from. As I said, when some of the other producers out there, kind of want to blow their brains out, we just let them do it, and because our focus is really on the Russian tons that are coming over, and that's how we calculate where pricing should realistically sit, not based on what other people are doing.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And we think we're attractively priced, Coast, Gulf Coast, West Coast and so you're right. These new plants are coming online, we think they have a place in the market. And we're trying to continually grow the options and the advantages to us to be able to take care of our business, run our plants at a high rate and move the product ratably and maintain inventory and maintain a pricing structure that we believe is appropriate, reflects an appropriate value for the product to our end customer, which is the farmer.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks for letting me back in. Appreciate it.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to discuss sort of how you think about the fill program in the future. It seems like NOLA prices are probably less relevant and as OCI kind of reaches closer to full capacity, do you expect to have sort of different pricing for each region or how do you sort of think about how you establish the fill program going forward? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I'll say one thing and then ask Bert to get into the details, Michael, but we on our fill program, we do it on a delivered basis today. So, it's not one size fits all, it's kind of depending upon what the costs are to get to different areas. And, as I mentioned, it's not whether plant X or plant Y is up, because North America continues to be import-dependent and it's based on really what's the cost of the Russian tons getting over here. And so that sets the East Coast price in those East Coast tanks and then it sort of cascades in from there. But, Bert, do you want to...?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think the fill program will have a future, because again, especially with a liquid product like UAN, you're logistically-dependent to move incremental amounts on a continual basis. And so we have to have relationships and an understanding in place with our customers of where value lies to move this product, because we don't want to sit on it for six months. We can't sit on it for several months, and we can do different options with the plants in terms of product portfolio. But this is the business we're in, so we need to align with our customers and that's what we've done is sit down and try to figure that out.","Regarding other producers, you have to remember, the one you mentioned is probably 100,000 tons a month. That's not that much in a 14 million ton market. And so as a supplier, we believe we are a global supplier and this is a global market that we are always looking at all different options and trying to maximize the profitability of this company.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then just another question regarding kind of the future of fall ammonia, I mean how do you see that market with all the regulations evolving over the next few years, and is it better for CF longer-term to have a big fall ammonia market or is it better for it to be a more spring-dependent, UAN maybe having a bigger percentage of the market...?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I would say on the second question is it better, we're ambivalent on that. We want to do what's right, and we want our customers do what's right for them, and we do believe in the four Rs; right place, right time, right product, right rate. And fall ammonia plays a nice component in that. It's a very good \u2013 with adequate soil moisture applying at the right ambient temperature of 50 degrees, fall ammonia sets in and is available to the farmer in the spring. So it's a good utilization, I'm talking full utilization of the equipment, diesel, time, and value of the product.","It's going to be interesting this year in the fall because as we roll into November and the application period, today, ammonia represents an exceptional value, multi \u2013 I would say a decade low value for the farmer. And so we should see if price and decision making does have a correlation, low prices should incent more people to apply giving good weather conditions this fall, more ammonia. And by the way, we are just the company to take advantage of that, and we are pretty excited about it.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We have the largest as you know, Michael, ammonia distribution network between our terminals and our plants and so a robust ammonia application season plays well against our asset base and we're well situated to take advantage of it.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But no matter what happens, we have a balanced portfolio for ammonia of industrial, our contract with Mosaic, our ag business, our storage ability and then the ability to export if needed.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Danielle, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, we talked a lot about imports and the effects thereof, and it sounds as though you're seeing some effect of greater availability ex-CF within North America. My question is does this get heavier before it gets easier? In other words, is there a good amount of domestic supply outside of your sales, that's new, has been commissioned, that's only now or into the second half starting to bite?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, what's come online so far has been our production and other than that, nobody is fully operational that we know of. We know Agrium came up with some new tons for urea in Borger. We think they're up and operating. The Waggaman facility for industrial ammonia from Dyno has been up for the last year. We think OCI is up and down, I don't think they are fully operational yet. And then you have the Koch and the Dakota Gas tons that are ammonia to urea. And so we believe those tons can be absorbed into this market. We're still going to have to import 3 million tons to 4 million tons of urea, 1 million tons to 1.5 million tons of UAN, and some ammonia no matter what. And so, the import effects, I think the imports will continue to play a role, just probably less so, and that should give options for CF domestically as well as internationally and that we'll take advantage of.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think the bigger challenge a little bit, Matthew, is that you know, we have a very robust and well developed distribution network where we can store tons and kind of deal with the evolving buyer behavior. So when buyers are sitting on the sidelines there is other things we can do, whether it's, you know, at first (49:36) developed our export optionality or putting the tons into our storage system or whatnot.","Most of those other new plants that are coming up don't have those options available to them. And so, because they don't have a robust distribution network, and they don't have export optionality, they're sort of stuck a little bit. And therefore the thing that they tend to do is just drop price until they find some takers. And that does create a little bit of sloppiness, but again, we're not pricing off of what other people are doing, we're pricing off of the next ton into the market, which is in the case UAN, really a Russian ton.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, Tony. Let me ask then about your own plants, with the current market requiring such a priority on liquidity, when you're spending $400 million in CapEx over the course the year, are you delaying spending that you're accruing for 2018, 2019 and 2020 at this point?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Remember the $400 million also includes about $25 million to $30 million on the Donaldsonville DEF projects. So we've got 400,000 tons of DEF now on a urea equivalent basis at D'ville which gives us both great margin and product flexibility, optionality. If we cut things down to just purely kind of maintenance capital, keep the lights on, we can tighten our belt a little bit off of that number, and we're continuing to focus on that, as we look forward, clearly minimizing our fixed charges is top of the list. And Chris and his team, on the manufacturing side are well aware of that, and really focused on doing that exact thing.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","A lot of ground has been covered today. One thing that I didn't see in the slide deck that you have put in fairly consistently recently has been kind of the view of the cost curve and wondering if you had any new thoughts or any updated view on where kind of marginal cost, I presume Chinese anthracite would be sitting today and as you look into 2018?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We don't really have anything that's dramatically different from what we put out there in Q1. As I think most people know, we've added a new board member, John Eaves, who is the CEO of Arch Coal and one of \u2013 John has a tremendous background, but one of the things that's really terrific in the near-term is his understanding of coal markets globally and his visibility into what's going on in China, and I think that's kind of reinforced our position and we don't really have any changes from the Q1 material.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. That's helpful. And then, maybe a market structure question. And I think you alluded in your third quarter or in second half outlook remarks that imports should not be coming here given again where the U.S. prices are versus rest of the world, and the increase in domestic production. And I'm wondering as you look at that seaborne market globally, ex the U.S., if you think that there is enough liquidity there from key buyers in India, Brazil, Europe and others to really be able to absorb a reduced U.S. presence in the seaborne market. I'm just trying to think about how do we get U.S. prices back to international parity without cargoes finding the way back to NOLA because of the liquidity that is often found there, any thoughts there?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Adam, that's kind of spot-on, right. So if there was circa 50 million traded tons last year, and a slice of that came to the U.S., and we don't need that anymore, where do those tons go? And that's the nail on the head. And I think what happens is, you end up with higher cost facilities in some of these other regions for which imports are in option, but historically, haven't played a role. Those plants start coming under pressure. So in particular, Yara is shutting down a plant in France. And there is some other challenges with some other higher cost, marginal European production. Ukraine is down. China has taken a big slice of production down. And so, I think it's a combination of both less traded seaborne tons because the Chinese production is coming off. And also new destinations for some of that, instead of NOLA it will go other places. But that's why we see some ongoing kind of sloppiness in the market likely persisting through the back-end of this year and into next before we start getting a more robust pricing environment.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from BoA. Your line is open. Your line is open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Tony, you had mentioned earlier about what you view as important is the net capacity adds and as you define that metric, you have this roster of Chinese capacity, 2 million tons to 3 million tons you expect to be permanently shuddered over the next two years, three years. How do you come to a landing on that roster and do you \u2013 how would you assess the potential upside if say none of that restarts versus the downside of all of it coming back on-stream. How do you \u2013 you have feet on the ground that are giving you that assessment and maybe you could just highlight that a little bit?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So, Steve, we do have some people on the ground, we have the Chinese national imports organization that does travel over there with some of our product managers and we do have a page in here on page 32 that gives at least a listing of some of the tons and where they are sitting and what their feedstock is. And so, it's based on kind of an understanding. We did a pretty thorough analysis a year or two years ago, plant by plant build-up of what the feedstock was, what the cost was where the coal \u2013 where the feed came from and what the destination was, was it being used internally or was it going basically as an export-oriented plant, and it's a combination of some of that analysis along with where current coal prices are and honestly the restriction and challenges around gas availability and some of the environmental regs that have come up and it's the intersection of all of those that have led us to kind of this view of what capacity is, kind of likely in jeopardy over there.","Now, can things change? Sure. It could change either direction. But I think, there is a concerted effort by the regime to transition away from some of the zombie industries to get some improved environmental policies put in place. And I think that plays very well relative to where what we're projecting and may even give us some upside.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And Bert, you were talking earlier about the shift in buying patterns in North America to more of a just-in-time delivery expectation, shifting to the spring, et cetera. Do you expect that trend to continue? And in general, do you think that could lead to perhaps just lower fill pricing versus historical levels and perhaps tighter market conditions in the spring?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We've seen these patterns ebb and flow over the years as customers perceive value, they enter the market and they want to buy it. We used to have to limit the size of our fill program for UAN, and at one point it was 3 million tons and we had to limit it at that and those were healthy prices. Last year, we almost couldn't find a buyer, and we didn't do almost half of what we've already done this year. And so, each year is different, again, as a perceived value, the carrying opportunity for that retailer to realize a higher price in the market once he sells. And so I think that's why we've just been cautious and we've been pragmatic through this process of trying to understand the market and utilize what we can. But I do believe that they're in the business of selling \u2013 buying and selling and applying fertilizer for their farmer customers, and I think that will continue to grow. And I think we're moving towards a much more service-related side to that business than just a buying and storing and so we see those to our \u2013 that moves to our advantage and moves to our \u2013 those are the type of customers we want to deal with. So, we see the fill program and programs like that continuing to be an integral part of what we do.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The only thing I would add to that is, fill at $125 NOLA for instance is on a unit of nitrogen equivalent of about $180 urea and urea is $10 above that. And so, historically UAN trades at a premium to urea. When it gets upside down, then there tends to be a lot of interest. And we don't think that there is a lot of downward pressure coming on urea, we think it's found a pretty reasonable place to trade at, absent a spurious extra vessel. But that would be a local regional issue, not a global one. And therefore, when UAN price drops to a place that it's very competitive or priced below urea, we would expect there to be a pretty high take rate on fill. So, it's lower than it has been in the past, but we're still making pretty good cash margins at $125, and we feel comfortable with that.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Just taking the Chinese urea production to another level, do you guys think it's possible that China would choose to become a net importer of urea or do you think they sort of would want to stop at self-sufficiency?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think it's highly possible. We were actually following that story a little bit this year. I think as you look at the cost structure and what Tony mentioned earlier with the transition that's taking place in their economy, I think you have to take a little longer-term view, but longer-term could be a few years. There is adequate supply of low cost urea coming out of the Arab Gulf, that's logistically attractive. And where China is based in terms of their production base is more to the south and interior, but your consumption base is in the north. And so there are places where it makes sense to import product on an actual cost basis.","And so I think as this rolls out and we see some of these shutdowns that we're expecting and not any new plants being built, there is a high possibility or probability that imports \u2013 and it doesn't take much, 1 million tons here, 1 million tons there would be accretive to the market.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that. If we take slide 14 and just sort of get ourselves out to 2019, 2020, 2021, if we hold sort of current production cost constant, where do you think the U.S. cost advantage is on a short ton of urea basis, versus the high cost of production and that's actually operating when we get out sort of once the new capacity is coming on slower than demand?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, part of that, Vincent, is embedded in kind of the evolution of LNG markets and gas markets and so forth, which we've spent certainly some time kind of looking at. I would think in the neighborhood of $3.50 to $4 of gas spread is kind of a fairly reasonable sort of way to think about it. And the cost curve kind of continues and continues to evolve and will hold. But if you think about sort of roughly 25 MMBtu per metric ton of production, it takes more than that in the older plants, but in the current ones, the world-scale ones, you're talking somewhere in the neighborhood of about $100 of delta on cost before you basically load it on a ship and send it and then unload it. So, that could be $120, $125 pretty easily by the time something gets landed over here.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Back on slide 32. I just want to confirm you have none of the temporary idled capacity entering the permanent closure category by 2019?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That's correct. We don't have it in there. Again, it might be a bit of a conservative assumption, based on sort of what's happening from a cash loss perspective, but that is the approach that we've taken on this one.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Do you have a guess at temporary idles for 2018 and does price have to get above the 2016 levels for anything to restart here, given most of those temporary idles occurred in 2016?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, again, kind of our earlier comments was we expect challenging market conditions through the balance of 2017 and into 2018. So, if you impute what you will from that comment about pricing. But given, if you've got sort of status quo on coal-based cost, then I certainly would expect some of those temporary shutdowns to persist.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Morning, Sandy.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","A lot has been covered, but maybe you can help us to think about the market potential for diesel exhaust fluid. Discuss how the margins there compare what you can generate in the agricultural market? And then, if there is a sizable premium, how should we think about the potential for it to be competed away?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sandy, we love DEF. I'm going to let Bert talk about the market size, but our price utilization per urea equivalent ton is close to $100, between $80 and $100, depending upon where you are, but one of the benefits that we have is because of the number of locations that we produce it at, we can provide supply security to our major customers. And if you're a one-off plant, you can't do that. There's still a fair number of \"suppliers of DEF\" that are either bringing in prilled products and melting it down or transporting it in from Europe or other places, which is an expensive way to get it over here.","So, we operate, we think, on a pretty advantaged platform from a couple of perspectives, in that regard. And it does take a fair bit of capital, as we talked about at D'ville in order to be able to produce it, so it's not free and it's not something that everyone could just run out and do. And even if they have it at one location, it doesn't mean they can get the same kind of supply agreements that we can, given the surety of supply that a number of our key customers are looking for. So, we feel we have a pretty sizeable advantage in that regard. But, Bert, you want to talk about the evolution of demand and how we expect that to continue?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. It's been a very nice product. Everything you articulated is exactly where we are and we're excited about the growth. I would say we're at close to 1 million tons of urea equivalent tons of demand and we expect that to continue to grow. The Class 8 trucks, the power units that drive this today, are not even 50% converted and that will continue to grow. And then you've got the off-road rail, marine, if they do grow, I think that's a little more, several years out. But for the first time, as I said in my remarks, North America will pass Europe in total demand, but we expect both markets. And then if get China to grow, Brazil, some of these other areas longer term, that's just positive growth and positive environmental benefit. And so, when we talk about the 2% growth rate in this business, a lot of it is industrial growth, people only focus on the ag, but I would say half of the growth is now in the industrial segment and that will continue to be the case. And so, the premium, we're on all the Class 1 railroads, we're able to move the product, we've got a huge fleet now committed to DEF, great relationships and contracts in place with our customers. So, we have positioned ourselves well for this market.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The only thing I'd say, Sandy is, a million tons today growing at a pretty good clip is predicated on a dosing rate that's in the sort of 2% range, 2%, 2.5%. If it gets up to 5% dosage, which it certainly could, we could easily see over 2 million tons of demand. So, we think there is a fair bit of runway and that's one of the reasons why we built such a large capacity D'ville from a DEF perspective.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's helpful. Thank you. And just a follow-up question on you gas cost in Western Canada, does the company have a long-term projection for where the AECO spread to NYMEX will sit?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I don't think we have a long-term projection. We like it. I mean it's trading at times at $1 below the Hub. And when you look at as you march your way up through the Midwest and into Canada, each of those steps are positive or I would say lower gas costs for those plants. And with the gas production capable of coming out of Canada as well as the Bakken, we anticipate that AECO is going to stay at a fairly attractive rate to Henry Hub.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Sandy, one of things we look at is as the infrastructure gets built out in the Marcellus Basin, they're able to move more product up into the East Coast from that basin that pushes gas from Canada from the East back West and that just sort of accentuates that issue. And obviously going to have more gas coming out of Permian and some other places as well in the States. So gas that had been coming to the U.S., given everything that's happening here from Canada is going to get backed up and as that happens, we would anticipate that AECO spread will remain robust.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. I think you generated about $20 million in cash, exclusive of the tax benefit that you got this quarter. Now, maybe your payables are lower than they might be and maybe your inventories are a little higher than they might be. As a base case in the second half, do you think you're going to use working capital or are you going to throw off cash from working capital?","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I mean, Jeff, this Dennis. My \u2013 you look at what I said with respect to the third quarter, fourth quarter I don't know where we're going to be, but it's not impossible to believe that we may be using cash in the second half. I suspect we will use cash certainly in the third quarter but with respect to the second half as a whole, it's hard to say because it's really so dependent on what happens to price. If you look last year, we had a price rally in the fourth quarter going to the first quarter this year, whether that materializes this year or not and what the magnitude of that might be is going to really be what dictates a lot of that for the half.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. The other point, Jeff, that I'd remind people of is, we generated about $150 million of cash in the first quarter from operations and then another $20 million in the second. So kind of year-to-date we're up not that far away from $200 million of cash gen, and so if we dip into that a little bit of that here in the third quarter and then see what develops in the fourth quarter, we feel pretty comfortable about that.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. But I think the important point, Jeff, is even with these challenging conditions, the cash that we are generating covering our fixed charges, we just have a huge liquidity position as we've talked about.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, many of the fertilizer companies have been under all kinds of pressure with the nitrogen down cycle. Do you think that these sorts of pressures increase the probability of further consolidation in nitrogen fertilizer? Or do you think that they just create so many price inefficiencies for the valuations of companies that consolidation opportunities are diminished in an environment like this?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Now look, I mean, I think, consolidation is likely to occur, it was pretty public that one of the public fertilizer companies was evaluating strategic alternatives and looking for a sale, that they canceled that process. But I think that that's not uncommon. If there's basically $1 of synergy to be had in any given situation, $1 of synergy goes a lot farther in a lower premium environment, lower premium, because the base assets are priced lower to begin with, than it does in a high valuation environment. So, I would expect there to be ongoing consolidation.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Martin Jarosick for closing remarks.","Martin A.

Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Anthony, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of 2016 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $83 million and $725 million, respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","The third quarter typically has our lowest volumes and lowest realized prices of the year and this year was no different. The nitrogen cost curve has widened and flattened, pressuring product prices as a significant amount of new capacity has come online globally. As capacity was increasing, the cost to produce and move nitrogen into market was decreasing due to lower feedstock and ocean freight cost and currency devaluations in certain production regions.","In addition to low product prices and already seasonally low volume, the situation was exacerbated by a change in buyer behavior. The North American value chain delayed purchasing products given the reluctance to take inventory risks as the application season was still several months away and additional new capacity, including our own, will soon be online. As such, the channel largely took a wait and see approach to the quarter. The net result was sluggish demand in North America and nitrogen product prices that fell to multiyear lows and were often trading below international parity. Bert will discuss this in more detail including the moves we made in response to these conditions.","The business generated $83 million of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter despite the challenging market conditions. A welcome new development has been the strengthening market conditions of late. Both sales volume and product prices have increased since the end of the quarter as buyers are finally moving off the sidelines and beginning to prepare for the application season.","On our last call, we detailed plans to deal with difficult market conditions that are expected to persist through next year. Our continuing focus is safe, reliable operations, reducing our cost and capital expenditures and maintaining strong liquidity. At the end of the third quarter, we had over $1.5 billion in cash and an undrawn revolver.","Additionally, we expect to receive roughly $800 million in cash via tax refund in the third quarter next year, which is almost $3.50 per share, so we have the strong liquidity position we desire. We have also made great progress in reducing both SG& A and direct manufacturing cost.","In addition to our efforts to reduce cost and conserve cash, we highlighted our focus to complete the major capacity expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have done just that. As we announced in October, the new ammonia plant is online and producing. With the new ammonia, urea and UAN plants all running at or above nameplate capacity, the expansion project at Donaldsonville has been officially completed.","At Port Neal, we are on the process of starting up the plant. We had a successful test run of the urea granulation plant in September and gas and steam have been introduced into the ammonia plant and we're proceeding with the urea plant start-up in parallel. As a result, we expect both ammonia and urea production at Port Neal to begin soon.","To help make this happen, we have brought a seasoned team from Donaldsonville up to assist the Port Neal final commissioning and start-up of the plant, allowing us to leverage what we've learned from our experiences. With the completion of Donaldsonville and with Port Neal starting up, now is a good time to take a step back and assess the good and bad of the capacity expansion projects.","I want to start by referring to slide 11 of the materials posted to our website. The total capital cost to build the new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal was $5.2 billion. Those plants are expected to produce roughly 4 million product tons per year. However, CHS paid $2.8 billion and have the rights to 1.7 million tons of that production. So, that leaves $2.4 billion of capital and roughly 2.3 million product tons for CF's account. Therefore, our resulting net capital cost was roughly $1,050 per product ton of new capacity.","As page 13 suggests, while our costs have greatly exceeded our initial estimate, and we're certainly not happy about that, it is an all too common occurrence in the industry as every major North American project we could find reliable data on has similarly experienced significant cost overruns as well. What is ultimately important, though, is the capital cost per ton of new production capacity. As shown on page 13, our new plants at Donaldsonville and Port Neal have an effective capital cost per ton of production that is among the lowest of all the observable plants built recently in North America.","And what is really important, as detailed on page 14, is that the effective IRR for the projects remains significantly above our cost of capital despite the increased cost and lower product price environment. The net result of all of this is that we remain pretty happy with our decision to do the capacity expansion projects and the fact that we sold an equity interest to CHS.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk more about the market and our outlook in more detail. And then, Dennis will discuss our performance and our work on reshaping part of our debt capital structure. After which, I will offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. The supply driven market, the seasonal low demand period for fertilizer and changing buyer behavior pushed ammonia, urea and UAN prices lower throughout the third quarter, hitting multiyear lows for each of the products. In fact, nitrogen prices at the U.S. Gulf remained below international parity for most of the third quarter, as Tony mentioned.","Even as of late last week, NOLA urea is trading at approximately $10 per short ton below the rest of the world. The global oversupply of nitrogen and its pressure on prices is not a new story. As we have said before, we believe 2016 represents the high watermark for urea capacity additions globally with capacity additions projected to drop off sharply after mid-2017. As an industry, we have yet to see the full impact of the new North American production capacity, but that which has come online has begun to displace imports.","The low global prices have challenged the ability of high cost producers to operate. The marginal producer, which remains Chinese anthracite coal plants, have also seen production and transportation costs rise. Rail and trucking costs in China have increased and electricity subsidies for small urea producers were eliminated in April. Additionally, coal prices have increased due to government imposed mining restrictions.","Anthracite lump coal prices in China has been flat for most of the third quarter, but recent published reports suggest that prices have increased 20% to 30%. This is translated to additional plants in China shutting down and fewer Chinese products being offered in the international marketplace via exports. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 8 million metric tons of annual urea capacity has been shut down in China and we anticipate that number to continue to increase.","As fundamental economic pressure is affecting pricing, the Chinese port price per metric ton for urea had risen to about $220 as we enter November, up from $194 per metric ton at the end of September. Also, the average U.S. Gulf price for urea barge product was approximately $180 per short ton for the third quarter and today, it is $30 to $40 higher.","We anticipate that prices in the coming quarters will also be supported by stronger demand. During the low price environment of the third quarter, customers took a new approach to purchases. While the third quarter typically has the lowest prices and lowest volumes in North America, demand was pressured more than normal. Trend of lower prices over the last 18 months has increased inventory risk in the mind of the purchaser.","Over the last 10 years, customers have purchased forward, received a product out of season as inventory and then delivered the product to their customers for either fall or spring applications. Today, this is much less the case. Many domestic customers told us they did not want to purchase products in the third quarter, preferring instead to take a wait and see approach to understand how the market will develop, particularly with new capacity expected to come online in North America.","This approach was a deviation from historical purchasing patterns but we responded to this environment in a few specific ways. First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program and we capitalized on our flexibility to export from Donaldsonville, particularly for UAN. Our sales team has put in a great deal of work in recent years to open up new markets for our product and that effort is benefiting the company now.","In the third quarter, we exported a record amount of UAN for the first nine months of the year. UAN exports have increased 143% over the same period last year and risen from under 100,000 tons in 2012 to more than 700,000 tons year-to-date in 2016. We have also increased shipments of UAN to the East and Gulf Coast by way of a new vessel commission earlier this year, allowing CF to compete with imports. In the past, we have not participated in these regions in a significant way as farmers in the Corn Belt consume the vast majority of our UAN and cost effective freight options were limited.","We also have a significant amount of end market storage for our products with over 1.2 million tons of ammonia storage, 1.3 million tons of UAN and over 500,000 tons of urea storage across our network. Even if buyers sat for a while on the sideline, historically, we have been able to fully operate our plant and position product for when demand materializes.","As we have said many times, nitrogen is a necessary nutrient that has to be applied every year. Additionally, despite the record or near record corn and soybean crops expected this year, 2017 futures prices suggest continued profitability at the farm level for corn and soybeans.","We are forecasting 88 million acres of corn and for wheat acres to remain flat at 50 million acres. Assuming that the weather cooperate, when demand for fall application season begins, we expect it to be strong.","At the same time, we believe that North American downstream inventory of ammonia, urea and UAN is low following the spring application season. Urea imports were down 55% year-over-year in the third quarter as well, suggesting that purchasing activity will have to accelerate to be ready for spring.","With buyers holding off purchases, we expect there to be robust just-in-time demand during the application season which, as I've outlined, we believe we are uniquely positioned to provide.","We have also seen tremendous progress in our UK operations. Since CF purchased the plants at Ince and Billingham, the manufacturing teams have set a number of production records. The team there also delivered a record amount of fertilizer to UK farmers in July as their season began and they continue to move all of their products. We have also benefited from a continued decline in UK natural gas prices, which had an average price in the third quarter of 2016 of $4.08 per MMBtu compared to $6.44 per MMBtu in the same quarter of 2015.","For the North American natural gas market, the December NYMEX contracts started the quarter near $3.36 per MMBtu and is currently trading at around $2.79 per MMBtu.","During the third quarter of 2016, we did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for low cost North American natural gas.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the third quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $6 million and a net loss per diluted share of $0.13. Included in these results on a pre-tax basis were approximately $21 million in unrealized net mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives, a $22 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on an embedded derivative associated with the CHS strategic venture, $24 million of expansion cost for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, $18 million of start-up cost for the Donaldsonville ammonia plant, $3 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans, and $2 million of fees associated with the amendment of the private placement notes, partially offset by a $1 million gain on foreign currency derivatives.","When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $83 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.13. Included in these results is a realized loss of $11 million or $0.17 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the third quarter of 2016.","Our gross margin per ton of urea and UAN was affected by the commencement of depreciation of our capacity additions at Donaldsonville, which increased depreciation expense in the quarter by $19 million. Including this amount, total depreciation for the quarter amounted to about $83 million for the two segments and about $30 per ton and $43 per ton for urea and UAN, respectively. As we bring up the remaining plants, our depreciation will again increase.","In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $800 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior years, primarily related to the bonus depreciation provision in the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent in part on the timing of the completion of the expansion project at Port Neal. The company now projects the 2016 pre-tax loss excluding non-controlling interest. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $131 million on a pre-tax loss of $131 million. The amount recognized represents the reversal of tax provisions that we recorded in prior period this year.","Interest expense for the third quarter was $31 million with another $53 million of interest being capitalized in the quarter. As the capacity expansions are completed, interest capitalization will decrease dramatically, increasing reported interest expense on the income statement.","As you know, CHS is entitled to semiannual distributions resulting from its minority equity investment in CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC. The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS but not yet declared for the third quarter 2016 is approximately $22 million.","For the full year, the company expects to have total capital expenditures of approximately $2.3 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $450 million to $475 million will be for sustaining improvement and other projects. The total completed capital cost of all capacity expansion projects both at Donaldsonville and Port Neal is estimated to be approximately $5.2 billion.","For 2017, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million, returning CapEx to maintenance levels that continue our commitment to safe, compliant and reliable operations.","Let's turn now to our liquidity profile and capital structure. As we indicated in the release, due to the uncertain duration of the current low price environment, our company is taking steps to maintain strong liquidity and has made and is making certain changes to part of the debt capital structure to put in place financing more appropriate for the current business and operating environment.","As of September 30, 2016, the company had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of nearly $1.6 billion and undrawn revolver and was in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements and all debt instruments. In addition to maintaining strong liquidity, our intention is to put in place a capital structure for the business we are as opposed to the business we thought we would be a year ago.","We recently obtained required lender consent for an amendment of our revolving credit facility, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions that would, among other things, change and add financial covenants, reduce the facility size from $1.5 billion to $750 million and add security interest to provide credit enhancement to the lenders.","We believe this security enhancement gave the lenders confidence to give us the appropriate flexibility to continue paying our dividend. We expect to fund the prepayment of the senior notes due 2022, 2025 and 2027 and the related make whole amount with the issuance of new long-term secured debt borrowings under the company's revolving credit facility, cash on hand or a combination of any of the foregoing.","As many of you recall, we issued the private placement notes when we were in the middle of the proposed combination with certain businesses of OCI. Because of that, we were unable to issue traditional registered investment grade debt. Instead, we opted to issue private placement notes with longer maturities that were spread out over time to meet our capital needs.","However, the private placement covenant package is not appropriate for a standalone CF in the current operating environment. The intent of prepaying the private placement notes is to replace them with financing that has a long-term covenant structure more consistent with traditional debt capital for a cyclical industry.","Before I hand the call back to Tony, I would like to end by discussing our capital allocation philosophy, which has not changed. While the current pricing environment has impacted our ratings in the near-term, we remain committed to investment grade over the long-term.","We will continue our prudent approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018 and, again, in 2020. If you look at our slide 19, what you will see is that we have returned to shareholders more than twice as much as we have net invested in large projects and assets.","Looking at slide 20, you can see that since 2010, our approach has resulted in our shareholders having greatly increased exposure to our underlying business as measured by nitrogen nutrient tons per 1,000 shares.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. As we've tried to lay out in our slides on pages 22 through 26, we believe that CF is exceptionally well-positioned to benefit from recovery in the nitrogen sector. Although there is currently oversupply in the industry, global nitrogen demand is expected to continue to grow at roughly 2% per year.","There is a lack of new plants scheduled to come online post-2017. And as a result, the global supply-demand balance should tighten leading to an increase in product prices. As this price recovery begins in 2018 and continues thereafter, CF should benefit disproportionately.","As page 26 indicates a $25 per ton urea equivalent increase translates roughly to $350 million of additional EBITDA on an annual basis. Bert indicated that average published Q3 urea prices at NOLA was $180 per ton. However, prices are already $30 to $40 higher than that today.","With our new plant starting up and improving market conditions, we are very excited about the future.","With that, operator, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. As you mentioned, you've seen a nice little move in urea prices due to what's going on in China. But global UAN and ammonia hasn't really moved that much despite higher feedstock costs and some curtailments in Eastern Europe and even some extended maintenance in the Middle East.","Do you just simply believe it's a matter of time before prices rebound or is demand still really that sluggish? So, any color on UAN and ammonia would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, we are seeing \u2013 good morning, Chris. This is Bert. We are seeing UAN prices already move. Egypt just closed a tender this week and that was closed at $140 per metric ton, and that's up from the $125 level from the previous tender.","We're seeing that prices increase in Europe, in France, as well as other locations, and in the United States. So, we're seeing activity step up in North America over the last several weeks and pricing, correspondingly, is increasing.","Ammonia, we have not seen the big move yet for fall applications in North America, but we have pretty positive weather pattern in front of us, and we expect that to go fairly soon. Around the world, I think, with \u2013 around ammonia specifically, with the additions in Asia, the SABIC plant and some of the new capacity that has come online, that did pressure pricing in Q3. But we expect moderating prices on the upside as we roll into 2017.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just a little more comment \u2013 another question on ammonia, I suppose. Just can you comment on just what degree or what effect the competitor ammonia supply coming online during 3Q in the U.S. you believe affected your netbacks? And how do you think this is going to evolve over the next year or two, especially, in the context of what we're still seeing from Trinidad? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I think the ammonia situation for us \u2013 it is just a lower quarter on demand. You really don't have ag demand during Q3, so it's an industrial-focused quarter. And with Tampa pricing at a low level with contracts either based on Tampa or on gas that drives the lower price for the product. And so, for our specific price realization and demand we do expect that, obviously, we're going to see an improvement in Q4 with ag and then, rolling into next year.","Over the next year or two, you're right, there is additional capacity coming online. We expect most of that North American capacity to be converted into upgraded products and we have a two new plants coming online that are probably net losses for ammonia. And the current capacities coming on in the Gulf outside of CF is pretty much committed to Dyno and Cornerstone and some other movers.","So, we feel fairly good about the ammonia market as well as our ability to move and continue to participate through our terminal and distribution system in the ag as well as industrial market.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the impact that the higher rail rates have had on your operations. And specifically, when some of the new capacity comes on, what type of savings might be available and if the rail companies are willing to renegotiate some of those rates? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, we're constantly looking at all of our costs, as Tony has mentioned, whether that be SG&A, production, CapEx. I think that in this type of an environment, we're driven to do that and, obviously, logistics is one of those areas. And our logistics team has done a great job in terms of leveraging the various platforms that we have. And what we have done \u2013 I'll tell you \u2013 the rail rates have gone up and it has been an impact on UAN. And we have met with the railroads and we continue to do, whether it's spot situations or looking at the complex as a whole.","One of the things we did last year was we opened up Stolthaven, which allowed us to get on the NS and bypass some of the blocked activity we believe we're experiencing in Donaldsonville. We've also leveraged and moved up our barge participation on UAN, increasing the level and then, like I mentioned earlier, the exports.","And so, we're able to achieve a fairly attractive netback moving our product to all over the globe, but principally to Argentina, Uruguay, Europe and some new markets we're developing. And we've moved to France for less than $15 a ton, $14 a ton. We can't move to St. Louis for that on UAN. And so, as you see us develop and grow and mature, we're going to continue to leverage those options to benefit us.","Other opportunities for what we're doing \u2013 we've met with the railroads on shipping out of Port Neal. We have UP and BN servicing that plant and we've built that facility to fully load that product out by truck. And so, you have to take defensive measures during these times to be able to position yourselves to pull in the attractive pricing for rail and other logistical options and that's what we're doing.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And could you give any sort of quantification in terms of like how much money it might save you once the urea is fully up and running in Port Neal, in terms of trucking it out of Port Neal to other locations in Midwest versus what you're currently paying out of D-ville? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, it depends on where you go. I mean, obviously, D-ville is going to be a \u2013 it's a huge plant and we have a lot of urea coming out of there but most of it moves by barge and now we have the ability to move that up by vessel. Some of it will move by rail, but the product that we have been moving by rail into Iowa, Nebraska, the Dakotas, all of that will come out of Port Neal and that will all be very competitively positioned. And we can load the trucks with a pup so you can average more tons and lower your freight cost and we think that will reach 500 miles to 700 miles by truck outside of the plant. And so then it's going to have to be: do the railroads want to compete with that, and we've already worked with our customers to be able to receive this product. So, we believe that we have linked the system together to effectively serve and move our product at all times at the lowest cost possible.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Wondering if you could just put a little more context or frame around how soon \"soon\" might be at Port Neal \u2013 and maybe, what I'm trying to get at is just sort of the market dynamics seem to be a bit influx over how much incremental imports are going to be needed this year going into spring as a function of when new facilities start up. So, just curious what \"soon\" means and how it fits into your marketing strategy with the balance of your product?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Vincent. Yeah. So, as I said earlier, in September, we tested the granulation part of the urea plant. We have been stockpiling ammonia into the tanks and anyone who is in the Port Neal area has seen the flare stack lit up, so we've got gas and steam going into the reformer front-end.","As we work kind of from the reformer through the CO2 removal system, we're going to start sending CO2 over to the urea plant and then be able to pull ammonia out of the tanks. And so, that's what we're planning in terms of the parallel commissioning. So, it's very likely that urea will actually be online before the ammonia plant is fully up. It's a simpler plant to commission and granulation is already operational.","But our expectation is it's a matter of a couple of weeks, maybe three weeks or four weeks, depends upon the number of little issues that you find as go through it. But that was fairly consistent with our experience at Donaldsonville. And hopefully we'll be able to improve on that because of the great team we've got from D-ville that's up helping the Port Neal guys. So, I would say our expectation is urea, hopefully here by the end of this month and ammonia, plus or minus a week after.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just as a follow-up, Bert, you talked a little bit about sort of changing customer buying patterns. Sounds a little bit similar to me as what has happened in some of the other nutrients. So, just curious your view on total amount of storage capacity you have, whether you want to be or need to be more opportunistic with storage capacity.","And also, you mentioned the 1 million tons of UAN, the vessels. How we should think about sort of the incremental ability going forward to use vessels both for urea and UAN to be more flexible around changes in customer buying patterns?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes. So, when you look at our system, as I mentioned, we do have the flexibility first on production. So, we can produce ammonia, urea, UAN and some of the other products. We will continue to do that and leverage those options up and down as the market necessitates. Then, you go into loading options where you have pipe, barge, truck, rail, vessel. Then, you go next to terminal opportunities and where those terminals are. We have taken on some additional terminalling space, which we believe is in our long-term interest in markets that we have not necessarily participated as much in the past and we can effectively serve now with our logistical options.","But you're right, exports are a great opportunity because you can immediately put 40,000 tons out and load it in a day. And so, that's a great leverage point when you're looking at inventory at the plant and how you're moving it out incrementally into the interior. Buying patterns have changed and we anticipate that they'll probably be this way for another year or so. But at the end of the day, you do have to have your product in place to serve the farmer customer.","You can only move so many railcars per day and railcars can only make so many trips and they have to return empty and load out and get in line. And so, we believe as that window closes and every day is another lost shipment day, that that will challenge the delivery system. And this is more of a UAN story than it is for urea because I think you can move that up by barging up through the various terminals.","So, we're fairly positive looking forward into 2017. If you really look at it \u2013 if our Texas and Oklahoma, that will start applications in February; Midwest, March and then April, so you're not much more than four, five months away from application. We're just starting winter and we're already looking to spring. So, we think it's going to turn out pretty well for us.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much for all the detail. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. Bert, you mentioned you're looking at the opportunity to ship out of D-ville, UAN to both East Coast and West Coast, just curious about that. Does that reflect your view that post the start-up of OCI's Wever and your Port Neal plants, that UAN in the Corn Belt will become net balanced on UAN and you need to find new homes for the UAN out of D-ville?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't infer too much into that because what we're doing is just creating optionality for the company. And I would rather have 10 options to take 1 ton than have one option to take 10 tons. And so, we would rather create these options whether they be exports or the Coast. And we have looked at the Coast throughout the years and participated in various manners.","But today, when you look at the East Coast, that's a million-ton market that we probably had 50,000 to 100,000 tons five or six years ago and I think that presents a tremendous opportunity for us. That's why we're getting on the NS, looking to get on the CSX, utilizing Courtright on the CN.","The West Coast, we've got some good agreements and partnerships out there with some of the distributors. We're able to rail directly from Woodward on the BN from Donaldsonville and Port Neal on the UP, and we've been moving product by vessel through the Panama Canal to the West Coast, and that's an attractive opportunity for us.","But I wouldn't \u2013 yes, new products and new production is coming online in various parts of the country and we're going to continue to participate in those areas. We ourselves are adding capacity right in the heart of the Corn Belt and we're just preparing.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Steve, the other thing to kind of remember is, as we indicated, I think in some of our materials, the nitric acid and UAN plant at Donaldsonville is kind of the largest single train that's out there at 4,500 metric ton a day, which is about, at nameplate, about 5,000 short tons a day. And that plant is running over 20% above nameplate.","We've done several days here just even this week at over 6,000 tons a day. So, Bert has got a big job in terms of finding a home for all of that product given how well those plants are running. And as he pointed out, what we're trying to do is just try to get the best aggregate netback across the entire system.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a follow-up on that, Tony, given D-ville's effective capacity is going to be greater than nameplate, what would you say longer-term is the fraction of production of that plant that will likely be exported?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That's going to really vary based on market conditions, and the trade patterns are evolving and starting to adjust for where the new capacity comes out. We certainly have an ability to export as much as 3 million tons, 4 million tons a year but that wouldn't probably be our first choice, all other things considered.","The point though that I would like to highlight just to remind everybody of and we've got a slide to this effect in the appendix, that even after all of the new capacity that's in flight in North America comes online, North America is still going to be a very import-dependent region where there's about 30% of our total nitrogen demand has got to be met by imports. So, when we're exporting here and there, it really is just around the edges and, primarily, during periods of time when there isn't a lot going to ground in North America and there's demand in other regions. So, it's a way to maximize overall system netbacks, not a have-to-do kind of thing.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Just want to talk about the $1 billion of maturities that you're taking out in 2020. Maybe if you could elaborate a little more. I guess you had some pressure from the lenders on that with the covenant and I think some of that was related to the OCI deal. Can you just talk about some of the decisions around that and how soon you will be prepaying? Thanks.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure, Joel. This is Dennis. I think you're right, and we said that in our prepared remarks that, basically, those things were taken out in September as part of financing the OCI deal.","At the time we did that, we weren't in a position to issue registered debt or even 144A debt because we wouldn't have had the requisite financial information we needed to issue that. So, what we did is we looked at a couple of options. We looked at potentially taking out a three-year or five-year term loan to provide the financing. And the reason we rejected that option was because, effectively, if you look at the post closing of the OCI deal, there would have been, had we done that, around $4 billion worth of maturities occurring between sort of 2016 and 2020, 2021. And that was a concentration of maturities that really wasn't \u2013 that was a bit high risk for us. So, what we did, instead, is we went to the private placement market where we could basically throw a lot of those maturities further out to 2025 and also 2027, so that we would have a more laddered effect.","Now, with the business that we intended to have coming out of that deal, which would have included three new operating plants and through time, significantly less debt and also, the operating environment that we foresaw at that time, the covenant structure in the private placement notes was not perceived to be problematic.","But a couple of things happened since that point in time. A, we didn't do the CHS \u2013 we didn't do the OCI deal and so then we never got the three additional operating plants. In addition to that and certainly with respect to third quarter, things turned out a bit more adverse than we had anticipated.","And so, with that highlighted to us with the need to make sure that with respect to our long dated capital, that the long dated capital that we had in place to finance the business should be long dated capital that is consistent with a business that is cyclical and goes through ups and downs and is robust to that from a covenant perspective. And the reason that that's important to us is because having a more appropriate set of covenants gives us the flexibility, as I said, with respect to the revolving credit facility to continue to pay the dividend and do other things on the equity side that would be more difficult otherwise.","And so, the actions we're taking here are really around reducing the risk and uncertainty around that sort of stuff and putting our capital structure in a framework that's far more appropriate for the type of business that we are today and the environment we are in.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. That was helpful. And the second question will ask is on the ammonia contracts with Mosaic starting in January 1. So, Mosaic obviously disclosed, I guess, last week or it was this week, sorry, that the barge is late and so, they'll be taking products from you on a different way, maybe rail. Can you talk about \u2013 will you be getting the same, during this interim period for the barge, will you be getting the same netbacks and the minimum volume, any payment changes, maybe talk about anything going on in the interim? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Joel, we have been in, as you would imagine, very close communication with the guys at Mosaic. So, they have been keeping us abreast of what's going on from a delivery schedule perspective on the vessel. And Bert and his counterpart have been working well at coming up with different ways to manage that situation, whether it's giving them ammonia via the pipe or send some stuff up through their terminals, doing some timed product swaps and other things like that. So, we're on top of it and kind of managing it jointly with the Mosaic guys and don't foresee that is as any kind of real issue.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first, I want to go back to, I think, it was Vincent's question about Port Neal, a question around the impact on the tax refund next year. Can you just talk about what actually has to occur by year-end to ensure the receipt of that cash tax refund next year? And if the plant presumably is not fully operational by December 31, how that will impact the timing and scope of the tax refund?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes. Good morning, Adam. The plant has got to be basically put in service and operational in order for us to be able to depreciate it. So, we need the plant to be running. Now, that said, as I have talked about, it's not an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We've already tested the granulation plant at urea. We are ready to put CO2 into the urea melt plant, the synthesis plant, and kind of get that up and running. The offsite have all been sort of tested and are operational. And once we've got CO2 going over to the urea plant, then the front-end of the ammonia plant is operational.","So, again, this isn't an all-or-nothing kind of thing. We're putting sections of the plant in operation as we go. But again, our expectation here is, based on our experience at Donaldsonville, the urea plants are sister plants from one another and the one at D-ville started up within a week.","So, we think we have plenty of time to get it up and operational. The Port Neal ammonia plant is a lot less complex than the Port Neal is \u2013 or Port Neal is less complex than D-ville because Port Neal is a 2,200-ton a day plant where D-ville is a 3,300-ton a day plant and configuration of the Syn-Loop in Donaldsonville is much more complex. There's a whole 'nother section to it.","So, as we look at this, we feel very comfortable in terms of being able to get the plant online here by the end of the year and that's why we continue to say, it's $800 million in terms of the tax refund next year because we expect to get everything online.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Adam, this is Dennis. I just wanted to clarify something that I heard in your question. The timing of the refund doesn't have anything to do with what happens at Port Neal. The timing of the refund has to do with when you get your tax return in and when that gets processed through. And given what we anticipate today or what we see today, we anticipate that that will be a third quarter event next year, that is the refund.","As Tony described to you, the Port Neal piece has to do with the amount because it's what drives ultimately, for a portion of our depreciation, whether you have depreciation in your tax clause for 2016 that you carryback or whether you don't and how much. And like Tony said, it's not an all-or-nothing type thing, there's a sort of a continuum of outcomes, but our strong expectation remains that we'll be fully depreciating those assets this year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on \u2013 on slide 26 of your deck that has the EBITDA sensitivity to gas, urea prices. I just want to be clear, that's \u2013 the urea prices as you've laid them out, those are CF realized urea prices, not kind of a NOLA benchmark? And as I think about the current environment, maybe the environment for the next 6 months to 12 months where you're finding the value of ammonia and UAN on an end ton basis, the spreads are a little bit different than they've been historically and I presume how you would envision them prospectively, your results over the next, call it 2017, wouldn't necessarily mirror this table, given differences in spreads and product prices.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, as you point out, this is based on kind of a pro forma simulation of the various spreads that existed for our last full year, which was 2015 and if there are differences going forward, that's going to change. The vertical axis is our realized price, but I think in the third quarter, the published average NOLA price was $180 and our realized price was a little over $200. And so, we would expect that spread to go up once Port Neal comes online because we are adding about 1.4 million tons in market that's going to have a $30 a ton, $40 a ton premium associated with it because of transportation cost from the Gulf. And so, that kind of gives you a general sense of kind of the premium to the Gulf that we would expect.","In addition, although ammonia is a little bit different animal because of the volume that's available out there in the deepwater market, we would expect UAN premium to come back in line with urea. And we can switch back and forth between granulating more or producing more solution, depending upon where that premium sits. And to the extent that you don't get the corresponding bumps that you would expect in UAN, we'll just shift the product mix.","So, I think over the medium-term to long-term, those things have to come back into rough equilibrium. Otherwise the producers are going to shift the mix and the end values have to trade at a minimum on parity with very likely UAN continuing to command a premium the way it has.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi. I was hoping you could comment on the weakness in industrial demand that you cited in your release and I assume some of that is phosphates. But is there anything worth highlighting in the DEF market? And on DEF, do you have any updated thoughts on how that market demand evolves over time?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes. So, when we mentioned the weakness, it's more the weakness in the ammonia price structure and why that was driven more in relation to the contractual structure of our industrial book of business, which is gas-based as well as Tampa-based and Tampa is very low.","Demand has been a little bit lower in the industrial segment due to some of the issues around caprolactam and phosphate. I think it's just with more of additional phosphate exports out of China has put a little more pressure on some of the other phosphate producers in terms of overall volumes and possible changes in mix as moving some to micro nutrients, as Mosaic has mentioned, away from possibly that. So, weakness \u2013 I don't think it's anything we're concerned about. Our volumes are, we think, going to hold steady.","Regarding DEF, we're very \u2013 we're positive what's going on in the DEF market, continued demand. We're going to have a record year on DEF volume. Pricing is holding up. We're continuing to see the growth of 30% to 40% that we have seen year-on-year. I do think just due to this slight slowdown in shipments, you have probably seen the Class 8 truck volume \u2013 the new truck volume slowing down a little bit on that end, but you do have additional demand coming from off-road as well as different segments. So, we're positive on the DEF front and continue to invest and grow and build the team and participate in that business.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up question on ammonia, a significant nitrogen equivalent discount to urea and UAN that you were discussing. Do you see this having any meaningful impact on how growers choose to apply nitrogen? Are there any early reads on direct application demand for ammonia versus demand for urea and UAN resulting from the lower prices?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","There's something important to remember here, which is the ammonia price, when it's weak, it primarily affects the industrial demand that Bert was talking about. In order to be able to get ammonia into the farmer's fields, you have to have a place to move it to. And it's not like urea where you can just leave it on a railcar, put it in a shed kind of thing. And UAN, there's a lot of availability of tank space.","With ammonia, you have to have big cryogenic storage tanks. There's principally only three companies and they are the producers that own those. CF has got the largest network of the ammonia tank terminal system. Koch has got some and Agrium has got some and then there's kind of onesie-twosie tanks here and there that are owned by other people like Trammo and so forth.","But if you don't have the storage terminals, then you can't take Gulf ammonia up into the marketplace and get it in the hands of the farmers because you've got no place to move it through. And so, even though there is some impact in terms of agricultural demand or agricultural prices for ammonia, it's not directly tied to Tampa ammonia the way urea price in the Midwest is tied to NOLA urea price.","So, that's one of the reasons why the distribution terminal system that we've got in ammonia is so valuable because it allows us to capture a pretty sizable spread between the value of agricultural ammonia versus cheap or relatively cheap deepwater ammonia.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Relative to your question on demand and changes in demand patterns, we've experienced two falls, 2014 and 2015, that were below expectations and below normal but that was weather-driven. And then, we experienced two record springs in 2015 and 2016.","And so, as I mentioned earlier, when you look out on a10-day to 30-day forecast, we see some positive developments in all of our terminal region even up in Canada, which receives snow in October. In limited applications, we see that drying out and temperatures staying in the 50s in the afternoon, allowing probably the applications to accelerate.","And when you look at, as a farmer, for corn, you have a number of options for and applications thereof. For ammonia, traditionally, in the past, it was 180 pounds per acre, you put it on the fall and you plant it in the spring and off you go. That has changed with a different agronomic prescription. And so, we have seen a little bit less applied in the fall and then pick-up an additional applications in the spring two, three and four stage applications, a combination of ammonia maybe side dress ammonia or UAN top dress or even flying over with urea. Each of those are positive for us. And so, we do see ammonia in the fall as a component to good agronomic corn practices and we see that continuing.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. You talked about getting back to investment grade. I'm sure your creditors pressured you on the dividend here through these discussions. Can you get back to investment grade without adjusting the dividend? And then, once you get back to free cash flow positive again, is that a priority over buybacks or how do you think about the priority?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So, John, on the dividend, if you look at our balance sheet, we have almost $1.6 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We've got an undrawn revolver. We've got $800 million of cash coming to us next year in the form of a tax refund. And so, that's before dollar one of operating profit. And so, the problem is not from an investment grade standpoint, the dividend or our liquidity situation \u2013 we have plenty of cash. The issue is all around in the near-term, the pricing environment and the EBITDA generation relative to the aggregate amount of debt that we've got outstanding on the business.","And so, change the dividend, don't change the dividends, it doesn't have a meaningful impact in terms of that particular metric and that's why we worked really hard on the secured credit facility to make sure that we've got the flexibility that allows us to continue paying the dividend going forward because that's an important element for the equity holders.","So, our focus is to get back to investment grade and we are planning, as Dennis articulated earlier, to retire the debt that comes due in 2018, that's $800 million. And so, we'll be de-levering at that point, that will certainly help. And then, as we move into price recovery in the sector about that time, we expect that will help as well. So, we're going through a short duration situation here but it's not really dividend-dependent. Dennis, do you have other...","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","No, I think that's right.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And then, secondly the industry, obviously, has a very high level of M&A activity underway. You've been a participant in the past. What are your current thoughts around the industry consolidation?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I think consolidation, generally speaking, is a constructive force. It allows for kind of rational behavior and, in general, there's synergies to be had. So, I think it's the kind of natural consequence of things when you go through these cyclical troughs, periods like we're going right now.","Sorry, let me go back to one question, the second half of the question you asked earlier which is, is our preference dividend or share repurchase. As a general theme, we like to maintain the dividend. We don't want to be in a situation where we're reducing that. But I think on a day-in, day-out basis for consistent and timely return of capital back to the shareholders, our biases towards share repurchase, we think that tends to be a more efficient vehicle to do that with.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good pivot away from the M&A question.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Anthony Fusco for closing remarks.","Anthony Fusco - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning.

I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are as listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining the CF Industries first half and second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Developments and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its first half and second quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning everyone. Last night we posted our financial results for the second quarter and first half of 2018 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $468 million and $764 million, respectively. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $303 million and $575 million for the same periods in 2017.","These results reflect both higher global nitrogen prices as well as lower North American natural gas costs. Our results were also enabled by our unmatched network of plants, terminals and logistics capabilities which allowed us to effectively move our products in the weather shortened application period this year. We were able to ship a company record 5.5 million product tons in the second quarter with almost 4 million tons of that in May and June alone.","As we look ahead to the rest of 2018, we are optimistic. Increased energy costs, particularly for producers in Europe and China, have raised and flattened the upper half of the global cost curve necessitating higher nitrogen prices. Longer-term, we expect the global nitrogen supply and demand balance to continue to tighten through at least 2022.","Over the next several years, demand growth should outpace net global capacity additions as shown on slide 10. Because it takes roughly four years to construct an ammonia urea complex, it is unlikely that additional plants will come online during this time period beyond what is already visibly under construction today.","At the same time, announced closures will offset much of the new capacity that does come online. In fact in 2018, the 4.3 million metric tons of nameplate urea capacity coming online is more than offset by the approximately 7 million tons of urea capacity expected to close permanently in Brazil, China and Kuwait.","As a result, global nitrogen price recovery is underway. Because we are one of the world's largest producers of nitrogen products and enjoy among the very lowest energy costs, this price recovery should benefit CF Industries disproportionately in the years ahead.","Our outlook for both the second half of 2018 and the longer term is increasingly positive. For these reasons, our board has authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, while we also reaffirm our commitment to repay the remaining notes due in May 2020 on or before their maturity date.","Now let me turn it over to Bert, who'll talk about the stronger market environment in more detail. Then Dennis will discuss our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. When we spoke in May, we were confident that fertilizer demand delayed by unfavorable weather would fully materialize by the end of the first half. Once farmers got into their fields in May, this is exactly what happened.","The technology that farmers use today enables them to catch up on plantings if there is a late start to the season. Our system is perfectly positioned to support a situation such as this. We're able to shift production to the most profitable product, store a significant amount of product for months, and move tons through to our network including exports to maximize our overall margin.","As a result, we were ready this spring when farmers planted 89 million acres of corn in a short amount of time and required fertilizer in a very tight window.","We waited for demand to emerge and sold our production and inventories into favorable market conditions. Prices in North America rose from the lows of early May. And our terminals were often the last source of prompt product in many areas. This allowed us to capture solid prices through the end of the spring season and the end of the quarter with low inventories for our system, as we always planned to do.","Entering the third quarter, we are very pleased with our position in the strongest global nitrogen market in the last few years. Energy costs in other region have increased significantly. In Europe, the price of natural gas per MMBtu at the Dutch TTF natural gas hub was 53% higher in June 2018 compared to June 2017, leading to the idling of several plants. The Dutch TTF forward curve suggests continued increases in the price of natural gas in Europe into 2019, which will continue to support global nitrogen prices.","The same case holds for Asian LNG. Chinese producers are facing higher energy costs as well with the price per metric ton of anthracite coal 32% higher in May 2018 compared to May 2017. Additionally, the enforcement in environmental regulations continues to reduce production.","As a result, Chinese urea exports declined dramatically. China exported 710,000 metric tons of urea from January through June 2018, a 74% decrease from the same period in the prior year.","This has supported urea barge prices at New Orleans at levels well above the unsustainable lows they reached during the second and third quarters last year. Through the first month of the third quarter, the price of urea at New Orleans has averaged almost $80 per ton higher than July 2017.","Additionally, global demand should maintain a higher floor for global nitrogen prices. We expect strong demand in Brazil through the end of the year as that country makes up for lower imports in the first half of the year and the closure of the two Petrobras nitrogen plants. Providing further support, India closed their urea tender yesterday.","We believe our positive outlook for nitrogen is shared by many of our customers, as reflected in the solid order book we have for fall ammonia applications and shipments for UAN and urea. Our successful ammonia and UAN fill program saw the return of some forward buying.","All of these indicators point to the most positive nitrogen environment we've operated in for several years. With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.63, EBITDA of $470 million and adjusted EBITDA of $468 million. These results reflect our strong operational performance, higher global nitrogen prices and lower natural gas costs compared to the prior period.","These factors along with lower interest payments due to our repayment of \u2013 last year of $1.1 billion in debt and our now full ownership of the Verdigris Nitrogen Complex drove substantial cash generation in the quarter.","Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $728 million as of June 30. Toward the end of July, our cash and cash equivalents balance was around $900 million as strong demand and higher prices continued into the third quarter.","As the cyclical nitrogen recovery continues, we expect that our cash generation will increase. As we have previously stated, we expect to repay the remaining $500 million of public senior notes on or before the May 2020 maturity date. In addition, and in line with our long-standing capital allocation philosophy, we are able to begin distributing excess capital to shareholders through the $500 million share repurchase program our board of directors has authorized. This will support our goal of increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business as measured by tons of nitrogen capacity per 1,000 shares.","Looking ahead to the end of the year, we continue to expect our capital expenditures to be approximately $400 million to $450 million for new activities. Capital expenditures through the second quarter of 2018 were $145 million. As we have said previously, we have a higher number of planned turnarounds in 2018 compared to 2017. The majority of our turnaround activity will take place in the third and fourth quarters.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize all of our employees for their outstanding work through the first six months of the year. They continue to execute our business exceptionally well. Most importantly, we are operating safely and efficiently. Our 12-month recordable incident rate continues to be well below 0.7, which is also well below industry averages. What's particularly impressive though is that our employees don't just avoid injuries, they actively work to prevent them through great safety innovations. We highlight the best of these each year through our Stephen R. Wilson Excellence in Safety Award and the finalist videos are posted on YouTube.","This year our winning facility is the Woodward Nitrogen Complex. They designed a custom-built fan break and lockout system to improve the way we stop and control driveshafts for the large fans in our cooling towers. We believe this will improve safety not just at our facilities where we have more than 100 such fans, but across our industry and other industries as well. I encourage you to look at the finalist videos as they truly demonstrate the passion our employees have for safety and improving the way we work.","CF is well positioned for both the near-term and longer-term. We continue to operate exceptionally well. We have a cost advantaged platform and industry fundamentals should continue to strengthen over the next several years. Because of our focused portfolio and our scale, we expect to benefit disproportionately.","With that operator, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question or comment comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I guess all my question center just on the outlook for the industry and the cost curve. Clearly, you've seen the energy prices rise in Europe and China. I'm just trying to think about some of the changes you've made to announce closures on the urea side. I think you've forecasted 1.9 million more closures in China this year on the urea side. And also want to think about ammonia and what that does in Europe to ammonia prices and how to think about the merchant ammonia market for the balance of the year?","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Okay. Well looking at our outlook, we were pretty clear in terms of what's happening around the world at different supply points with cost of production whether that'd be European gas costs being in the $7 to $8 range, coal costs increasing year-on-year as well as the limitations on pollution and we're seeing that today. There was announcement that came out that China is estimated to be operating at 51%. At that level of operation, that barely supplies the Chinese market. So the millions of tons that we have seen come out of China over the last several years is likely to continue to decrease to the levels of maybe even less than 1 million tons. And then the other announcements that Tony discussed, Kuwait and Brazil; and so all those on the net positive or on the net supply and demand position of nitrogen is positive for the market.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The increase in the closures in China is based on additional announcements that have come out since then. So we're just compiling public announcements made by companies and roll those together. And to your last point on ammonia, as you've seen the market move, whether that be Tampa, Black Sea or Baltic on the values of FOB ammonia, have increased month-on-month and we expect those to continue to roll up or increase as a result of some of these plants that are now offline and were buying or importing ammonia to run their upgrade just on a competitive position. And CF has done that ourselves at our UK facility, bringing in extra ammonia at a cost lower than we can produce in the UK.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. As Bert said, its $7 to $8 gas. If you're a European producer, you're talking about something well north of $250 to probably closer to $300 of cash cost. And so, it's a tough market out there.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And the other thing I'd add \u2013 this is Dennis, sorry. If you think about our outlook, our outlook as Tony stated, is for tightening market and also a higher cost curve as we go into sort of the period now to save the early 2020. And the reason for that is not just the forward curve on the various hydrocarbon inputs that are part of the cost curve, but also some leading indicators. If you haven't read it, I encourage you to read the IEA July 17, 2018 report. And what it shows is that if you think about it from an upstream perspective, exploration spending is down significantly, has been for a number of years now and it's at the lowest point as a percentage of the major's total investment.","Greenfield investment in oil and gas is also down. We do see increased spending in shale in North America primarily in the Permian, and that is subject obviously, as you know, to steep decline rates. We've also seen onshore brownfield investment increase, but that's mostly by NOCs, national oil companies and a lot of that is rate acceleration which means the barrel produced today can't be produced later.","Liquefaction investment is down from a high in 2014 of about $35 billion to $15 billion in 2018 and it's going down. And IEA believes that LNG will tighten significantly between now and 2023. And in addition to that, coal mining and washing is down 13% year-on-year, 17% to 16% and in China, it's down 15%. So as we think about the various elements of the cost curve and we look at these things as leading indicators, that gives us confidence that the sort of the forward pricing curves that we're looking at while there will still be volatility around those things, our sense is that they will be around a higher structural mean.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Other than in North America where of course the forward curve is very attractive.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So again, that's really \u2013 it's both the S&D balance in nitrogen and also the global cost position where we said that give us a lot of confidence about the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Hey, guys. So just given the final ramp up of some of UAN capacity in the U.S., can you just talk a little more about how you're projecting the balance for the U.S. UAN market given the current production mixes as well as your long-term expectations? And then just also just any quick update on your international product development efforts especially in LatAm? Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning. Well, so looking at the UAN capacity, we have seen the plants that were constructed over the last four, five years, ours included, come online and operate fully in 2018. And so as we've talked about 2018, it's been a year of transition, these plants figuring out their new logistical limitations, constraints and opportunities. And I think the balance in the United States what we've seen is imports have come down from over 3 million tons and we think that will level off probably into the 1.5 million ton range or need to. And you've seen CF expand into different markets out of the need to balance our production going into more of the East Coast of the United States, West Coast of the United States, as well as, like you mentioned, the international development. And we've been very successful in moving our UAN to South America, Australia, Europe and even Ukraine. And these are markets we've enjoyed developing and developing not only the relationships with the supply opportunity for us.","And so, as Tony mentioned, with our low cost gas structure, we believe and obviously the opportunity we have on freight coming out of NOLA which has been advantaged. It positions us very well. And so, in South America we have been developing. We're the largest supplier in Argentina. We've been spending considerable time in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico for those markets to help grow. We believe they will continue to grow especially Brazil.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And we see what, a couple hundred thousand tons more likely growth next year in terms of Latin America consumption?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I'd say it's conservative.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And it's one of the \u2013 I think Bert and his team have done a tremendous job of, which is really opening up different markets for us. And Chris, because of the question about what else is going on and what are we doing particularly in Latin America, I just want to bring up one topic that has been sort of talked about a little bit. We have not received formal notification of this yet, but there's a rumor out there that the European Commission is looking at an anti-dumping case relative to UAN imports into Europe. And from our perspective, nitrogen and UAN in particular, it's a global market. We're price takers like everybody else and prices are basically set by other nitrogen alternatives, but I think what this really demonstrates is how economically challenging it is for the European producers given their cost structure.","And life is tough in the fourth quartile. They already have a 6.5% protectionist tariff for imported products and yet they're still really struggling economically. And this is essentially a move to try to prop up the European producer economics really at the end of the day at the expense of European farmers.","And so while the Commission may go and do this evaluation, I think it's politically going to be really hard for them to want to go ahead and essentially sponsor kind of increased cost to the farming community when it's already in the area that requires a fair bit of support and subsidy.","And for us, Europe is not that critical. It represents only about 1% of our EBITDA. And because Bert and his team are really developing Latin America and other alternatives for us, we can usually redirect those tons someplace else regardless of what the European Commission may or may not do.","Again, this is all a little preemptive because we haven't received formal notice yet, but I just don't want people freaking out if and when it comes, because we've already got mitigation factors in place. And again, at the end of the day, all that's going to happen here is European farmers are going to have to pay more for their product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to delve a little bit deeper into the fill program. I know you mentioned you had successful UAN and ammonia fill. And I know the UAN fill came out a little bit earlier. But maybe you could talk about how your forward book looks versus last year and kind of your strategy going forward. It seems like you might have been able to sell a little more than you did. So any commentary on the fill programs would be good.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. I think we're \u2013 I don't think, actually \u2013 I know we're pleased with our fill programs this year and how we executed and how the team performed and worked with our customers to do this in a logical and organized manner.","And so each year the fill programs are different depending on the economics, the economics of fertilizer, the economics of corn and soybeans and what's going on at the farm gate as well as global economic conditions.","And we've had the program start as early as early June and last year we went in late July. This year we launched on July 9, figuring that was an opportunistic time because of those factors that I earlier articulated aligned and positioned the company well with expectations with our customers.","So we put a program out on UAN and it was, in terms of overall volume, larger than the previous year. But you have to remember in 2017 and 2016, those were both very small years for a fill program, purposefully set out that way by CF because pricing or nitrogen pricing during that period was very low. And so it was not very attractive for us to put a big program.","Roll into 2018, and as I mentioned urea is at $80 over last year's July posted pricing. And UAN in the same vein, we were able to launch at a higher level, received well by our customers. We think it's a good economic opportunity for them as well as ourselves. And so we're pleased with it.","And same thing with ammonia. Ammonia was launched in mid-June for fall applications. And we thought that pricing structure was attractive for fall. There are two periods of application of ammonia in the United States, November generally and April. And so we wanted to have a portion of our book out for that period and there's still more to be done.","And so I think we're well-positioned for the latter half or back half of 2018 with ample opportunities to move our product for each of the plants, which is a logistical challenge always. And then we'll see what happens in Q4.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. Yes, Bert, can you comment on your overall level of export activity across not just UAN, but ammonia and urea as well? And what are the prices relative to what you can realize in the NOLA area? And are you still seeing some of this index-linked imports coming into New Orleans and depressing prices?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Don. So the overall export program, we view it as an opportunistic leverage point for our whole complex of operation. And so as we develop relationships in different countries, we're developing relationships in the United States and Canada also.","The beauty of Donaldsonville is its leverage capability, it's on the pipeline, it's on the water, it's got deepwater docks, it's got rail loading, it's got truck loading. And so exports, as it's currently configured, is we're able to load close to Panamax size vessels of dry product as well as 40,000 to almost 50,000 tons of UAN.","So the total volume is roughly 1.5 million tons of UAN, it looks like, for this year, probably 0.5 million tons of urea, and then ammonia is also opportunistic as we roll into the fall and see how that goes if there are better opportunities.","But pricing-wise, it's similar to generally better. We were surprised when we went to IFA in June this year and what we were able to transact for what NOLA was pricing, as NOLA has been in a discount.","And so if we're able to move product, we're ambivalent to where that product moves. If we can make more money exporting product, we will continue to do that. If North America is more attractive, you'll see exports decrease. And that's kind of how we look at it. It's kind of a flywheel to our system.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But I think, Don, though we do see less tons actually showing up in NOLA or some of the other import on an index basis. I think a number of the Middle Eastern producers sort of recognize that they were leaving money on the table by doing that. And in fact, some of the people doing the importing were not able to realize any kind of price appreciation on the capital that they were putting out for inventory given the excess amount of tonnage that was coming through. So we are beginning to see, I'd say, a more rational behavior out there on the importer side. And I think that's constructive. My guess is it'll take another six months to a year to really shake itself out but certainly an improving dynamic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, guys. Just looking at your slide 22 and it's a little different from the one in the last presentation just because you removed 15 and added 22, but there're obviously some other changes as well. And particularly, we already talked about your expectations for 2018 closures but it looks like in 2019 the expectations for closures is also higher.","So could you just address that? Is that just public data or is that a forecast? And then in 2020 \u2013 now 2022 is on the slide, it wasn't on the prior slide. So any changes to sort of the cadence of capacity additions in the out years things delayed, et cetera? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So what's baked into this chart is really kind of the details on a lot of that. It is shown on the next page, on 23, which kind of gives you the kind of the new global urea plants. And then on 24, it shows you kind of what has been identified in various announcements and filings around shutdowns. And so what we've got in here basically is all announced other than there is one slug in 2019 that are based on where those plants set in the global cost curve and where pricing is. And what we've looked at is the amount of volume on plants that are losing more than $25 per ton on just an energy cost basis. And those that are in places where there is a pretty rigid enforcement on some of the emissions and environmental standards. And that kind of was baked into what that number looks like. So, there is firm announcements underlying all that kind of 2 million tons. And that 2 million is based on, again, a pretty rigorous both economic and kind of environmental political view of what's going on in China.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And just as a follow-up. In the second half of the year, I think we're all aware there's some truck issues in Brazil. Are you hearing any reports of sort of the uncertainty around that causing any issues in terms of getting deliveries in country or just raising cost or changing economics? Any comments about that?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We have. I was in Brazil last month and I have my own kind of channel checks and conversations with the people I used to deal with. And it's caused us significant amount of angst, cost and disruption both on the product moving down the port and product moving up or fertilizer moving up into the market. So delays, again, costs and restructuring and that's still to settle out on what the decision point will be, on what changes within investment in logistical asset. So I do believe though, however that product will be delivered and they will exceed the tonnage that was shipped last year and consumed, but it's going to be hundreds of millions of dollars that will be wasted.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Oliver S. Rowe - Scotiabank","It's Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. So it sounds like once you pay back the next $500 million of debt, you'll be at your target leverage. Is it all buybacks from there or do you think there's still opportunities in nitrogen consolidation that you could take advantage of?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well I mean as we've talked about, I do think the industry is going to continue to go through waves of consolidation. It's one of the ways to drive efficiency into the supply chain, and at the end of the day that's good for all market participants including farmers. It's interesting that you asked that, because as we look at it, we are continuing to invest in what we view as the best fleet of nitrogen assets out there by virtue of our share repurchase program. And we think about it kind of as $1 billion of capital that's been allocated and half of that is going towards share repurchase and half of it's going towards the debt repayment. But as you say, once the 2020s are gone, we feel like we've gotten the balance sheet to a place that is efficient and sustainable. And so, we'll see what comes along. But right now, our best investment is in our own shares and we're excited about it. As Dennis mentioned, we closed the month of July with about $900 million of cash on the balance sheet and we feel like we're in a really good position to be able to go out and invest in our own shares.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And I think the other thing in that share repurchases to plan out to people on the credit side is that the shares come with roughly less right now of 3% yield, so all the shares that we do take up pursuant to a share repurchase program also have the effect of reducing fixed charges, increasing our funds flow. So I think the actions that we've talked about today, obviously reaffirming one and announcing other both of those things I think are credit positive.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Tony, if your shale gas advantage continues, why shouldn't we expect a second wave of urea or nitrogen plants similar to ethylene? I mean you are still a net importer of urea and should a low-cost region be a net importer?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean I think the issue really comes down to one of what is the economics associated with the cost of building a new plant and what is your expected return profile on that incremental capital that you're putting into play. And the analysis that we've done sort of suggests that $2 per MMBtu of cost advantage can cover about $250 million of CapEx, but what you see in North America is that because you cannot get LSTK lump sum contracts on the construction side, typically the cost to build in North America is well more than $250 million, and in some cases, it could be $400 million to $500 million to $600 million of incremental cost. And so at some level, even if gas is almost free, it's really hard to want to build new plants here because the labor cost is so high and so unpredictable.","And so our expectation is, like you see going on, Russia, Nigeria, Iran, places that you can much better control what your capital costs are and still have access to low cost gas, albeit you're biting off a fair bit of political risk, are the likely places where you're going to see capacity added going forward, but also I mean it's great to have assets here, but it's tough to want to build new ones. I think that's the way that I would think about it.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. I'll follow-up with you on that one offline.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Okay.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Secondly what are your expectations for Chinese exports in the second half? Do you see slightly more exports in the second half? And longer-term, do you think China will become a net importer of urea? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean I think for China to become a net importer is sort of in some ways more optimistic than what we are planning on. We think that China exporting somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 million tons to 2 million tons a year leaves on the very reliable and much healthier kind of internal industry and it also means that they're kind of self-sufficient. And so, I wouldn't expect exports in the back half of the year to look dramatically different than the front half of the year. I think what we're seeing kind of behavior out of China that's very consistent with the position that the central government has taken with respect to closing down excess capacity zombie industries, with respect to try and put some real teeth in terms of environmental regulation, and emissions reductions, and trying to have a sustainable and viable kind of coal industry and power industry. And I think all of those things are continued to be demonstrated by the actions that they're taking and there's nothing there that we've seen as being inconsistent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hey good morning. So as you've highlighted, energy prices definitely have supported higher cost curves and looking at what happened last year during the winter months, we saw LNG and your own nat gas prices spike up, which I think could potentially happen again this year. So we didn't see a cost curve that you published this quarter which is understandable given all the moving parts, but I'm just wondering what's your view on the cost curve range for urea prices this year and maybe what's the normalized price range given today's energy environment? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Andrew, we typically only do kind of one cost curve a year because as you point out, it's very much a moment in time view forward. And as currencies change, as oil and energy costs change, coal costs change, it moves all over the place and we would be forever publishing and then only to find that the day later it's out-of-date already, but as you said, or as we talked about, the higher energy deck (00:38:05) and in particular the higher forward curve going forward as we put forward on slide 13 in our materials sort of portend a much higher global cost curve.","And the way we think about the curve is that on kind of energy costs that we see around the globe, that somewhere in the kind of $250 million to $290 million range is pretty much what's required in order to keep the total capacity operating that the world is demanding.","And so the prices that are being exhibited today in terms of what India was able to close their tender at, which was pretty close to $275 million prices in NOLA, are all consistent with that. We think the world actually is operating in a pretty rational range right now vis-\u00e0-vis the cost curve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Nice quarter. I think the North American crop may mature a little bit early this year, which may give a little wider window for ammonia applications in the fall. Do you expect a larger than normal seasonal shift to ammonia this fall? And would that actually be a good mix shift for you?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We do expect the crop to come off. Both beans and corn are maturing early and that'll give extra time for field work and position ammonia application as early as late October if the weather and temperatures cooperate. And so on the value spread today that we project between fall and spring and what is available, I would expect that those who are focused on those issues, which should be every farmer, would be encouraged to apply fall application ammonia. So we're positive on that.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And the good news really, John, for us is we're well positioned to capitalize on a fall application run. And if weather doesn't cooperate from the standpoint of making it conducive to put it down, then we're well positioned to take advantage of the increased demand come spring. So we feel pretty good about our distribution network and the optionality that we have there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. You have this global nitrogen demand buildup chart on slide 12, that's very interesting. I'd like to hear your views on what you think is going on in China that has led to kind of a moderation or even a contraction in their demand. Do you think that is in the acreage shifting or more just prudent use of nitrogen there?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Go ahead.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think you're seeing a combination of both. I think what's happening in China is, you have to remember, 50% of their urea demand is used in fruits and vegetables, and it's a smaller percentage used in corn as in the United States. We're obviously heavily driven by corn, then wheat and cotton. And so in terms of demand, that's where I would expect you're seeing some drop off.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. And I do think, Steve, that there has been a real push towards being a little more efficient and appropriate in terms of application rates in China. And that's why, as we look forward in terms of what the aggregate demand profile looks like, it really is at the end of the day, being driven by a combination of global population increase. Protein consumption per capita is continuing to go up, particularly in parts of the developing world. And you've got global GDP that is really driving the industrial use.","So we feel very comfortable in terms of the sustainable and consistent demand growth that kind of underpins our view of what is driving the tightening on the S&D side of nitrogen. And it's borne out sort of over a pretty long time horizon here, that while there's a little bit of volatility, the numbers continue just to march forward.","Operator","Thank you.

Quick questions on hedges. As you guys \u2013 the hedges are running off. I'm just wondering if you're considering any further changes in your hedging strategy.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We're really pleased to be kind of spot buyers of North American natural gas. I think what's been demonstrated is, don't bet against the technology innovation of the people doing E&P.","And the fact that we're able to really take advantage particularly in some of the in-market basins, SCOOP\/STACK and the Permian and so forth is tremendous. So we're really comfortable in North America being kind of spot buyers.","I will say we do think about basis differentials off of Henry Hub. And once in a while, we'll take advantage of what we think is an appropriate basis differential, but that's not hedging the underlying molecules. It's just locking in the spread.","We may think about Europe as being in a little bit different quadrant than North America, because they are sort of chronically gas-short and there's much more volatility to the upside there.","And so, we've thought about at point in time, does it make sense to lock some of our European gas for the UK? The problem is the forward curve is pretty unattractive right now. And so we haven't done that, but I think philosophically, we're in the same spot relative to North America, which is it's great to be a buyer of North American gas.","Operator","Thank you.

LLC","First, with your commitment to safety I'm somewhat surprised to see slide 18, that ergonomic setup does not look safe to me, but you need to give him a higher chair.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We'll work on that. I think they're height adjustable. Maybe he just likes to sit well, but we'll work on that.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That said, I was wondering, we've seen the closure of the Kuwaiti plant earlier this month. We're expecting the Brazilian ones later this year. Are there possibilities of other plants outside of China closing like this on the gas availability? I would never have thought that that would be a reason to close the urea plant in 2018, but here we are. And as a follow-up on that, is there an opportunity for you guys to go in and buy those decommissioned plants for cheap and keep them on standby in case there is another up-cycle at some point in the distant future?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, Jonas, there are a couple of other plants that have had some real problems including the CFT2000 plant, (00:45:52) which Coke has a big position in, in Trinidad. They were offline for several months because they were \u2013 our inability to get appropriate gas contract with NGC in Trinidad. You've also seen while it's not directly in our business, but Proman also in Trinidad is taking down one of their methanol lines. And I think any of the Trinidadian operators that have gas contracts that are expiring are facing real problems in terms of being able to secure supply at a level that allows them to even make enough cash to conduct turnaround activities.","Our interest in terms of buying some of these real marginal plants that already have been capital starved in other parts of the world is pretty low. I'd rather take that cash and deploy it against share repurchases instead, but as we look around the world, there are other geographies that are really challenged. And again it's because they've been kind of starved in the plants of capital and running on fumes and the profitability is really tough and I'm including places like Croatia and Romania.","And I think the sanctions in Iran are creating some challenges too. So Siemens has closed their offices there and moved everybody out. Their ability to get technical expertise for commissioning or maintenance activities, availability of spare parts means that over time we would expect there to be, from an operating rate perspective, some real challenges there. So I think, again, just stepping back big picture, it really is helping to drive our optimism around the kind of the intermediate term here.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Jonas, what I would add to that is as we look around the world and think about opportunities, we think strategically about the source of supply for feedstock. And what we look at is, is the feedstock there? If it's not there, is the investment going in to put it there if it's missing. And if that investment is going in, what's the timing and development cost per MMBtu, what are the lifting costs and therefore what does that portend for a potential gas price into a facility? So we look at all those things and I would just echo what Tony said. It's really good. It's good to be us and good to be here.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And the one other thing that I'll point out is if you look at, on a global basis kind of announced turnarounds, this is a record summer for the amount of global capacity that's coming offline. And I think that also really helps support our view of the second half of 2018, which is just there's not going to be the material that's floating around out there and we see a very constructive price environment going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. This is Robin on for Joel. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that you expect higher number of turnarounds this year versus last. Can you give us an idea of how many turnarounds have already occurred in the first half? And maybe if you can break down a split for turnarounds in Q3 and Q4? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We typically don't give that information. And to be honest, I'm not going to start now. Our operating rate in the first half of the year was consistent with our production in the first half of last year and we did say we're having more turnarounds and those are really second half events. At the end of the day, we expect our aggregate production to be within about a couple of percentage points of where we were last year from the total tonnage standpoint. So we're not talking about huge numbers, but as we talked about in the first quarter, given the weather delayed application that was going on and the fact that first quarter volumes were low, we pretty much sell what we make and we run the plants 24\/7 365 to the extent that we can and that really came good in the second quarter.","So that's why we think about it as the first half results as opposed to just second quarter because you got to understand kind of what opportunity weather gave you in the first quarter versus not. And so, think about the second half of the year as being we're going to again pretty much try to sell what we make and we'll be within a couple of percent of aggregate volumes of last year.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","All right. Thanks. And just lastly, should we expect concurrent buybacks as the 2020s are repaid or will you wait until after that's done?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I don't know that I would necessarily think about those as being one for one concurrence. I think we're leaving ourselves some flexibility in terms of how we allocate it, but if we're \u2013 when we pay back the 2020s, there's a make-whole associated with them where we're effectively paying for the use of that money anyway. The difference between leaving them outstanding and paying them early is pretty trivial. So, given the fact that we're effectively paying for the use of that money, I'd rather take out shares because taking out the shares does, as Dennis mentioned, lower our fixed charges based on the dividend yield whereas paying the bonds early, that cash is going out the door in the form of the make-whole. So no, I would not expect it to be ratable one-for-one.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Charles Neivert from Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Neivert - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Just a quick question on the summer fill; the amount of tonnage you guys did into the fill programs for the fall, how much of the third quarter is sort of already taken care of and how much do you still have to sell, so to speak, in percentage terms or tonnage terms however you care to answer it. So, how much forward are you guys at this point?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So we generally don't give that information out in terms of our book and we're generally either positive or negative in terms of our communication. And so I'd just reiterate we believe the program was very positive. It went out at the price levels that we had targeted and we're able to position each plant in good shape in terms of logistically in what they're able to; one, operate; two, move; and three, then leverage our terminals. And so for each ammonia, urea and UAN, I think we're solid through Q3 and then we'll take a look at how we roll forward for the back half of the year and close out the year.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean Charlie, the other thing I'd say is, obviously if you look at where pricing is this year compared to last, it's well up and there was good appetite on the part of buyers, but Bert has been judicious in terms of the appropriate amount of book-to-bill that gives us a lot of operating flexibility and yet leaving us enough gas in the tank to take advantage of opportunities as the balance of the year develops. So we're really comfortable with kind of how all of that's been positioned and again that's part of what has driven our authorization to do the share buybacks beginning now just because we're feeling really comfortable about this year and the longer-term.","Operator","Thank you.

Do not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Steve Wilson, our Chairman and CEO.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last year, during our fourth quarter earnings call, I stated that we expected 2012 to be a great year, and it was. Looking at just about any metric, whether operational, financial or strategic, we generated exceptional results. We set full year records for sales volume, revenue, EBITDA, earnings and earnings per share. Using the flexibility of our production and distribution system, our employees made sure that our products were in the right place at the right time to meet our customer commitments. In meeting those commitments, we generated great results for shareholders.","Despite a heavier-than-average turnaround schedule that reduced our available production volume, we shipped record full year volume of 15 million tons in 2012. This record reflects the ingenuity and skill of our team who did a terrific job of managing our inventory. Capitalizing on the inherent advantages of our ammonia distribution system and the hard work of our team, we set a full year ammonia delivery record. Attractive nitrogen economics helped us obtain several financial records for the year. These included full year revenues of $6.1 billion, EBITDA of $3.3 billion, net earnings of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $28.59. We also generated record operating cash flow of $2.4 billion.","We returned a significant portion of that cash to our shareholders in the second quarter by completing the $1.5 billion share repurchase program we put in place in August 2011. We bought a total of 9.6 million shares under this program at an average price of $156.80 per share and completed it in less than one year. Cash generation capacity of our business gave us the confidence to make the bold strategic commitments we announced last year.","First, we entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 34% interest in CFL, the entity that holds our Medicine Hat Alberta Nitrogen Complex, for approximately CAD 900 million, and we're working our way through the regulatory approval process as we speak.","And our board authorized a new $3 billion share repurchase program, which extends through December 31, 2016. While we didn't repurchase any shares under the program during 2012, our track record of past execution of share repurchases support our commitment to this program.","And finally, we announced and are moving forward with $3.8 billion of capacity expansion projects in Louisiana and Iowa, which, upon completion, will increase our marketable nitrogen volume by more than 25% to 8.5 million nutrient tons by 2016. These actions are grounded in disciplined and rigorous analysis and represent smart choices that we believe will contribute to long-term shareholder value.","Yesterday afternoon, we announced our fourth quarter 2012 financial results, including record fourth quarter earnings of $471 million and EPS of $7.40 on total revenues of $1.5 billion.","Our Nitrogen segment generated very strong results last quarter, with adjusted gross margin at $750 million on adjusted sales of $1.4 billion. Sales volume of 3.3 million tons was a result of healthy demand for all nitrogen products, especially ammonia, and adjusted gross margin increased from last year, reflecting the benefit of low natural gas cost.","During the fourth quarter, we experienced strong ammonia demand across Iowa, Illinois and Indiana as weather alleviated moisture concerns there, and the dry conditions in Nebraska and Kansas did not have as much impact as expected. We dealt effectively with logistical challenges created by low water levels on the inland river system by capitalizing on our end market production points and our access to ammonia pipelines, river transportation and several rail systems. In doing so, we achieved quarterly delivery records at 6 of our 21 ammonia terminals.","We had low ammonia inventory levels throughout the quarter, even hitting an all-time low since the combination of CF Industries and Terra. And our low year-end ammonia inventory position reflected tight industry-wide supply, strong fall demand and gas curtailments that have impacted some offshore producers. Our adjusted average ammonia selling price was $640 per ton, 5% higher than a year ago.","Seasonal slowness characterized the fall urea market, although high Chinese export volumes weighed on global urea prices. We saw high-cost offshore producers, again demonstrate rational economic behavior in response to these prices. When prices reached what we believe are those producers' breakeven points, they shut down plants and took turnarounds, which helped balance the market. While our urea volumes increased slightly, our urea prices did decline to an average of $401 on an adjusted basis. But as we've communicated before, this is a price at which we still earn a very attractive margin.","UAN demand was very strong in the fourth quarter of 2011, which created a tough year-over-year comparison for us this past year. While our UAN prices and volume were lower in this year's fourth quarter, they were still at levels that reflect healthy demand. And I'm pleased with the way our UAN team performed this year as they have positioned us very well for what we believe will be a strong 2013.  The low price of natural gas enabled us to capitalize on our strong revenue performance to deliver another quarter of great earnings.","Thanks to the decline in our gas costs, our Nitrogen segment's adjusted gross margin increased from $742 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $750 million in 2012. The decline in natural gas costs attributed to the rapid growth in shale production has led to the advantaged cost position of North American nitrogen manufacturers and has sparked a renaissance in North American industrial activity.","Our Phosphate business generated fourth quarter gross profit of $36 million on sales of $256 million. Gross profit and sales were down from a year ago as the international phosphate market was weaker during this year's fourth quarter due to limited buying activity in South America and India. Adding to market weakness was a higher level of supply as phosphate producers operated at higher rates. While these factors contributed to a weaker pricing environment, we did see strong North American sales volume as farmers applied nutrients in preparation for the high number of acres expected to be planted in 2013, as I'll discuss later.","We're delighted with the successes we realized and the results we generated during 2012. Record financial results, exceptional operating performance and a tightly focused capital allocation strategy supported strong CF Industries stock price performance in 2012.","Dennis will now walk through more specifics of our financial results, and then I'll provide my thoughts on how we're positioned to make 2013 another successful year.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. For the full year 2012, CF Industries had net earnings of $1.8 billion on sales of $6.1 billion. Fully diluted earnings per share of $28.59 included noncash mark-to-market gains on natural gas and foreign currency derivatives, accelerated amortization of capitalized financing fees related to the termination of the company's prior credit facility and a gain from a reduction in employee postretirement benefits. Together, these items increased earnings per share by $0.67 for the year. EBITDA for 2012 was $3.3 billion.","Our fourth quarter net income of $471 million or $7.40 per share included mark-to-market gains of $13.1 million before taxes or $0.13 per share after tax. Our fully diluted earnings per share was a fourth quarter record, as illustrated by the red boxed bars on Slide 5.","As Steve noted, our Nitrogen business performed very well in the fourth quarter. Slide 7 shows that we had adjusted nitrogen sales of $1.4 billion, down from the fourth quarter of 2011 on volume that was about 2% lower. Segment adjusted gross margin of $750 million was 55% of sales, 3 percentage points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to lower natural gas costs.","Our average adjusted ammonia price per ton was up 5% year-over-year. Our average as-adjusted urea price per ton was down 6%, and our average UAN price per ton was down 13%.","The Nitrogen segment had sales volume of 3.3 million tons in the fourth quarter. Declines in UAN and AN were offset partially by increases in ammonia and urea. Ammonia sales volume was up due to strong demand and favorable weather conditions, and urea volume increased slightly over last year. UAN volume was down due to plant turnaround activities and the decision to shift production mix to increase higher-margin ammonia sales. And volume was down due to plant turnaround activities.","For the full year, the Nitrogen segment had gross margin of $2.9 billion compared to an adjusted $2.4 billion in the prior year. As a percent of sales, gross margin increased to 57% in 2012 from an adjusted 50% in 2011.","The Phosphate business had fourth quarter 2012 revenues of $256 million, which was essentially unchanged from last year. Sales volume of 509,000 tons increased 16% from 2011, which was offset partially by a 14% decline in the combined average selling price per DAP and MAP.","Domestic sales comprised 72% of our phosphate sales volume in the quarter. Phosphate segment gross margin was $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $79 million in 2011. The decline in margin was due to lower selling prices and higher phosphate production costs.","For the full year, the Phosphate segment generated $200 million of gross margin on sales of $1 billion compared to $332 million of gross margin on sales of $1.1 billion in 2011. The decline in gross margin and revenues was due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2012.","We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. With $2.3 billion of cash as of December 31, 2012, total debt-to-EBITDA of less than 0.5x and investment-grade credit ratings, we have ample liquidity and the ability to access the debt capital markets, if needed, to finance our strategic capital allocation priorities.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. As we move further into 2013, global agricultural market's nitrogen supply and demand dynamics and natural gas prices continue to provide reasons for us to be optimistic. Crop economics around the world support our expectations for a great 2013. Tight stocks-to-use ratios and the resulting high crop prices, especially for corn, are expected to cause farmers across North America, Europe, Ukraine and China to plant large acreage to grains. These planting expectations are driving strong global demand for nitrogen fertilizers. We expect the U.S. farmers to plant 97 million acres of corn. This should result in strong domestic demand for nitrogen in all its forms. We saw that demand reflected in ammonia shipments this past fall, and demand this spring should continue to support ammonia pricing. The Midwest ammonia market is expected to remain tight for the immediate future as inventories remain low.","Several factors are contributing to tight conditions in the UAN market. Overall, northern hemisphere demand for UAN is expected to be robust. Strong nitrates demand in Europe is limiting the flow of UAN exports to North America. Domestic production has been lower than in recent years due to turnaround activity and unplanned outages. Additionally, the startup of 2 expansion projects from which buyers were expecting to obtain UAN have been delayed. Limited imports, lower production rates and low inventories lead us to believe that the North American market for UAN will be tight during the first half of 2013.","As spring urea demand emerges, we expect to see favorable pricing conditions develop, especially as we move into the second quarter. Domestic production was off about 15% this fall, and despite higher imports, inventories are below year-ago levels. The tight supply of ammonia and UAN also suggests a strengthening in the domestic urea market as we move through spring.","Overall, the global nitrogen market is expected to be in a balanced to tight position through the first half of 2013, given strong demand and limited supply due to the delays in new capacity coming online and gas curtailments impacting nitrogen production in several countries. Although the phosphate market has been seasonally weak this winter, we expect it to improve as the spring demand picks up in North America and as India works through its current phosphate inventories and returns to the market. Additionally, a continuation of high soybean prices should support a large planting in South America and create additional phosphate demand later in the first half of the year.","We realize a significant and sustainable advantage as a consumer of North American natural gas. Natural gas availability is far from assured in many regions of the world as we've seen gas curtailments impact several offshore nitrogen producers. We have hedged about 90% of the gas needed for our anticipated nitrogen production needs through April, and most of those hedges are call options that have our cost capped at well below $4 per MMBtu.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has been very responsive and active in keeping the Mississippi River open for barge traffic. We appreciate their attention to this critical national resource. However, we have taken steps to be prepared if system conditions deteriorate again. We've analyzed various scenarios and positioned our rail fleet to be able to respond to changing logistical conditions. No other producer or importer has the optionality that we have, including in-market plant locations, multiple storage sites and access to transportation, including rail, truck, barge and pipelines. Our customers recognize our dependability, and we will continue to earn their trust by delivering our products on time where they are needed.","We're off to a fast start on our capacity expansion projects. I'm pleased to report that we have applied for our air permits in both Louisiana and Iowa. And as of February 15, a total of $480 million has been spent on or committed to these 2 projects. For all of 2013, we expect to invest between $1 billion and $1.3 billion on capital expenditures for these projects in addition to the $450 million we expect to spend on normal maintenance and existing plant investments. We'll provide updates on these projects as we reach other key milestones.","We have a well-established track record of achieving our strategic objectives, and I believe that track record has been a key driver of the value we've been able to create for shareholders. We are confident in the strength of our business model and look forward to continuing to invest in the business in the years to come in order to create even more value for our shareholders.","With that, we'll now open the line to answer your questions. Tony, would you help us with that, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Steve, a question on capital allocation. I know you've stated in the past that you don't want to go to the MLP route or even expand the Terra Nitrogen partnership by adding a plant or 2. But I noticed that many of your peers have moved away from the former 1% yield cap that appeared to exist in the fertilizer sector, and yet many of them have significant capital expenditure plans as well. So I guess with nitrogen having probably the best outlook of the 3 nutrients, any plans to move your dividend yield on a recurring basis beyond the 76 basis points? And how do you think of the ongoing dividend yield in terms of return of capital to shareholders?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we look at our capital structure on a regular basis, and we do it systematically in discussions with our board, at least, annually. And I'm frankly very proud of our track record in this regard. We've bought a total of $2 billion worth of our stock back in a couple of programs. We have, I think, once quintupled our dividend and, again, quadrupled it. But frankly, I think a nitrogen fertilizer stock is never going to be a yield stock. We came to the conclusion last summer that -- and some of those results from talking to shareholders that buying shares back is the best way for us to return cash to shareholders. We have a $3 billion program in place, and we're very comfortable to have that in place, and we look forward to future reports on progress against that.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","One follow-up, Steve, and that's on -- just how you see the spring unfolding. We've got an ongoing drought here. Do you think that causes a shift from ammonia application to UAN? Is that one of the reasons why you're so positive on the UAN outlook this spring?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert, would you handle that one, please?","Bert A. Frost","Sure. Regarding the drought, it's correct. There has been a shortage of moisture throughout the Midwest. But if you look at the average moisture from February through April that we should be receiving, the one state that would be negative on a percent of normal precipitation would be Nebraska, at about 120% to 130% needed to get back to normal. The other states, the I states, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, not an I state, but are actually net positive. Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas need about 80% of normal to get back to a sustainable moisture basis. So when you look at that situation across the board, it's fairly positive, Nebraska being a pivot state, so we think that will go well towards ammonia. But your second point on UAN, that is why we're positive. Because with inventory levels being low, demand being high, the net fallback to UAN should be very positive. But inventories are low for all products, except for the importation of urea, and so we believe the fallback product for N will be urea, and we need the imports that have come in to date. So for that reason, we're net positive, all the end products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, could you talk a little bit about sort of the forward order books to the extent that you're comfortable with that? I guess what I'm asking is just at this time last year, you mentioned that because of the sort of turmoil in the fourth quarter, you guys have sort of actively chosen to sell a lot less forward than normal. Can you give us a sense of where we are, at least relative to last year, and then any other general comment you can make about it?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, relative to last year, I think we're in a solid position on all the end products. And the previous question, UAN is high-demand, and for the reasons we articulated earlier in the call, the pricing will be positive through June for this current crop year. And our order book is -- we're pleased with where we are. We see demand for each of the products, some regionally greater than others, but we are positioning our products today to achieve similar or greater levels of demand through June.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, a question on your pending projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. I was wondering if you can give us a sense for the mileposts coming up in future quarters? I think you mentioned you had applied for air permits. Perhaps you could shed some light on how long that might take and when we might break ground and what the capital budgets are looking like in terms of E&C cost trends and that sort of thing for each of your key projects here?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we're very pleased with where we are. We have great momentum. We have 2 good teams put together. We have, actually, a team that's living in Germany to make sure that we get all the engineering stuff done right. We have filed for the 2 air permits. Those are very important gating items that are really necessary before we can start major construction activity. We're hopeful that we will be able to begin to move dirt and drive pile sometime this summer. But certainly, we don't control both ends of that process. We only control the submission and then the response to questions that comes along with that. With respect to the situation on equipment orders and so forth, I'll have Tony go through just a snapshot of what sorts of things are on order.","W. Anthony Will","Yes. So we've ordered the rotating equipment and most of the high-pressure equipment for the both ammonia plants, both urea plants and the nitric acid plant. I think we've spent, as Steve mentioned, about $480 million all told thus far.","Stephen R. Wilson","Spending and committed.","W. Anthony Will","Spending and committed. And we're expecting to spend somewhere in the range of about $1 billion to $1.3 billion in total through the balance of this year.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up question, you referred, Steve, in your prepared remarks to some of the curtailments of natural gas supply that are occurring in other markets. And I was wondering if you could give us an update on your thoughts there and how things have changed in Egypt and how long we might likely see curtailments in Trinidad impacts on the supply side of the global equation.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, in terms of what's going on in North Africa, I think probably, everybody on the call has equal knowledge. There's turmoil and disruptions caused by political issues and some physical issues, and they don't seem to have been resolved. There's an ongoing issue in Pakistan with limitations on gas supply. With respect to Trinidad, there've been comments made by the national gas company that they have solved their supply problem and will be back to what used to be normal. We have to wait and see whether that's actually going to happen. With respect to our own situation, while we like our Trinidad operation and it's a significant supply source, the most significant supply source for our phosphate operation, all of this makes us increasingly comfortable with our North American footprint, the number of locations that we have and the decisions that we've made to expand production in North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When do you expect the CFL acquisition to close, and what are the remaining impediments?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay, Jeff, if we go back to when we made the announcement, I think we listed a few major mileposts, and we've passed maybe 1 or 2 of those. The first one was Glencore getting regulatory approval to close on their purchase of Viterra, and they were waiting for the Chinese to give the go ahead. They got that go ahead. And then the second item was the closing of that transaction. That occurred in mid-December. So while we had done our filings with the regulators in Canada, realistically, they were waiting for that precedent transaction to be completed. And now that it's been completed, they're focused on our filing with the Competition Bureau and the Investment Canada Organization. We have a good dialogue with them between our representatives and their representatives, and we're hopeful that we can get the clearance in the near future. But again, this is a situation of which we only can control one side. We are prepared to close expeditiously once we get that go ahead, and we certainly look forward to having all of CFL in our portfolio. It will simplify our operation and -- not just from the operating standpoint but also from the governance standpoint.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","If I may follow up, are there any key dates where the governmental agencies are required to inform you of a decision of theirs by a particular time, or are there any key dates for your own filings?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I understand the question, and I think I'm not a lawyer, but I believe technically, there are dates, but practically, they end up being extended in a way by mutual agreement of the parties because it's certainly in our interest to have a favorable outcome as opposed to meet or force them to comply with an arbitrary deadline. But we're in constant conversations, and we're hopeful we'll get results soon. But there is no specific deadline looming for this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Picken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to touch base a little bit on kind of your outlook for some of the other parts of the U.S. and specifically, kind of the Southern Plains, Texas, Oklahoma area. I mean, how big of a market is that for you guys if the drought in that area persists, understanding that they did get a little bit of rain recently?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Texas and Oklahoma, for corn, represent roughly 3% of the United States corn but a significant percentage of wheat and cotton. That market -- those markets starting in Southern Texas have already started with planting, and so we expect urea and UAN to be going down soon. They had a very favorable fall. The wheat dormancy should be coming out -- or coming out of dormancy soon, let's say, March, and so you'll see a top-dress application starting in late February to March. Generally, as the Southwest goes, then it progresses up through the Midwest on applications. We're anticipating a favorable application season, due to what you just said, is the moisture level that has been received. But coupled with that is the Southeast, which had higher levels of cotton and peanuts last year, which we anticipate moving more to corn, so being an additional demand on N early in the season, which should be positive for the United States.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, I just wanted to kind of ask, I mean, are those markets material at all for phosphate? And my understanding is they're heavier in nitrogen than phosphate.","Bert A. Frost","For us, we're seeing -- focusing on nitrogen. Yes, we are seeing them be positive for CF. The movement of product to those directions, which are not traditional markets for CF, have been greater than in the past. For that reason, you've seen us ramp up our usage of our tanks on the East Coast, as well as staffing in that area. For phosphates, we traditionally supply products in that area on an FOB basis, but we ship more out by rail and barge to the Midwest. There are other suppliers that are situated better to serve the phosphate market on the East Coast. The P market in general, we've had a lot of questions on that. We see that moving in the positive direction. We're seeing that already take place with pricing in NOLA. But the international markets, as the South American market takes off, we anticipate that to come early due to logistical constraints they experienced in 2012 and the need to replace the stocks that have been depleted. That market will probably kick off earlier. And then obviously, India with the negotiations that go on with the other market leaders, we anticipate that also to be a positive market.","Operator","Your next call comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays.","Matthew Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to ask what the main factor was driving the increase in costs on the Phosphate division over the quarter, whether there was a jump in cost to Hardee or anything else and whether that's going to normalize more going forward.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, it's largely driven by increase in ammonia price -- ammonia costs. Gulf ammonia, as you know, has been high-priced. It's come down some since the fourth quarter, but that was the main driver of that cost increase. And as far as the predictability of that, who knows? Overall, we love high ammonia prices because we sell a lot of ammonia.","Matthew Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And just following up there, do you have any significant natural gas hedges beyond April this year?","Stephen R. Wilson","As of the end of the year, we had a -- go ahead.","Dennis P. Kelleher","At the end of the year, we had, just like Steve said in the text, we had 90% of our gas usage covered with hedges through the end of April. As we look out beyond April, we have very, very tiny amount of swaps, so essentially, in no material sense do we -- the answer is essentially no.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson of Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Steve, you talked about good expectations for urea in the first half of the year. Can you just go one step further? And I know it's quite far out there, but just talk about how you see the supply-demand dynamic playing out in the back half of the year, specifically with respect to new capacity in the Middle East, as well as with Chinese exports.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I think if you went back and you looked at our results releases for the fourth quarter, probably in every year since we've been public, we are loathe to comment on the second half of any upcoming year. And the reason for that is that we haven't even started the spring yet. We don't know what the weather patterns are going to be. We don't know which products are going to be in demand. And most importantly, we don't have a good way of projecting what the end of the season inventories will be product by product by product. So the second half of the year is driven in large part by what the inventory positions are coming out of the planting season and, of course, the expectations going forward. And so the quality of the crop that's in the ground, the projected yield, the economics for farmers for 2014, all of those things have impacts on the second half of the year. And we have a tough enough time trying to figure out what's going to happen in the next 4 or 5 months as opposed to the next 10 to 12 months. With respect to capacity coming on in other parts of the world, 2012, I think, was a good demonstration of how difficult it is to bring on new capacity, certainly, in some parts of the world. A number of projects that were penciled in by industry observers as coming on in 2012 were deferred into 2013. There's obviously a high likelihood that those projects will be completed. But I think then you have to look at what's the probability is of originally scheduled 2013 startups actually occurring in 2013 or whether some of those projects get deferred into 2014. Overall, looking at the last several years, I think that the market has demonstrated quite a good capacity for absorbing the output of these new projects. The market has stayed in pretty good shape overall despite the ups and downs in Chinese exports, despite the lumpiness of new capacity coming on. And we're very pleased with the long-term outlook, and that's why we're making the investments that we're making.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Steve, I wonder if we could switch to MAP and DAP. It looks to me like your inventory levels might be low relative to the industry. I'm not sure if that's right. Just curious how you think the U.S. MAP and DAP is shaping up for the spring. And if India doesn't get its act together, what would you see as the domestic market outlook, assuming that we don't see the export market come back very quickly?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","We maintained a low inventory level throughout 2012, and most likely, we'll continue to do so, marketing our product on a regular basis. Regarding India, India has been a big consumer of world phosphate, and their moderating levels of subsidy support, what that will be this year is still unclear. But we expect that to be settled sooner rather than later due to the fact that they just need to get product moving on a regular basis, both -- I'd say all 3 products, N, P and K. And so the phosphate market, as I said earlier, should continue to improve over time because of the dynamics of South America, India, as well as improving agricultural dynamics in the former Soviet Union. And I think for the United States market, the reason why you're seeing us be successful and continue to market on a regular basis is the lack of consignment on CF's position.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew O'Conor of BMO Asset Management.","Andrew O'Conor","With the amount of CapEx planned to be spent on expansion in 2013, $1 billion to $1.3 billion, what percent of project completion do you guys expect by year-end 2013 for Donaldsonville and Port Neal?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we spent about $120 million in 2012. You add that to the $1 billion to $1.3 billion and subtract the sum from $3.8 billion, and that's what you get for what's left. Now it looks like -- I haven't done the math. It looks like 35%, 40%, something like that.","Andrew O'Conor","Okay. And then, Steve, would you say that the capital expenditures are being spent any faster than was originally envisioned or that somehow some monies originally intended to be spent in 2014 are now being spent this year, 2013?","Stephen R. Wilson","We're on a very aggressive timetable. We want to bring these projects online as quickly as we can. So the extent to which we find equipment pricing that we like, we lock it up, we'll put money down. The extent to which we can get other parts of this project tied down, we will be -- we're not looking to spend money fast just to spend it fast, but we want the commitments in place, we want the timetable to be assured, and we want our costs to be under control. So we're being prudently aggressive, put it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","A couple of questions. There's been a lot of debates recently about residual nitrogen levels in the soil, but I've also heard a lot anecdotal evidence, a lot of anecdotal data points to say that a lot of farmers, more on the northern side in the states, are going to actually increase usage rates. Maybe you can talk about that part of the discussion, please?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Regarding the residual nitrogen, we just don't see that. We anticipate full utilization of nitrogen in 2013 and beyond. And then in the northern tier, that is taking place, so we see that almost done on an annual basis, the continued demand increase in North Dakota. As you look at the heat map for corn and where corn has gone over the last 20 years and taken over wheat area, you're just having a net increase, one, because of crop change but, two, because of yield potential in these areas and the change in seed technology has necessitated an increase in nitrogen. That being said, we're very positive on the northern territory, as well as Canada, going into 2013 due to the lack of applications that took place in the fall of 2012. So that will be a net pick-up for us in the spring. So we're encouraged by the total demand, as well as the forward demand for nitrogen in the northern tier.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Finally, maybe I'll go a bit to the left field, which is obviously your KEYTRADE investments. And Dennis and Steve, you're on KEYTRADE board. KEYTRADE announced something earlier this week with the polyhalite junior developments in England, Sirius Minerals signing an MOU if that company can raise $1 billion to build that mine. I wanted to -- maybe if you can talk about the opportunity in polyhalite. Is this just a risk-free MOU? And have you had some experience with ICL, which is mining a bit of polyhalite right now on a trial basis out of a mine, existing mine right near there that led you to have some confidence in this?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, we're very excited about what is taking place with KEYTRADE. There's a number of initiatives that they are participating in. They're net positive to KEYTRADE as well as to CF. It gives us a viewpoint into the different markets, different products, different relationships, and so you can see the leverage ability that we have with KEYTRADE. Not only is it a great relationship within the company, but they have tremendous relationships in the world, and this is just an example of that, that they would be viewed as a trusted marketer of products to many different companies. Regarding that product, we have met with the company just like we've met with many different companies on opportunities for investments and new mines or new production assets around the world and through that relationship, pass it on to our friends at KEYTRADE. And so it is another opportunity for specific fertilizer products? That's what they're investigating. They're spending the time and the resources to develop new markets. It does have a K component as well as an S component and some trace elements that are net positive to many different markets around the world. But it's more of a specialty product than a bulk product that will be utilized worldwide.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Has KEYTRADE been selling some of the polyhalite or using it, some of it through ICL's existing operation?","Bert A. Frost","At this point, KEYTRADE is beginning a relationship with the Sirius people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just very quickly, you mentioned domestic nitrogen demand in the Ukraine several times in your release. Can you just comment on any potential effects this may have on the global market, particularly if exports in North Africa continue to have issues?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, what we're seeing is an increase in AN, which is having a positive impact on the producers of UAN, AN and urea in that market. And so as you see a progression and a growth and a maturing of the Ukrainian agricultural market, you're seeing a parallel increase in demand in fertilizer. We see this as a net benefit to the market, and that has been translated into a decrease in UAN supply to the United States. Relative to AN for North Africa, you do see a greater degree of ammonium nitrate used in Northern Africa for fertilizer as well as for production of phosphate or N-P-K products. And so those are both benefits. As that demand increases, that consumes the supply out of that region.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a real quick follow-up. You touched on this a little bit, but can you just run through what you've seen in the phosphate market, particularly in the Americas, over the last few weeks and if you see any positive developments there?","Stephen R. Wilson","Yes, in the Americas, Brazil has just coming out of their Carnival holiday season, and they're in the heat of the harvest of soybeans and planting the second-crop corn. Argentina is also beginning their harvest process. So the focus now is on that. That being said, they've had a draining or a decreasing of inventory for all products, and we think they will reposition earlier than normal because of the logistical constraints that they experienced, this year with the merged cost being higher than the probably net profitability per ton. And it's also being expressed right now in the difficult to export their agricultural products that are processed or harvested. And so we see South America, specifically Brazil and Argentina, anticipating their purchases, and then Mexico, South America and that region continuing on a normal basis.","Dan Swenson","Tony, we're going to end our Q&A with that question, and at this point in time, I'm going to hand the call over to Steve Wilson to make some closing remarks.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dan. I just like to put the last 2 years into a bit of perspective. 2011 and 2012 put together, we had revenues of $12.2 billion. And on that $12.2 billion, we earned EBITDA of $6.3 billion. That's, to me, a testament of the earnings power of this company. Certainly, the 2012 experience begins to build evidence for the sustainability of our business model. The shale gas revolution has obviously provided us with a cost profile that is extremely competitive on the world stage. So we are very comfortable with our strategic position. We're very comfortable with the investments that we're making, and we're comfortable with our whole capital deployment strategy. It's a great time to be in the nitrogen business, and it's an even greater time to be CF Industries. So thanks to all of you, again, for participating on the call. If there's anything more you'd like to learn about the company, Dan's open for business. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation.

My name is Amanda, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin Jarosick","Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries first half and second quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President of Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its first half and second quarter 2019 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session.","Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","Also, you'll find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","Anthony Will","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the first half of 2019 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $936 million after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","Adjusted EBITDA increased to 23% over the first half of 2018 and 63% over 2017. Meanwhile, sales volumes have remained constant at $9.8 million product tons in each of the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Weather impacts significantly the timing of fertilizer applications often forcing shipments out of one quarter and into another, but sales volumes have remained constant over the first halves of the years.","This really demonstrates the uniqueness and power of the CF Industries business model. That despite the most extreme weather on record and uncertainty and shifting of planted acres by crop type, our first half sales volume has been steady through the past three years ever since our capacity expansion project started up at the end of 2016.","North America has some of the best, most productive farmland in the world and it will be planted each year if at all possible, even in the year like this one. As it is planted, it requires nitrogen fertilizer. The only nondiscretionary nutrient. This year also demonstrates why quarterly comparisons year-over-year are less meaningful than the compensability of first half results as quarterly volume is impacted by weather, but the first half volume remains constant.","Our terrific results were driven by two factors; higher year-over-year nitrogen prices and outstanding execution by the CF team. Nitrogen price increases were underpinned by a tightening global supply demand balance. We also benefited from higher than normal in-region premiums due to weather-related logistical issues that limited product supplied to some inland locations. Meanwhile, the CF team and network performed exceptionally well during the first half. We set an all time record for ammonia production. ","We took advantage of our system's flexibility to favor higher margin urea production over UAN, leading the all time records urea production and shipments, and we leveraged our distribution terminals and our logistical capabilities to reliably deliver for customers.","Most importantly, we continued to work safely. Our 12-month rolling recordable incident rate remained at 0.6 incidents per 200,000 work hours, despite the high level of activity that included a record 5.7 million product ton shipped during the second quarter. As we have stated, we believe that we will generate superior free cash flow through the cycle compared to most of our global competitors.","As shown on Slides 6 and 7 of our deck, over the last 12 months, our free cash flow was the industries best at nearly $1 billion. It is clear that not all EBITDA is created equal. Many of our competitors cash from operations is consumed back into their business to keep the lights on in the plants running. While we convert a significantly higher percentage of ours into available free cash flow.","This efficiency of EBITDA conversion into free cash means that although most industry participants\u2019 equity is valued within a similar band of trading multiples of EBITDA, investors in CF Industries are rewarded with significantly higher free cash flow yield than for any of the other industry competitors. Why is that important? Because we use that industry best free cash to increase shareholder accretion in our business as measured by tons of nitrogen capacity per 100,000 shares.","As seen on Slides 9 and 10, over the last 24 months, we have driven approximately 9% accretion for shareholders by investing in attractive growth, returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and we were also able to significantly reduce our outstanding debt levels at the same time.","We believe that we are well positioned to build on this track record over the next several years. As Bert will describe in more detail, there are a number of factors supporting our positive outlook. First, we expect strong nitrogen demand in North America over the next two years, as farmer economics strongly instant corn plantings.","Second, the forward curve for North American natural gas remains a very attractive compared to the rest of the world. This will continue to provide CF Industries, a significant cost advantage, keeping us on the lower end of the global cost curve.","And third, we expect global demand growth for nitrogen to outpace net capacity additions over the next four years, further tightening the global supply demand balance. Because of these three critical drivers, we see tremendous opportunities ahead for us that will continue to support our generation of substantial free cash flow.","With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will talk more about how we deliver these strong results in our outlook for the next few years. Then Dennis will cover the financial items before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert Frost","Thanks, Tony. The first half of 2019 demonstrated the tremendous flexibility of our manufacturing and distribution system and the skill of CF's people. We showed 9.8 million tons in the first half, including a Company record, 5.7 million tons in the second quarter, achieved higher prices compared to year-ago, and ensured our customers receive product when and where they needed it.","We're very proud of this performance given an extremely challenging spring application season, historic flooding, disruptive planting, applications in rail and barge transportation in many parts of the United States.","Our focus under these conditions was to be a reliable supplier to our customers. We did this in three ways. First, we had strong production at our facilities, including shifting our production mix to favor urea over UAN to capture higher margin opportunities.","We also benefited from having inland production sites given the transportation challenges. Our Port Neal, Iowa still they ran very well, which enabled record urea shipments that achieved higher \u2013 are the normal premiums to prices in New Orleans.","Second, we've positioned product well at our distribution terminals in advance of the spring season. This was critical to our ability to ship 1.2 million tons of ammonia, a quarterly record for the company, despite a limited window for application.","Third, we put our transportation flexibility to full use to overcome river closures during the flooding. We put your extra railcars that enabled us to rail a significant volume of urea from our Donaldsonville Louisiana facility to Minnesota, in order to capture higher margins.","We also secured additional barges that allowed us to focus on river terminals along the Ohio River, which remained open through spring. Additionally, we had record levels of truck shipments. All this activity continues through July as nutrient applications went much later than normal across the United States. This is why we didn't launch our UAN fill program until earlier this week, the latest we have ever done, so.","As you look ahead, we believe that industry fundamentals are very favorable over the next several years. We expect farmers to have a strong price incentive to increase corn planting significantly in the United States over the next several years. We believe that the U.S. will have around 85 million planted corn acres this year, much lower than anticipated heading into 2019. Additionally, late planting will lead to lower yields.","As a result, we expect ending corn stocks to be at their lowest levels since 2013. It should take several years of higher corn acres to return to normal ending corn stock. Forward cures for North American natural gas continue to be extremely favorable compared to 2018 and to the rest of the world.","Natural gas production in the U.S. average the record 88 Bcf per day during the second quarter, which is almost a 10% increase over the second quarter of 2018, supporting continued low natural gas prices in the region. With Henry Hub forward price curves averaging well below $3 per MMBtu through to 2025. We expect our production cost advantage to remain robust for the foreseeable future.","Globally, we anticipate continued strong demand for urea in Brazil and India. We also continue to expect that global demand growth will be above net capacity additions over the next four years given the limited number of projects currently under construction including none in North America.","The flexibility we built into the CF system served us and our customers well during a challenging spring season. We're looking forward to the rest of the year continuing to work with our customers and preparing for the strong demand we expect in the years ahead.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks, Bert. In the first half of 2019, the Company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $373 million or $1.67 per diluted share. EBITDA was $973 million and adjusted EBITDA was $936 million. There are two items affecting our first half results that I want to highlight. Our net earnings include an after tax gain of $35 million recognized during the second quarter on the sale of the Company's Pine Bend dry bulk storage facility in Minnesota.","Our net earnings also include a previously announced net incentive tax credit of $30 million recognized in the first quarter. During the first half net cash provided by operating activities was $693 million and free cash flow was $453 million. We repurchased about 4.2 million shares for approximately $178 million under our current $1 billion share repurchase program. We also distributed $133 million in dividend payments.","Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter or $858 million. Since the end of 2018, we've added $176 million of cash to the balance sheet even as we have returned $311 million shareholders to share repurchases and dividends. This demonstrates CF free cash flow power as Tony described earlier.","Our strong cash generation has provided us the flexibility to repay $500 million in debt on or before its maturity in May of 2020. It also allowed us to deploy excess cash in line with our longstanding capital allocation philosophy that is to pursue growth within our strategic fairway and in the absence of those opportunities to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Capital expenditures for the first half of 2019 we're $154 million. For the year, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million to $450 million. As we noted in the press release, we expect ammonia production in the third quarter to be somewhat lower than the first and second quarters as we enter the heaviest period of planned maintenance for the year.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks, before we open the call to Q&A.","Anthony Will","Thanks Dennis. Before we move onto your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work in the first half of 2019. They'd put all of the capabilities we've talked about for years into action to enable us to deliver for our customers and to generate strong financial results. Most importantly, they operated safely. I also want to recognize the team that are Ince UK facility who won the Stephen R. Wilson Excellence in Safety Award for their innovation that protects people and equipment while servicing high voltage switch gear.","As I close, I want to offer for a special thank you to Dennis Kelleher on his final earnings call with us. As you know, Dennis is retiring from CF on September 1 after eight successful years is our Chief Financial Officer. Dennis has been a tremendous leader in our Company and an invaluable partner to me and to our whole senior team.","As the scale and complexity of our business has grown. He's played a pivotal role in all of our significant initiatives. Our major capacity expansions, our capital return program, our M&A transactions, our balance sheet management and navigating some of the most challenging nitrogen industry conditions in over a decade. We will miss him and wish him continued success. Dennis? Thank you.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks Tony. Appreciated.","Anthony Will","As we announced, Chris Bohn will be appointed as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Chris is very familiar to many of you having led our Manufacturing and Distribution group for the last three years, in addition to holding other senior roles in the Company since joining CF in 2009. Chris brings deep knowledge of CF in the marketplace to the role and will provide continued strategic leadership as we capitalize on our future opportunities. Chris and Dennis had been working closely together the past several months and we expect a seamless transition.","CF\u2019s future is bright. Our unique and powerful business model has enabled us to generate and return to shareholders nearly $1 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months. With our structural and operational advantages along with the favorable industry fundamentals we see ahead, we are well positioned to drive substantial cash generation and long-term shareholder value creation in the years ahead.","With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Anthony Will","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson","So I guess Bert, Tony, Dennis just interested for us the market dynamics as we come out of spring and what did this quarter in spring kind of has shown about the U.S. marketplace? Thinking about the premium that urea has kind of captured to UAN specifically, you obviously shifted the production pretty sharply towards urea, but still with UAN and some of the more limited export opportunities.","How do you see that marketplace evolving over the next 12 to 24 months? Do you just see things rebalancing is people who can flex to urea and the nitrate premium returning just seems unusual for that to trade at such a sharp discount on a nutrient ton basis for a prolonged period of time?","Bert Frost","Yes. It's interesting you've pointed out the market dynamics and what we've seen over the last several years are those dynamics in play. And again back to the creativity and the flexibility of the CF system. We've seen heavy springs where we have \u2013 and falls, where we find a lot of ammonia and the past fertilizer year being the fall to spring limited ammonia, and what was going to happen, how were those end tons going to make it to the ground.","And so when you look at what we've done and what the market has done, when we look to future dynamics, what has shifted these tons has been more weather driven, not necessarily agronomic decision making driven. And so we're seeing small shifts over time, urea to UAN, UAN to urea.","But when they can apply the products, they choose the product that is economically or system advantageous for that producer. And so that's where you see the balance that we have in our system with all the products that we make, all the markets that we have access to, all the rail lines, pipelines is very good for us. Specifically focusing on UAN and why it is trading at a discount today and it is.","As I think the reflection of the EU antidumping duties that is forced additional Russian tons to come to the United States. And during the indecision time, probably additional Trinidadian tons to come to the United States. And as well as CF, we have focused on building out a greater access to the North American market for CF and that has happened. So we have repatriated more tons to the coastal regions as well as additional tank spacing that we thought would be good for our system where we had holes.","And then, I think what you're going to see over time is as the Trinidadians have a lower penalty rate, we'll probably focus more of their tons to the EU and then we'll see what happens with the market overall. We'll still be active in South America and some of these other areas that we're developing. So I think right now it's natural that UAN would trade at a discount to urea.","I think over time as it balances, we'll come back and we anticipate UAN to trade at a parody or even a premium. And the interior spreads that you mentioned, this is something we have articulated year-after-year that we believed that that was something that was structural to the United States and achievable as well as maintainable. And this year we prove that in states, where these expansions just went way out and we profited from that.","Anthony Will","And Adam I'd add to that, kind of what Bert was saying. I think one of the things that the EU antidumping duties did is that, it led to some globally inefficient behavior. So you've got a set of EU producers that are basically running full that on a purely economic basis. I've thought been shutdown, where at least largely curtailed. So that the lower cost Russian and Trinidadian tons and even our tons, could of back filled in about marketplace.","But the sort of the real kind of irony, I guess on all of this is \u2013 what you've seen is UAN prices to the European farmers. In particular, the French, farmers has gone through the rough and UAN pricing and the rest of the world has been relatively maintained.","And so what Brussels really did is put a huge tax on the European farmers and turn it around and given it to the inefficient European producers, some of which around, ironically by Russian entities.","So that kind of taxed the French farmers and funneled the money back into the Russian oligarchs\u2019 pocket. So it's kind of a weird twist of the way that worked. But as Bert said, we've got a lot of different levers to pull and we're navigating it as best as possible.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning, team. A question about ammonia, I think that the feeling was \u2013 I think a milling inventories there are higher in the country. And so I think the play was to be exploring a lot of ammonia in June into July and August, I guess exports lower netback, your a million netbacks were incredible in the quarter Q2 because of the Midwest and then premiums. How should we think about that export dynamic? How you're dealing with it and sort of the convergence of maybe some lagging MN premiums, but also having to export at lower net back? Thanks.","Anthony Will","So we look at ammonia, we look at a balanced portfolio always. And so we're constantly focused on the highest netback, which is our ag business. And you see that that we did very well and the team executed extremely well.","Part of that is in the preparation of where we placed the tons and utilizing our terminals and our logistical capabilities. Part of that was \u2013 Chris, and the plant's running extremely well. And so we were prepared, I'm not sure if our other market participants were as prepared as we were.","And so we did execute and did achieve very good netbacks. But look there is a system when you look at the total consumption of ammonia per year on a fertilizer year, fall to spring. It's around 4 million to 4.4 million tons of ammonia. And from fall, we knew that number was low. And now we expect that the spring number was also lower than normal. So there is less or there was less ammonia consumed.","And so of all of our systems, that's the inventory \u2013 that's higher than normal, but manageable. And we believe we executed extremely well based on that industrial export ag, and then spot sales during the quarter positioned us to get to fall and then participate in that ammonia season, and capitalize on it.","We will be exporting. We have export. We export it more on a year-to-date basis than last year. And like you said, that's to be expected, but I don't see that significantly higher and so premiums are good, market is good and we expect good things for this fall.","Dennis Kelleher","I mean, I think the other thing I'd add to that, Joel, as Bert said, because the ammonia system ran so well and we set an all time production record in the first half. We're really pleased with the volumes that that burden the team got down on the ground from ag perspective because ammonia still represented a great value to farmers compared to the on a nutrient basis compared to ammonia, or UAN and in Urea.","But historically Q3 is always our lowest volume and typically lowest price quarter for ammonia. And then when you get back into the application season in Q4, you see more of that ag business come through again. And so, I wouldn't expect that to be anything different this year than it is in every other year.","And as Bert said, we've got the right plans in place to be able to manage. The inventory, it also helps that we're entering the period of the year where we've got the most planned maintenance and some downtime, and so the combination of some incremental exports, some of the industrial business that we've taken on as well as the plan maintenance. We feel very comfortable with managing the inventory situation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkins of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Harris Fein","Hi, good morning. This is Harris Fein on Chris. Just given the current energy price stack and construction costs? Can you update us on your views on Brownfield versus Greenfield economics for both U.S. and global players? Thank you.","Anthony Will","Yes, I mean, I think what you'd see is in limited locations, it's actually isn't \u2013 labor costs and your ability to lock in fixed costs labor is as important if not more so, in some cases and then absolute gas costs is that you'd expect new capacities to be added where it is being added.","So places like Nigeria, Iran and Russia are places where you can actually get fixed labor cost and in a place like that current economics, if you can get reasonable gas costs and manage the political risk situation. I'd expect there to be some level of building in those locations and I think you've seen kind of that those announcements here and there including people like your came and others looking at incremental units.","I think the challenge in North America is that the labor costs because it's on a reimbursable basis and not on an LSTK basis, no one's willing to take that risk. Is that a urea prices would have to rise, quite a bit where - over where they are today for someone to really take a serious run at it.","And if anyone's talking about it or actually thinking about it just means they're completely inexperienced in terms of dealing with major construction projects over here or just not that's an essentially astute to because we just don't see the current price deck being supportive of newbuild here in North America. By the way, if you find someone that wants to build, we'll sell them the plan for the cost of new construction.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","So my question is that we've seen Chinese exports pick up year-to-date and on one hand that's a good thing because obviously you needed higher prices in order to get the experts out of the country. But on the other hand Chinese production is supposed to be declining for environmental reasons and so forth. So how do you reconcile those two things and do you have any visibility on how much other shadow capacity might be there and sort of what incremental prices would be needed to get it out? Or just in general how you're thinking about the market?","Anthony Will","I\u2019ll give you the general and then let Bert kind of dive into more of the specifics. I think what you're seeing is based on where coal prices are, we absolutely believe that Chinese coal-based capacity is the marginal production capacity, particularly given where gas prices in Europe today. And so we do think that there's a fair bit of capacity that gets campaigned and it runs for a portion of the year or runs it's slightly below or somewhat below a 100% rates for portions of the year.","And so what - that's why their operating rates depending upon what publication you look at and what the denominators they use is somewhere in the 60% to 70% range. So we do think that there is a fair bit of capacity that can turn on and economically will turn on when - what when it's profitable to export. And so I do know that there's a sort of the bear thesis out there that says upside in pricing is somewhat limited because of this overhang or this shelf of capacity.","And I'd say, yes, there probably is some truth that I don't see urea going back to $450 or $500 anytime soon. I just - I think that bids in way too many plants in the interim and people can find a way to make reasonable money as price comes up. But the price indication from \u2013 India from Brazil, from the world in total in terms of the demand side, on that production in the China and the world really needed those tons.","And I think, as our first half results indicate, even if price doesn't go up dramatically, we're very comfortable operating in this sort of environment. We can generate a lot of cash. And I do think our view over the next four years is a somewhat tightening S&D balance going forward, which means that we don't see prices retreating versus where they are today. They may not double, but they're not going to retreat.","And so I think the overarching view is I think China will be there to export when the world demands those tons, it'll be sort of the flywheel that gears up or down depending upon what global demand is. And it's really going to be cost curve driven because they're much more economically or acting in a much more economically rational way now. Bert?","Bert Frost","Yes. Just some key points about that issue, is that 5 years ago where China was producing 71 million, 72 million metric tons to today at 52 million metric tons. They do have a domestic consumption base, which is the largest in the world of approximately 50 million tons, what I would say 48 million to 50 million tons. And so the disposable incremental ton that will be exported has been consistent in the numbers that we've been talking about the last couple of years of 2 million to 3 million tons, and this year that looks to be 3 million to 3.5 million tons.","So in a global exportable ton of around 45 million metric tons, you're talking about an additional 1 million tons. And so I don't think a bear or bull case, it's no fun being a marginal producer and the United States used to be in that position in the early 2000. And so I don't think they can gear up a system to be a major exporter when it's idled a portion of the year. And let's not forget that a portion of those tons that are being exported today are Iranian tons. And so many Panamax\u2019 have been loaded in Iran and discharged it, I mean that's a loose word into China and then reexported or moved or reflaged to other locations.","And so I'm not sure all of that 3.5 billion tons is really Chinese. And so if that is the case and let's say a 1 tons of Iranian product has been moved in, then we're still back to that original thesis of 2 million to 2.5 million tons, and that's digestible by the international market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Donald Carson","Thank you. I just want to go back to the very high in-market premiums we saw this year. The call saying you sold some product out the gate to Port Neal for 400 when NOLA was below 300. Does that become a headwind next year on pricing along with somewhat lower gas costs offshore? So could you quantify what that in-market premium benefit was to you in EBITDA this year?","Bert Frost","So we did experience a very nice position in our in-market premium. And while we're seeing over time is, like I said earlier, the premium expands and contracts. And so it has maintained over the years with this new capacity because we're an import market and you're bidding in tons that have rates and have costs. And so as you have difficulties moving tons or as you have delays or advancement of the season, let's say we have an early season next year. Those issues come into play and come into value.","You're exactly right in terms of a tailwind on gas, gas has been as low as 215 on Henry Hub and on a basis weight that's below, that's actually very cheap in Canada and then some of the places that we produce like in Oklahoma. So those are tailwinds. I don't necessarily see this issue as a headwind in terms of the in-market premium to get something to execute.","Anthony Will","I mean, I think Don in that regard, the U.S. remains an import-driven marketplace and we need to attract, still a fairly sizeable amount of tonnage coming here, particularly when Bert\u2019s team is exporting out of diesel, it even requires more tonnage coming this direction.","And it's always a question in terms of where those exporting regions go with their tons and they're looking for the best netback. And so the U.S. has to bid those tons away from India, from Brazil, from Europe, from other places in order to get them here and then someone's got to get them into the marketplace.","And what we've seen during periods of time, even during fairly what I'd call normal operating conditions, is you get some spikiness in market depending upon the particular year in question. And it has to do with availability of product when and where people are applying and planting because there's a high urgency factor when they're doing the field work.","And so that's one of the benefits that we have with the in-market plans and the distribution network that we've developed, which is we typically can capture some of that when it pops up. It just happened this year. It was a little bit more prolonged, but we've had river issues in the past.","We've had rail line embargoes on some of the major rail carriers, other things like that that have created these kinds of opportunities on a more spot basis. This year, I'd say it was a little more widespread, but that is kind of the power of our system, which is we can capture that when opportunities present themselves.","Dennis Kelleher","Yes, Don. The other thing I'd add is, you asked about the cost curve. Think about lower gas price internationally and let's just focus on LNG in Western Europe. Western Europe is not the marginal producer. And I think that we \u2013 that's proven by the fact that it's taking high prices that we're seeing currently to bid tons out of China that are produced by coal people \u2013 coal based manufacturing. So that really hasn't changed much.","And I think if you look at our slide on \u2013 in the deck, you'll see that the cost per ton of ammonia, whether it's using a \u2013 whether you're using a anthracite coal in China, which is basically the marginal producer today or TTF gas on a forward basis, average for the year. We still have a very substantial cost advantage and we expect that to be maintained.","The gas prices we saw earlier in the year in Western Europe like $4, ourselves at our plant gate. I think if you think about into the Great Britain, the marginal and MMBtu being seaborne LNG. At $4 plant gate, our plants, it's very clear that didn't have value chain. There are people who are not getting paid and so we don't view those prices as sustainable, and if you look at the forward curve, in fact it rises quite significantly above that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Tony, a couple of quarters back, you commented about non-U.S. producers making some suboptimal decisions about where they were shipping in international parity. And clearly since that time, the opportunities into the U.S. haven't been that good. But as things normalize, do you think we're going to continue to see producers favor the U.S. over markets where they might have better economics?","Anthony Will","Yes. Mark, I think in a lot of cases the U.S. access a little bit of a clearing house for some of the tons where there's timing differences between when there's enough inventory for exporters' to send it out and where the demand regions actually need to consume it.","So I think during those shoulder periods, NOLA will probably trade at a bit of a discount to international parity just because there's not that much demand in some of those regions. And then I think there's other times of the year where NOLA is going to trade at parity if not a bit of a premium. If there's high demand periods like we saw earlier this year.","I also think the trade flows are realigning a bit better than where we were a couple of years ago. I think there were an awful lot of traders and importers in the U.S. that really lost a lot of money over the last couple of years.","And I think you've seen a number of the big names dramatically scale back trading operations and some of that activity in response to that. And I think there's just more discipline because the people in the channel that are taking inventory positions, it's not to their benefit to see prices fall after they've already committed.","So I think people are being a little bit more responsible about the volume of tons they're bringing in, and the inland price back to the earlier comment from Don. It wouldn't surprise me to see a little bit of a gapping out between inland price and NOLA price, just if you end up with NOLA being kind of again the liquidity clearinghouse for the world during periods of time.","I don't think you'll see that price necessarily reflected back inland because you don't have the bad behavior that existed before. So I think there's a lot more rationality taking place and that's a good thing.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open. ","Luke Washer","Hi, this is actually a Luke Washer on for Steve. I wanted to touch on the farmer in North America. Did you see a shift in ammonia applications to side-dress this half and did growers, do you think growers applied more than normal, perhaps due to wet weather anticipation for some that would be lost? And just general commentary on if you saw any changes in farmer behavior compared to last year would be appreciated as well. Thanks.","Anthony Will","So regarding North America, yes, we did see a shift to side-dress and we had ammonia going out into July for side-dress. So the change in behavior was that \u2013 was a behavior driven by economics as well as weather, and decision making. There comes a point in time where you have to plant and get your seed in the ground no matter what crop you're planting.","And when I state as well as, I guess even Northern corn states, are trying to put seed in the ground in mid-to-late June. You better have the nitrogen there and ready to go. What happened was they came to the point where you couldn't do pre-plant application wait and then plan they had to get the seed. So we saw a lot of movement late in June and early July of ammonia, as I address on once you had emergence.","And so did they apply more? No, I don't think so. And we can see this from \u2013 some of our crop inspections and work with other people and just information on how much N was applied on average in some of the places that we watch. And you're seeing that holds the historical averages.","The interesting thing for me is going to be the yield. The USDA is still projecting a high acre number as well as a much higher yield number that we think is possible. And I still think there at 166 and I think you'll be lucky to be at 160 and it's going to significantly impact the stocks used ratio coming into this harvest season. And so\u2026","Anthony Will","When also harvested acres were, I mean they're at 91.5 where do you think that's good?","Dennis Kelleher","Well, were our internal numbers probably 84 million, 85 million and so that's what's really still to play. And again, getting back to the nitrogen, but what was applied and was taken up by the crop will be represented in yield? And so we'll see. But I don't think more was applied this year than any other year.","Anthony Will","I mean the other point to highlight is the side-dress of ammonia extending out is not unprecedented before we've had kind of late wet springs and you see ammonia application on the side-dress that through the ice states in particular that is moved out through June and then June, July. And as Bert said, if you look at the total amount of nutrient tons that went down it is more reflective of the kind of numbers that we're thinking about from acreage, not in \u201cover application of nitrogen\u201d in any way.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson of Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson","Good morning. Hi, can you hear me now? Thank you. I just a quick question on ammonium nitrate, I noticed your volumes were down year-over-year and everything else was so strong. Was that deliberate? And maybe you can just talk a little bit about how that market's doing right now?","Anthony Will","When you look at ammonium nitrate for CF, we produce in the UK as well as it Yazoo City. And so as we talk about flexibility, this is now on the North American side, Yazoo City, Mississippi. The flexibility we have at that specific site as we make agricultural grade ammonium nitrate, industrial grade ammonium nitrate, nitric acid, UAN ammonia and DDS.","So that's a very versatile plant for us. And so during this period we saw some opportunities as some of the other products that we were able to segment and move tons to that direction. The other side is the UK assets. We have two plants there that make ammonium nitrate and NPKs. And in that side of the business, we focused less on exports and decided to produce at a different mix. We also make ammonia at that location \u2013 or my make and sell ammonia at those locations. And so that was a little bit of the balance change, but not \u2013 I don't think it was a big shift.","Dennis Kelleher","Yes. And I actually think of first half volume was up not down, but overall it was \u2013 first half was up and again, we really think about this business in half not in quarters, because I think that there was pretty good shipment in Q1.","Anthony Will","Well, okay. There ag season started really early.","Dennis Kelleher","So think about half, not quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar","Thank you. Dennis, first of all, congratulations on your retirement.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks.","PJ Juvekar","I have a comment and a question. My comment is, first of all, kudos to you guys for executing in this difficult environment. I mean, how did your urea volumes go up if you have 10 million plant acres and supposedly it was so wet that farmers couldn't get the tractors out. All the urea volumes you\u2019ve sold, do you think all of that was applied on the ground or do you think some of it is sitting in some of the bins and distributors?","And then secondly for Tony with your strong free cash flow, any thoughts on the M&A possibilities?","Anthony Will","So first of all, thanks for the comment. I think the whole team did an outstanding job this spring. And we do well and things are good, but really when it's challenged, when there are challenges out there is when the flexibility of the network really and the capability of the people really shine. Bert, you want to handle the urea. Did it go down or inventory question?","Bert Frost","So looking at the whole system, obviously we're up quarter-on-quarter, six months on six months and feel very good about that. Again, it goes back to a lot of the discussion that we had in the prepared remarks and as well as some of this Q&A the whole issue of preparation. And when it became apparent to us that ammonia season would be challenged. We called in extra railcars. We'd already gone to maximum urea with an interesting side note that we didn't realize was how do you move all that urea just from the plant to the logistical asset, barges, railcars.","And I give the team a lot of credit with coming up with creative ways working with ARTCO, our barge to fleet as well as power enough barges and get extra barging capacity. So we started working on this in April and with a flooded river or at least a high river at that point, slowing barge movements, we focused on getting those barges up into places where we could unload them and not send them up to St. Louis where they thought they would be embargoed and they ended up being so.","But another side note is we had record truck shipments. So another issue to work with our customers and truck providers. We had urea during the peak of demand. We know some of our urea went 1,200 miles to meet spot demand and trucks are driving a long distance. We designed the Port Neal facility to load up to 10,000 tons a day by truck. And that happened.","So when you take all of these individual movements in a totality as well as building inventory from Q1 to Q2 on purpose, that set us up to be in place and back to how we executed and achieved some of these record high prices and premiums because we were a supplier that had products that could deliver on time. ","Anthony Will","But I think PJ, your question about did it go to ground versus is it sitting in a shed at someplace? Our experience with UAN, which is the vast majority of product that we shipped out in July was for prompt delivery and application, which is why we didn't launch the UAN infill program until just earlier this week because we were still seeing demand at spring pricing level, indicates that people weren't stuffing this product into bins and tanks because typically there's a price reset when you reach the application season and moving to the shareholder season.","So all the stuff that we were selling through June and even into July was at spring pricing indicating to us that all of it was going to ground. There was no one that was going to put that stuff into a warehouse because that\u2019s the long hold period for relatively firm pricing.","Bert Frost","Our channel checks for urea and UAN ours as well as our customers is low. And we believe that's represented like you just said, Tony on all this immediate demand, but you just talked about for UAM with the same issue for urea. We do think based on knowledge of barge and barge loadings and that there is a high level of P&K in the market, but not of urea or UAN and especially on the river.","Anthony Will","And PJ, your second question around free cash flow and how we think about that. We have a very, very high conversion rate of EBITDA and free cash on this asset base. And so it puts a high bar out there for us in the way of acquisitions because our focus really is, cash flow per share. That's what we want to drive accretion on. And so are we interested in growth? Absolutely. Are we interested in M&A? Sure. Does it have to be accretive on a cash flow per share basis after we're all said and done? It absolutely does.","So we're looking at things, but if it doesn't pass that test, then we're not going to execute it. And by the way, we've got great other options, which is a share price that yields the free cash flow yield that is still 2x to 3x better than anybody else in the space. So I think we've got a long way to go in terms of our own share price and we don't feel like there's a gun in our head that we have to go and do something that is dilutive.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays. Your line is open.","Sean Gilmartin","Hi, good morning. This is Sean Gilmartin on for Duffy. Thanks for taking the question. Just real quickly, could you maybe give us your take on how we should start thinking about your overall volumes in the back half year in 2019, kind of given the late start in planting and maybe the potential for a late harvest? And I know you mentioned kind of your 2019 view on corn acres and I know nutrition kind of pegged next year's corn acres around 95 million. Curious if you had a view there. Thanks.","Anthony Will","I mean I think Duffy, on the tonnage, if you just look back the last couple of years were sort of between 19 million and 20 million product tons given sort of what the maintenance schedule looks like in the particular product mix. That's not a bad estimate because we basically are, as long as the plants aren't down for maintenance, they're running 24\/7. And over the course of a year, we shipped what we make. So just like the first half of each of the last three years we'd been in 9.8 million, the back half has been relatively consistent as well. So I think that's a pretty good guide for what the volumes are going to look like second half.","Bert Frost","I'm pleased with our order book. I think we're in a good position for their products. We're in good position with managing inventories in the production rates. We talked about ammonia being a little high, but we have so many options at our disposal that I agree with you Tony, that that we'll manage to what the market demands.","However, I think your point on a late harvest is interesting. I was just in Canada, last week and then driving to Michigan and Ohio and did some walks and runs as I go through four cornfields and I was shocked at what I saw was knee high to waist high and fields in need of nitrogen and not that many heat degree days left.","So the likelihood of having that driven by a frost date, and if we were to have an early frost, you're not going to see maturities. And so that product could be cut for silage or just will be a low yielding. So the late harvest, it depends on dry down and then how much people want to spend on propane.","And so the 2020 acres were bullish. I think 95 as a low end, and don't want to give a higher end. But when you look at stocks to use ratios where we are, we're back to 2013 type levels where corn was up to $7. Now corn today is trading in the 410 range. So what could corn go to?","But I think it's going to go up, but it's going to be, I think people are waiting to see on these harvest results acres results, but it's a positive economic proposition for a farmer today to focus on corn for 2020 and those acres will be available and especially the acres that weren't planted on the preventive plant or the silage acres, those would be planted early.","So you're going to see ammonia going down I think just as we do normally. And if we have a late harvest or and dry down, then we'd have ammonia generally always applied in December. That can happen again.","Anthony Will","I mean I think it's also fair to say that we're probably more bearish on both yield than acres then USCA or in fact than a lot of people are. So to us that says acres next year, both corn price, where it goes off the board this year after harvest and acres next year are going to be in our opinion stronger than where the market's pegging it today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong","Hey, good morning. So I guess just following onto that, sounds like from your commentary, you expect pretty strong nitrogen demand in North America over the next several years, not just next year and it's pretty clear next year it's going to be a really big corn acreage year. But I'm curious about your thoughts on how the crop balance sheets and the pricing changes over the next several years, given your confidence on providing some of that guidance so far out? Thank you.","Anthony Will","Yes. I mean I think when you look at stocks to use down in the mid single-digits, which is where we believe, it's going to end this year that you need 95 plus acres just to get back to where you began this year, which is also a relative.","Well, and so we had this year at least initial and intentions being sort of 92 million, 93 million acres and I would expect if next year is 95 million, you're probably back in the 92 million, 93 million the year after because I just think, the price signals are there.","I also think we expect, ongoing and continued weakness in beans. And whether that's because African swine fever culling of the hog population or ongoing kind of trade concerns or just other related issues and also bumper yields in other growing regions on the bean side.","I think you end up with very, very strong incentives on, certainly a mid-term basis, short and mid-term basis for farmers to grow corn. And so we're \u2013 that that really is the backdrop against our bullish view of corn and also nitrogen demand in North America. Bert, you got?","Bert Frost","Nope, I agree. I think your numbers are spot on where you see a positive market.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open. ","John Roberts","Thank you, and congrats to Dennis as well and also the Christopher. And I wanted to go back to your earlier comment that prices are not high enough for expansions. Was that directed just towards Greenfield since nutrients announced some small expansions recently? And I would guess your new clients have some pretty low costs. Incremental de-bottleneck opportunities?","Anthony Will","Yes. I mean it clearly, well I was talking about John with respect to expansions are putting in a whole new \u2013 ammonia urea complex, not incremental bottlenecks. I think generally speaking, once you've got the infrastructure in place at de-bottleneck is going to have much favorable economics to building a whole new plant.","And it was really, whether it's a Greenfield or a Brownfield, building a new ammonia plant and then upgrade facility. But we're certainly evaluating similarly de bottleneck opportunities and additional flexibility. I think this year in particular highlights the value of product flexibility in the more levers Bert can pull in order to manage what the product, slight mix looks like the better off our returns are.","And given our strong cash flow and ability to invest some of that into some high return projects that that add flexibility to the network, but are still fairly low cost in terms of the scale of a new plant is a great return. So we're looking at that kind of stuff too.","But most of that can be accomplished within the framework of our normal CapEx budget, when we say 400 to 450 that include some growth capital in there. And I think that's a pretty good number for us going forward and gives us some upside in terms of both product mix flexibility margin and absolute tonnage.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys. We early on talked about the economics of new plants and then completely agree that the economic starting to urea plant doesn't really make sense today. But we are also seen as LNG price have fallen so much and you realize now the most profitable use of natural gas.","And so two part question, are you seeing any indication from places like Trinidad that they're going to allocate more natural gas towards urea over LNG, so reversing the trend for the last several years. And second, what do you think the risk and outlook is for places like your Iran works Trinidad to sanction urea just to find the least bad version to get rid of the word - to export their method?","Bert Frost","Yes, I mean I think Trinidad in particular has had some challenges with respect to gas availability at the low costs that they had promised long-term contracts on. And so when most of those Caribbean based contracts have come up for renegotiation they'd been reestablished that a fundamentally different kind of profit sharing as well as floor price than initially envisioned.","And it's not clear to me that there's enough new gas available in terms of the supply price that they're willing to offer that would instant capacity going into Trinidad. Again I think that much more likely to see that in the places like Nigeria and Russia and so forth. Relative to if there is some sort of reallocation of the hydrocarbon molecules in some of those regions so that they can generate more tax revenue, I think you don't have to look very far to figure out that the returns on urea are far superior to methanol today.","And if there was going to be some sort of did you say embargo or whatnot, I think you'd see some rationalization of methanol operating rates in favor of urea. But there aren't a lot of urea plants in those regions that are sitting idle today. Everything is running in full on. So it's really more of a four year fix because you'd have to build a new ammonia urea complex and that's a long time in the future to be looking at that. You certainly could go through a methanol cycle that reverses course in that time horizon. So I know that's not one of those things that we look at and are terribly worried about.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Michael Piken of Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yes. Hi, I just wanted to touch base a little bit on Iran and your expectations for 2019 uranium exports every day, sending a lot of product into Brazil we'd heard. So just your thoughts there and how you see the potential for exports trending mattresses here, but over the next couple of years?","Anthony Will","Good morning, Michael. I think, look our view has always been there's too much money at stake for those plants to run or not run. That they're going to run and they're going to find some way to get those times out. And whether it's sending them to China and re export them, send them direct to India or Brazil and barter or do something in the way of an exchange.","Our view is those plans have been running and will continue to run. And I think the only time where you may see any sort of upset in that process is if they go down for maintenance or turnaround issues and are not able to get either the technical support or the catalyst or the critical vessels to bring them back online.","And so I think that's really where you might see a pressure point, but that's a little bit longer wave length. That's not this quarter or next quarter. I wouldn't anticipate. So I think those plants have been running and they continue to run. Bert to you.","Bert Frost","Yes, just there has been the various behavior, you've seen these tons, as Tony mentioned for a price people will do certain things and those prices have been low. So they're not a very attractive business for the Iranians, but they have been creative in bartering re-flagging, re-exporting from China. And I do think their tonnage will be lower as a result of these sanctions continues, but they've been creative so far.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions for today. I would like to turn the call back to Martin Jarosick for closing remarks.","Martin Jarosick","Thanks everyone for joining us. And we look forward to seeing you at conferences over the next few months.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"4822":["CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) Q2 2014 Earnings Call August  7, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Dan Swenson - Senior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","W.

My name is Nicholas. I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Sir, please proceed.","Dan Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Swenson, and with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its second quarter 2014 results yesterday afternoon, as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com, and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.

These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. CF Industries reported EBITDA of $613 million for the second quarter and adjusted EBITDA of over $1.1 billion for the first half of 2014 despite the challenges of relatively low nitrogen prices globally and North American gas prices that were higher and more volatile than any we've faced in the past 4 years.","I'm pleased to report that our capacity expansion projects, both Donaldson, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa, remain on time and on budget. I'd ask you to please refer to Slides 5 through 8 in our deck for a snapshot of recent progress at those sites.","We also announced the next phase of our ongoing commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, with both a new $1 billion share repurchase program and a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend.","Now I'd like to provide some perspectives on the market. The past several quarters have tested and affirmed our views of the global nitrogen cost curve, the long-term structural cost advantage of North American natural gas, and the strength and cash-generating power of our business model. Given that there remains excess production capacity globally, nitrogen continued to trade based on supply-side economics, where product pricing is set near the cash cost of the marginal producer. In the first half of 2014, there were production shutdowns in several high-cost regions, including Eastern Europe and even some Chinese production, confirming once again the validity of the global cost curve and the rational economic behavior of industry participants.","In North America, coming into 2014, ammonia inventories were high and related prices depressed as a result of the poor 2013 spring and fall application seasons. Low ammonia prices, combined with almost ideal application conditions, led to brisk demand. This spring, our teams did an excellent job of execution to deliver all-time record ammonia shipments of 1.1 million tons for the quarter and 1.7 million tons for the first half of the year.","On the natural gas side, North America experienced its coldest winter in 30 years. This dramatically increased gas usage for heating and led to record withdrawals from storage, driving gas prices above $5 per MMBtu at times. However, as expected, the natural gas supply response was swift. Gas production increased significantly and led to record levels of injections into storage, contributing to prices today below $4 per MMBtu. During the first half of this year, we were able to mitigate the worst effects of the high prices with our hedging program, resulting in our realized gas cost of $4.27 per MMBtu compared to the Henry Hub average of $4.81. We remain confident in our long-term view that gas will trade between $3 and $5.","I'll turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to expand on these points in just a moment, but first I want to highlight how we continue to deliver on our capital stewardship commitment to shareholders.","Our focus continues to be: increase CF's nitrogen production and cash flow generation per share of stock, while lowering the overall cost of financing the enterprise. We are fully committed to the belief that this is the best approach to generate significant value for our shareholders over the long run. In terms of how we are going about this, first is our investment in high-return growth projects. We continue to make significant progress on our expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, which will increase our nitrogen production capacity and potential cash generation by roughly 25%. Both projects remain on time and on budget, and I fully expect that by this time next year, our new urea plant at Donaldsonville will be up and producing product, that's Page 6 of the slides, with the other operating units soon to follow.","Second is our share repurchases. Back in 2012, we announced a $3 billion share repurchase program that was originally scheduled to run through the end of 2016. Last night, we announced that we had completed that original program in less than half of the time allocated and now are effectively upsizing it by 33%, adding a new a $1 billion authorization.","Since the Terra acquisition in the first half of 2010, just 4 years ago, we have repurchased $4.5 billion of our stock, reducing our share count by 32%, which now stands at less than 50 million shares outstanding.","Third is dividends. We announced a 50% increase in our regular quarterly dividend, which is now $1.50 per share. Since our IPO in August of 2005, our annual dividend has increased from $0.08 per share to $6 per share, a compound annual growth rate of 62%. We have demonstrated a consistent track record of increasing our dividend over time. Until our capacity projects are complete and operational, we continue to target a dividend yield roughly that of the S&P, something in the range of 1.5% to 2%. We believe this dividend payment will make CF's shares attractive to a broad set of investors who share our belief in the sustainable cash flow characteristics of this company.","Even with the following all true: one, there is excess nitrogen production capacity globally and prices, therefore, are set on supply-side economics; two, China exported over 4 million metric tons of urea in the first half of 2014; three, ammonia inventories were high and prices somewhat under pressure; and four, North American gas cost was higher and more volatile than it has been in 4 years. Even with all of that true, we still generated over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the first 6 months of the year. It is the consistent, reliable, sustainable, ongoing cash flow generation of this company that enables us to constantly undertake these capital stewardship initiatives.","Now let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to provide a deeper discussion of our operations during the quarter. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Thanks, Tony. We had an exceptionally strong spring application season in 2014. We were worried throughout the early part of the quarter that intermittent, wet and cold weather would impact farmers' ability to apply nitrogen. But in the end, farmers had an extended period of good weather for nutrient application in the latter part of the quarter. We demonstrated that come what may in terms of weather conditions, the strength of our unrivaled asset base and dedicated employees allow us to perform and serve our customers well. We were able to capitalize on a fantastic North American ammonia season by managing our system of storage and logistical assets to maximize product deliveries to customers. We shipped 1.1 million tons of ammonia in Q2 and reached a 6-month record of 1.7 million tons. Shipments were very strong throughout the systems with the Northern and Canadian terminals catching up later in the quarter as cold and wet weather in those areas subsided and application continued through June. Pre-plant and side-dress applications were robust throughout the Corn Belt but especially healthy in the I states of Iowa, Illinois and Indiana.","The record ammonia sales were due to investments we've made to increase our peak receiving and loading capacity our in-market distribution facilities. These investments support a continuing trend toward shorter ammonia application seasons. We have invested in new loading racks, pumping equipment and control systems in several of our distribution facilities and plant locations. Among the shipping record set this spring was a new truck loading record at our Medicine Hat facility, where we loaded over 2,300 tons of ammonia in a 24-hour period, surpassing the prior record by 13%.","As Tony mentioned earlier, we've seen a rational -- we see rational producer behavior in reactions to global urea prices. Chinese producers exported 4.2 million metric tons of urea for the calendar year through June, a 219% increase over the same period in 2013. This brought the July to June fertilizer year rate to 11 million metric tons and put pressure on global prices. But our view of the cost curve was proven as producers in high-cost regions such as Romania, Lithuania and Estonia, along with some Chinese production, shut down as prices went below their cash costs.","Last year, urea prices moved down beginning in February until settling out in October. During that time period, some importers to North America incurred losses, as product prices moved down during the time for when they bought offshore product to when they transported and sold that product in-market. We believe some retailers saw a margin compression after taking inventory positions earlier in the year only to have lower sales prices when farmers stepped forward to purchase and apply urea. As a result, this led to buyer reluctance in 2014 to hold inventory and be exposed to price risk.","During the first half of 2014, forward prices for urea were lower than spot prices, which discouraged imports into the United States as traders feared potential losses. As a result, North American urea inventories were tight during the second quarter and when demand emerged in the spring, prices at the U.S. Gulf remained above international price parity. We chose to accept the inventory-carrying risk and were rewarded when we decided to price only spot sales and avoid forward sales to any great degree.","We were able to achieve a very attractive average price of $396 per short ton when the average U.S. Gulf price during the quarter was $356 per short ton, and the middle Eastern granular FOB price was $288 per short ton.","We planned for robust UAN demand from late April through June. We stored products in the terminals in the absence of first quarter demand, and we planned to pick up spot sales in the cross market. However, the strong and lengthy ammonia season took some demand away from UAN. We managed this change in market conditions by selling into the strong ammonia demand and utilizing our distribution facilities to pick up available UAN sales opportunities.","As a result of capturing these opportunities and due to some production issues during the quarter at our Woodward complex, plus our exports in Q2, our UAN inventories were at normal levels by the end of the quarter. We launched our ammonia and UAN fill programs earlier this year than last. The programs had good demand, and we have built an attractive order book.","We expect the second half of 2014 to be positive, but a little different from 2013. In 2013, urea prices entered July around $300 per short ton of the U.S. Gulf and then moved down to $280 per short ton by mid-October. The outlook last year did not appear very positive due to the abundant amount of Chinese urea stored at the Chinese ports and ready for export. Urea pricing pulled the overall nitrogen price structure lower, and the general outlook was negative.","In 2014, as we enter Q3, urea prices in North America continued to be above international levels. We expect that a large amount of urea imports in August and September will bring the North American price structure toward parity with the world market and thus, prices of the U.S. Gulf could be around $310 to $330 per short ton in the fourth quarter.","UAN and ammonia fill programs have already been accepted in the market, and a significant amount of volume has been ordered and will be shipped over the coming months. We believe that the UAN and ammonia fill price structure will provide a solid base for business through Q4.","With the size of our order book and the potential for rail and barge system congestion, with the expected demand for transporting grain and other products this fall, we will be focused on moving our product into position to satisfy existing orders and expect to have a relatively limited volume available for new orders for UAN and ammonia.","Going out into 2015, even though we have seen a decline in corn prices, we believe that over 90 million acres of corn will be planted in the United States, which should result in solid nitrogen demand. Corn continues to offer farmers more attractive economics than soybeans, and fertilizer costs are projected to be attractive and in line with the 10-year average as a percent of crop revenue.","Even at lower corn prices, North America would still be a significant import region for nitrogen, and with our unmatched portfolio of in-market production, logistical assets and distribution facilities, we have the flexibility to produce whatever form of nitrogen the market demands and have it into position at the appropriate time in order to sell every ton we produce.","Now let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Bert. With the strength of our ammonia shipments and the effective work of our sales and distribution teams, we generated strong earnings as represented by $613 million of EBITDA, which was 42% of net sales during the quarter.","Our EBITDA was negatively affected by several items in the second quarter of 2014. Our cost of goods sold was higher as inventory produced during the first quarter, when our fixed gas costs were higher was sold and those higher gas costs made their way through our income statement.","During the second quarter of 2014, we also had higher fixed cost absorption rates in our cost of goods sold due to unscheduled downtime, particularly at our Woodward complex, where we incurred approximately $20 million in expenses.","Other operating expenses of approximately $22 million included $7 million specifically related to the expansion projects. We are separating out these project expenses due to the fact that they will go away when the expansions are complete.","As Tony mentioned earlier, the structural cost advantage of North American natural gas was made evident by what has happened with gas prices over the past 2 quarters. During this winter, we saw record storage withdrawals and short-term weather-related volatility in gas prices, which, at times, traded over $5 per MMBtu on the NYMEX. However, the underpinnings of the enduring advantage of North American gas, a large proven resource base, increasing producer efficiencies and an expanding infrastructure of pipelines and equipment to bring gas to market resulted in a quick supply response. Additional supply came into the market, resulting in gas injection levels that have averaged over 100 billion cubic feet during each of the last 12 weeks.","In the near term, gas prices, which have dipped back below $4 per MMBtu since mid-July. With the benefits provided through our hedging program, our realized gas purchase price for the second quarter was $4.19 per MMBtu compared to the average Henry Hub price of $4.58.","In May, we assessed the natural gas market and determined it would be appropriate to add hedges for the third quarter to mitigate our cost risk from potential short-term summer price spikes. When the second quarter ended, we had in place hedges for 90% of our gas needs for the third quarter via collars in a range of $4.25 to $4.60 per MMBtu.","Since the end of the quarter, as gas prices have declined, we've hedged 90% of our October gas needs with collars between $3.50 and $4 per MMBtu.","We continued our growth investments in the second quarter with $209 million of cash expenditures on our capacity expansion programs and $83 million for all other capital projects. The capacity expansion projects are progressing on schedule and on budget. Activity has included the completion of foundation piling, the arrival of certain major equipment and the erection of structural steel, which is now proceeding at both locations, some of which is highlighted on the photos on Slides 5 through 8.","Construction of nonproduction facilities, including urea warehouses and ammonia storage tanks, is also well underway.","In conjunction with this release, we are reducing our full year capital expenditure forecast from $2.5 billion to approximately $2.2 billion. As the capacity expansion projects have progressed, we've gotten a better view of timing of our expenditures and expect that some of those amounts will be incurred in 2015 rather than 2014.","We also have performance incentives in place with a number of our contractors that we are holding back until the end of the project, so these expenditures won't be made until we reach completion.","We do expect to see a much higher rate of spending in the third and fourth quarters as we take deliveries of additional equipment and hit peak mechanical construction activities. We are confident that we have the liquidity and operating cash flow to fund all of our strategic initiatives. As of the end of the second quarter, we had total liquidity of $3.8 billion, including our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash for the expansion projects and availability under our revolving credit facility. We are committed to our investment-grade credit rating as it enables us access to long-term, low-cost financing and provides us the flexibility to pursue our strategic objectives. With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dennis. As you've heard, our business is running very well. CF is generating strong margins and deploying the resulting cash flow to further increase shareholder value. I would like especially to thank our team and distribution facilities for their exceptional work during the quarter. Their focus on safe and efficient operations enabled us to set all-time ammonia shipping records and serve all of our customers' needs.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Dan Jester on for P.J. today. So I just wanted to follow up on Bert's comments about the urea imports into the U.S. expected to pick up over the next coming months. I guess, are dealers hesitant to restock at today's prices? And can you maybe talk about your order book, specifically for urea today as it compares to maybe this time last year?","Bert A. Frost","With the need to import a significant amount of urea and really all of nitrogen products into the United States, I'd even add P&K, because of the significant drawdown that we experienced through Q2 and into Q3, we're going to have to be very active. I think there are some challenges to make that happen due to the rail constraints and, as I mentioned in my remarks, the barges used where you're seeing barge pricing go up significantly. And that will probably last through into Q4. And so there is a need. You can't wait until spring for any of these products to put in an order and have it magically appear in the short term. So there is going to be a buildup. We are seeing positive demand for our products, but we are continuing in the same vein of selling more into the spot market because of the price realization that's available in that market as compared to the forward market. We have commitments in place, but they are unpriced for future demand. So we see healthy demand and shipping of our products, but we do see imports maintaining at a similar pace. For -- regarding imports for urea, compared to previous year's at this time year-to-date, the numbers we have are through June, the United States is roughly 600,000 tons behind the previous year's import rate. And what you will see, I think, again with the drawdown, you had urea going on top for extra. As farmers were preparing for yield or applying for yield over cost, you had a lot of urea and UAN going down into July -- through July. So we still believe that the inventory levels are low, and coupled with the 600,000 deficit, you will need to be importing a significant amount.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then it sounds like you think that the transportation and logistics challenges are going to continue. Does it make sense to invest even more in sort of storage capacity in-market or more truck-loading facilities so that you can be even more flexible going forward?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, it depends on the product, and we are investing for -- in terms of the facility that we have, we are investing on efficiency issues, safety issues, and we'll continue to do so as appropriate. But we have tons of flexibility today in terms of when you factor in looking at ammonia, pipeline ability, barge ability and then we will probably go rail to truck. And with -- for urea, we rely a lot on our customers' facilities. There have been a significant amount of unit train facilities built. We sold 4 of our assets, our dry assets, to GROWMARK several years ago because of that viewpoint that our customers were better utilizers of those assets than we were. We still utilize our Pine Bend facility, which is at the end of the Mississippi, for receiving urea and other products. And so I think that the investments, as appropriate and as we can leverage and use them, we will do that, but it depends on the site and the market.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to sort of square the buyback announcement with a few things. You used to have a chart in the deck that sort of went through the amount of excess cash you thought you might generate over the next couple of years, and I think you kind of could eyeball that, it would look like close to $2 billion. Notwithstanding the fact you bought back an extremely impressive amount of stock so far year-to-date, just kind of curious how -- where the $1 billion number comes from and why it isn't a bigger number over a longer period of time or a smaller number or a shorter period of time. I mean, it looks like you have enough cash flow between what's on hand and what's coming in to certainly do it by the end of the year, but you're talking out to '16. So what are the puts and takes as well that will cause you to do it slower or faster? And then just as a follow-up, there's been some interesting developments in the MLP market in the last months. I'm just wondering if you have any update on your thought process there.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, Vincent, if you look at -- if you go back to what we -- I think if you were referring to the slide that was presented in New York last year, you'll all have your own view as to what operating cash flow will be over time, but I think it's important to understand that, that slide sort of talked about a number of priorities. And one of our key priorities, obviously, is to continue to do what we're doing with our capacity expansion projects, which are mid-teens returns project, which is invest in those things and finish those things on time and on budget, which we're on track to do. We finished the share repurchase program that was authorized back in 2012, as you point out, on an accelerated basis, I think, in most people's minds. And then we've also authorized the additional $1 billion. We will be assessing our operating cash flow and excess liquidity and stuff as we go through time. And we'll make adjustments to the things that we do as we've done in the past. But I think that as far as the $1 billion is concerned, I think that represents, like Tony said, an upsizing really of the current program. And it just continues to underline our bias towards share repurchases and our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. If things develop in a good way, in the way we think they're going to develop, there could potentially at some point in time in the future be upside. But at this point in time, there's no way we can commit to that or know that. But we were assessing this thing on a real-time basis, and we'll continue to do that.","W. Anthony Will","And Vincent, what I would add to that is, we have historically been and continue to be a reasonably conservative company in terms of our commitments. And so we only commit to things that we know that we can accomplish and, as Dennis said, front and center is our execution and completion of our capacity expansion projects. And they are on time and on budget, but you're never done until they're actually operating. And the place where a lot of the expenditure happens is at the tail end of those things, and we want to make sure that we maintain absolute financial flexibility and liquidity through start-up and operation. And so for us, it's not an issue of, \"Is there more?\" It's more just a timing question of, \"Do we do it now?\" or is it after we've got clear visibility to start up and things are running and then there's more liquidity to return down the road. And so I think what you've seen from us is a measured appropriate paced cadence to this such that we're not doing anything at all to endanger our investment grade credit rating and our liquidity position. I think that's consistent with the way that philosophically we want to run this business.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, Vincent, you also asked about the MLP, and I just wanted to let you know, we have completed, with the 2 banks, our study of MLPs and not surprisingly because I think we've talked about this in the past. As we look at the existing assets, it does not make sense for us to sell those things into an MLP. Obviously, there's a large tax hit associated with that because they're low-tax basis assets. So the economics of that just in and of themselves doesn't make sense. I think as far as the capacity expansion projects are concerned, it's worth noting that these capacity expansion projects are at the very core of our business. They are not peripheral activities. They are core to our strategy. And in addition to that, the retention value of those things when we look at the amount of DCF basis is very likely to be well in excess of anything that could be achieved by selling them into an MLP. So while I can't say with absolute certainty that we would not look at MLP as an option for those in the future, I would say that it's very unlikely because, again, those are assets that are at the core of our business. Those assets will have a very high retention value, and those assets also provide us with additional debt capacity when they come on in 2016, 2017. And as you know, we're able to access the investment grade debt market in big chunks for yields on an after-tax basis that are very low. So that's where we've gotten to with the MLP.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Bert, question for you. I was somewhat surprised at the high amount of ammonia sales that you had, especially given that the spring was very wet and very late. Just wondering if you can talk a bit more about that. Was that catch-up from last fall? Was that just sort of a pricing issue? And just wondering what impact on this mix did additional sales to Mosaic have in the Tampa area.","Bert A. Frost","Okay. Yes, there was an impact because of the 2013 fall application season. We estimate there's approximately 400,000 tons that didn't go down in the United States, and there was some pickup. But what you had in Q2 was a pretty favorable price structure. I think ammonia was a good value starting off. We came in -- we, at CF, and I think the industry came in with high inventory levels. And then the weather was very conducive. We had an open window early in the quarter, and then it was wet and cold for several weeks, which allowed resupply. Again, another burst in May. And again, and then another wet cold period, some resupply, and then the Northern system kicked off, which is Belle in the Grand Forks and the Canadian terminals that we purchased last year, and we had an exceptional run up there. So when you combine and put everything together it just worked really, really well. And then the side-dress season kicked in, where there was abundant on our side, at least enough inventory remaining. And we had good pull really into early July. The Mosaic impact was not that great. We probably moved about, I think it was 53,000 tons to Mosaic during Q2. Our ag percentage normally were a 70\/30 range. We were more 80\/20, and the Mosaic, you can run the numbers, it was probably about 5% of that. So while it's nice volume, we appreciate Mosaic as a customer. It did not have a big impact on our ammonia movement.","W. Anthony Will","Got it. Just to tag along with Bert, I think there's a couple of things that underlie -- drove that. One of which is, we now own 100% of the Medicine Hat facility, where a year ago, we were kind of just phasing into that in terms of having closed in the spring and as Bert said didn't really have full operational control of the Canadian terminals. Two is we are seeing annualized full year effects of some of the debottlenecks we've done at our other operating ammonia plants at Verdigris and at Donaldsonville and so we've got some incremental production that's online there. And then third is the inventory starting position coming in. So we -- all 3 of those things, in addition to the Mosaic contract, led to a pretty favorable ammonia run for us.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on your gas hedging strategy. You seem to be much more active in hedging your gas position over the last 12 months. Some quarters, it benefits you. Some, it doesn't. I'm just wondering why you become more active and why not just take more of an approach to manage the peaks in the summer and winter months?","W. Anthony Will","Yes, Don, I think it's a great question. Let me just talk a little bit about philosophically how we view this, which is we really take hedging positions for 1 or 2 reasons either we are trying to get rid of negative volatility events or we really like the pricing in terms of where the strip is trading in the forward. And as we sat in the third and fourth quarters of last year, we took a number of hedged positions for the first and second quarters of this year really for both of those reasons. We liked where the strip was trading, and we were concerned about potential weather events. And both of -- it turned out to be a great decision at that time because gas traded substantially above where we had hedged. As we said in May of this year, storage in North America was almost a full TCF lighter than it has been over the last 5-year average. And we were really concerned that a hot summer with a lot of air-conditioning requirements could have sent gas market in a very volatile, spikey, northerly direction. And we wanted to take that risk off the table. And so at the time we could have locked in swaps at $4.50 or $4.52, we decided to put collars in instead in order to participate in some of the downside if our fears -- worst fears weren't realized, and in fact, participate down to $4.25. And we're delighted, in fact, that the things have moved the direction they did. I think it was the right decision that we made. And again, if we were sitting in May, what we were really trying to do is eliminate the negative volatility consequences that are potentially out there. And for the year, we're still more than $60 million to the good based on our total hedging positions, whether they be realized positions or mark-to-market in terms of where the current strip is. So I think -- do you get every one of them right? No. But we're not trying to actively be in there trading in order to get every one right. What we're really trying to do is manage the negative volatility so we can deliver results to the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","I think you'd sort of alluded to this in some of your prepared remarks, but as you think about kind of the UAN market over the next 3 to 6 months, it sounds like you have a comfortable position in terms of your forward book based on some of your fill participation. How is that going to impact your export business in the back half of the year? And do you think that you have enough orders sufficiently here that you might not have to ship as much off as you did maybe in some other time periods in the past?","Bert A. Frost","The UAN market, what we believe it's -- we're very well positioned based on our fill program, the acceptance of the fill program and our customer activity and desiring to purchase more. We've limited it to a certain quantity, and we're still active in the market. We are still selling at various points, both for prompt and for forward. But we anticipate that this market should continue to improve based on the fundamentals for the other end products. And so exports, we participate in the export market really as a third option as we have opportunities that are available to us that are attractive. This year, we've exported to Europe and to Argentina and a little bit into Mexico. And we will continue to look at that. We believe all 3 of those markets have continued demand, but there are probably other sources of supply that make more sense for us to ship at this point.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, terrific. And then just shifting gears, if I could just hear you talk a little bit about the timing of when you think some the new capacity is coming online. You indicated that Donaldsonville urea might be starting up a year from now. I mean, do you think that most of the rest of that facility will be on in time for the spring of '16 or should we be thinking that this is more of a back half '16-type event?","W. Anthony Will","No. So Michael, in that regard, we think that within a year, urea will be up and operating and approximately kind of 3 or 4 months after, urea comes up and acid and UAN will be up. We're targeting right now to be mechanically complete or close thereto on the ammonia plants by the end of next year, with commissioning and startup happening in the first quarter, maybe bleeding into the second quarter of '16, for the ammonia plant at D'Ville. In terms of Port Neal, what we've committed to is 2016. We're certainly trying to manage a much more aggressive timeframe than that. And ideally, we'd like to really ramp that up and accelerate it. But we're still a little bit earlier phase there, and we got to make sure we can get through this winter and make good progress, get delivery of all the critical items before we can sharpen the pen in terms of the actual start-up there. But we're certainly, internally managing to a much tighter deadline than the ones that we have committed to on the outside. And that's why we're very comfortable saying we're on schedule because we're well ahead of what we've made external commitments about.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You alluded to supply closures in Eastern Europe in various countries, as well as China, kind of proving out your view of the cost curve globally. Can you speak to how much capacity might have been shuddered in the aggregate? And has any come back online recently? What's your outlook there?","Bert A. Frost","So in the aggregate, I'm uncomfortable giving a specific number, but we do follow these facilities individually, as well as in terms of regions, what is being exported, being produced and what is online and offline. And what you're seeing today, for different reasons, different plants are running or not. Today, right now in Egypt, we've gone through a gas shortage where they're having to bring in LNG. That is impacting the urea, UAN and ammonia supply. With the unrest in Russia and the Ukraine, focused on the Ukraine, you're seeing a significant amount of capacity offline. And today, that represents 7% to 8% of the ammonia traded supply, so a pretty big impact that wasn't expected probably 6 months ago. And the Eastern European locations is more gas-related, gas cost-related, so those plants flex on and off when it's attractive for them to produce and above their cash costs. After an exhaustive study of -- an internal study we did of China, segmenting the different levels of cost of production for anthracite thermal or gas producer, and then laying on the logistical costs, port costs, labor costs, it was interesting to us and how that actually functioned in real time with several of the outlying plants with a higher cost, low -- smaller capacity facilities shutting down this year in May and June when we hit the levels of around $260, $255 for prilled product coming out of China. That market has since improved. We've seen some pricing improvement out of China for both granular and prilled. But you can go around the world, whether it's Pakistan, Argentina, Trinidad, you got gas issues. And so the capacity is out there, yes, but our opinion on the market and how people choose to produce or not have been proven correct that these high-cost facilities do shut down, and we seem to find the floor and then march back up until we hit the marginal producer and they come up. And as we mentioned, Q4 urea could be in the range of $3.10 to $3.30 at the U.S. Gulf, which is an attractive range for us.","W. Anthony Will","Just on that front, Kevin, our urea cost at $4 gas, and we're below $4 currently, but our urea cost for Gulf production is, call it, at $1.50. If Gulf on a cash basis, if Gulf urea is trading in kind of a $3.20 plus or minus range, that's still pretty healthy margins for us. So we're not -- we look at that as being a pretty favorable soft landing, if that's kind of as bad as the fourth quarter is potentially shaping up to be.","Bert A. Frost","I think the question for that -- it's a good price for what Tony just put out there, the question for some of these new builds that are coming are being discussed in the market. That's a pretty skinny margin for a $2 billion to $2.3 billion investment for a greenfield operation. As we bring on our new capacity and other capacity we think the other producers that are currently in the business are bringing on, we think that's a logical place for the U.S. market or the North American market to settle, and there won't be probably a lot of new announcements based on that operating range.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. I guess, the second question, if I may. Corn acreage, obviously, was down this year and you had the Woodward outage. So your production was flat, it looks like, on a year-over-year basis in the quarter, and yet your volumes, if I add up all the product lines, look like they were up about 5%. Can you speak to your inventory levels at this point? Look like the number on your balance sheet was down quite a bit, 36% year-over-year. How lean are you relative to what you would expect for this time of the year?","Bert A. Frost","On the corn acre number, on a percentage basis, we're not down that much, and what we're projecting for 2015 at 90 million acres is still healthy. The corn on corn might be a little bit negative compared to soybeans. But the corn against soybeans, you are going to have a lot of soybean acres transitioning into corn more economically, but agronomically, that make sense. When you look at the Woodward outage, our exports in our whole book are very positive Q2 performance. Our inventories are low, our inventories for all products. And when you look that in conjunction with the lower import numbers that we've received on all products, ammonia, urea, UAN and ammonium nitrate, and from what our interaction with our customers on their low inventory levels, it really sets up a pretty positive operating environment through, I believe, 2015.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I wonder if you could just give us an update on your thoughts about the new nitrogen plants coming up, whether you think that there's been any shift and what's likely to get built? You've talked in the past about some of the logistical challenges, and I'm wondering if any of the near-term logistics have reinforced that view or whether the pressure on the rails to expand capacity might make those projects more viable?","W. Anthony Will","But I mean -- thanks, Mark. I think the issue is not just accessibility of power on the rails or power on the river for barge, which is also under pressure right now. As Bert said, barge rates have gone through the roof. But it's building the tanks and the terminal systems and buying the railcars and developing the rolling stock. So as we look at the Port Neal project on a fully loaded basis, as we fold it into our system, based on having announced it in 2012, we're very comfortable we can deliver that project all-in for $1.7 billion. If you are announcing that project today, because of exchange rate fluctuations, lead time and other cost escalations, labor and so forth, it would probably be close to about $2 billion. And if that project were a greenfield, we think it's been more likely be about $2.3 billion, $2.4 billion. And as Bert mentioned earlier with urea pricing in the Gulf, call it, in the $3.20 range through the fourth quarter, the return profile that's available for a $2.4 billion project is pretty skinny. So we think that there are some people that are likely to go out there and continue to evaluate these projects. But the number of them that are likely to come online is less than what North America imports. So we don't see North America going into a structurally long or export position by 2018 or even 2020. Greenfield costs are so much more because you don't have the logistics systems to feed into. You don't have the direct ties to the rail systems, the gas pipelines, the utility lines and so forth. So it really is a tough thing to do on a greenfield basis. And so we feel very comfortable having the brownfield position that we do and having started the projects when we are -- I think it's possible that you could get a Yara, BASF kind of plants being built and a few others like that, but the number of brand-new greenfield in-market plants, we think, is pretty challenged and, in particular, the one that was announced in Indiana for what was claimed to be $1.6 billion, I take the over on that one.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. If I could just look out a little bit further, you've obviously got your hands full with expansions and people like your current expansion and buyback thing, but we're hearing more and more CEOs, as we look around the world, talk about opportunities outside the U.S. It's been a long time since CF has talked about looking outside the U.S. Is that something that's on your longer-term list of interest?","W. Anthony Will","I think this is the way we view it, which is the global nitrogen market is incredibly fragmented. The largest players in the industry only represent 4% to 5% of the total capacity in the marketplace. So it's really, really fragmented. And traditionally, capital-intensive process businesses tend to consolidate over time. And we believe we're in a great position to do it. But we have no interest in going into places that don't have great return profiles for our shareholders. We think our stock represents an incredible value and deploying that capital against high-growth, high-return growth projects in North America where there's low political risks and a long-term stable gas availability, we -- and\/ or buying our shares back, we think, is a pretty compelling proposition. So I wouldn't say never, but it's not something that we're out there doing at all costs. Anything that we do in that regard would have to have a great return profile. Otherwise, we're just not interested in doing it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Partners.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible]project at least in the farm belt is proceeding, and that's because of substantial grants from the state. So for those people that still want to build a greenfield plant, Tony, and given the fact that you still have available land, let's say, for example, Port Neal, would it make sense even at this juncture to be looking at partnering with somebody, putting the capital on your site and then having a vigorous offtake agreement?","Dan Swenson","Mark, it's Dan Swenson. The first part of your question didn't come through on the line. Can you repeat the beginning of it?","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was just asking that there are some people out there that still want to build greenfield plants, yet the economics don't look good. So connecting the dots, would it make sense to put another ammonia urea train, perhaps, at Port Neal, and partner up with someone who wanted to build a greenfield but just couldn't make the numbers work.","W. Anthony Will","Yes, we have no interest in helping facilitate other's entry into this marketplace. If the capacity is needed in the market and there's good economics, we think we're fully able to justify building the project on our own and for the benefit of our own shareholders. And as Dennis said, each one of these things just further enhances our ability to fund it with or take on some additional debt service and capital. So we think we can do it if the marketplace desires it. It's really a question about, does the market need it and is the return profile attractive for us to do it. And we are fully committed right now. We don't have the bandwidth to be chasing those things. So we're going to finish what we've started and then reevaluate where we're at, then be very thoughtful about it. But I'm going to turn it over to Bert and let him talk a little bit about the market.","Bert A. Frost","Yes, I think where the market perspective, we have a very solid customer base, so we work closely with our customers based on their requirements for the products that we produce, and we have contracts in place and take patterns to make sure that our product move seamlessly through to the end of the market. On top of that, what we've talked about our distribution system for UAN and ammonia that works very, very well that our customers are able to utilize. But if we had to make a move into the market and acquire or build storage in some of the key markets to move our product, we're willing to do that. That's a very inexpensive way to move our product if we had to do, let's say, urea into certain markets. Port Neal is targeted toward some very attractive urea consumption market in the Dakotas and that we think Donaldsonville will come up into the lower part of the United States, then you have Medicine Hat. So we're well positioned to supply all areas of the major consumption regions and through debottlenecks or whatever else, we can add additional capacity fairly inexpensively.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And kind of a housekeeping question. To what extent that the Woodward outage affect production, or more importantly, shipments? Could you have shipped more had Woodward outage not occur?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, we could have. It did -- we lost several months of production. We were down in mid-April, didn't come back until late June, really, for only July shipments. And so it did negatively impact our ability, and that product would've gone into the market. And so we tend to run our plants full speed all the time and get that product end of the market on a ratable basis.","W. Anthony Will","Yes, I mean, we lost that plant for almost the entire quarter, and that directly affected results, both on the expense line side and the fact that we didn't have the revenue coming out of it. Even that said though, we did run our entire system at 96% of rated capacity on the ammonia side. We target closer to 98% or 99%. We think that, that's what readily achievable quarter in and quarter out because there's always going to be some amount of turnaround activity and\/or some amount of just unexpected outage. So a couple of points below, but the good news, I guess, if there is any, there was that: one, Woodward is one of our smaller ammonia plants and facilities; two, we didn't have any injuries or other kind of problems and we were able to bring the plant back up and it's in full operation now. So we're back kind of up and running on all cylinders.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I mean, in light of your forecast for lower year-over-year corn acreage, is there any appetite or interest in trying to layer in more industrial exposure as we head into 2015 to maybe smooth out what could potentially be increased volatility in ag chemical prices?","W. Anthony Will","Tim, we look at industrial business as an important part of our platform, and I'm going to turn it over to Bert here a little bit to jump into more detail. But I'll tell you, we like the ag market. It generally trades at a premium to industrial. Now you have to have the logistics and distribution infrastructure. You have to have that expertise in your sales force and your other people to be able to participate in that. And some competitors say they prefer industrial because they don't like the volatility. Well, the volatility is all on the positive side relative to industrial. It doesn't go the other direction. So all you have to do is look at what some of the other people who like industrial's price realization is versus ours and you see the benefit of being in the ag marketplace. So I would much prefer to be there, but we do, do some base-loading of industrial business because it's part -- helpful to building an overall book of business.","Bert A. Frost","I think -- this is Bert. As you've seen us transition since the Terra acquisition from a very low level of industrial business to I would say an appropriate amount today, it's really as we look at the business and you're always rationalizing your opportunities and looking at them and choosing what is the best medium and long-term for the company. And so that's a mix of ag industrial and exports. And we've exported all 4 of our nitrogen products. We have industrial customers for all those products also, except UAN. We enjoy our Mosaic contract and look forward to building and growing into that. Our Orica contract that will grow beginning in 2017 is a very good contract. And then our various agreements for ammonia shipments throughout the United States and North America. And so it's a good mix for us. We are able to leverage our assets and we think achieve a healthy return on our investment because of that mix.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one last question, if I may. More detailed question on mid-Corn Belt ammonia pricing. If you go back to 2009 and kind of a similar corn price environment, obviously, acreage was well below 90 million acres that year. But we still saw several quarters where that premium in mid-Corn Belt ammonia really collapsed almost near urea prices. As we look out, is there any reason why that would not reoccur from your perspective? And if so, why not?","Bert A. Frost","I don't see that happening. You just got a different market today than 2009. If you want to go back to 2009, ammonia traded in the U.S. Gulf at $125 a ton because people were desperate to get rid of their ammonia. That was more of an economic and a wholesale collapse in the commodities segment. I don't see that happening today. And the Corn Belt has actually held firm, and it will continue to do so. And why that is, is the freight structure has changed in North America. You can no longer move ammonia for $30 a ton in a railcar halfway across United States. That's more like $200 a ton. And so the ability to move your product and have the terminals, and again, going back to our system, the percentage that goes up by pipe, that is very safe and through our system that had shipped out by truck directly to a local market, and then it's moved by barge, which we have barge ability directly into our terminals are on the river systems, as well as out of Palmyra to shuttle product back and forth during peak demand, and what we're doing is moving product off the rails of ammonia. And so I think that there is a demand for ammonia. It's an agronomically very good product when you're utilizing the 4Rs, which the TFI and the CFI have been propagating and communicating to our industry. And so I see ammonia continuing as a very strong product in our product portfolio.","W. Anthony Will","Tim, the other thing I would say is, there's been some shifts in terms of how the market is operating. So you've seen a number of industry participants, some of our competitors, that have done upgrade projects and other things like that, that have in fact shrunken the amount of available ammonia there is in the Corn Belt. And so -- because that product now shows up in terms of urea or UAN. So the number of tons that are available in the marketplace are actually less. And it's not really possible for importers to come in and bring in ammonia because they don't have in-market storage. It's only really 3 producers that have a significant in-market storage. And therefore, when in-market production goes down the way it has because more of it's being upgraded, it really means that there's not the opportunity for that price collapse.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'll just ask the one. Tony, I remember comments you made last year about you saw CF as really a global company, that it was fortunate to have its assets located in North America. And so thinking globally, among Ukraine instability, Russian sanctions, Middle East conflict, Argentine turmoil, I mean, maybe your typical summer, but what do you see as having the biggest potential geopolitically to maybe disrupt your business over the next few years? Is it some kind of Chinese-Russian natural gas agreement? Would it be trade barriers that pop up somewhere? Or all this do you really see as maybe having the potential for continued prolonged constraints on effective supply?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. I actually think it's more the second part of that, which is, at the end of the day, people need to eat, plants require nitrogen, it is not a discretionary nutrient and farmers understand that and apply it every year. We see nitrogen demand continuing to go up about 2% per year. And in fact, all of the things that you're talking about, which create various supply disruptions at different points in the world, really just help us. And our -- one of the benefits of being a global participant but with a North American production base is we are not prone to the same kind of instability and disruption that those other areas are. And if the Brazilians need to import more nitrogen and are willing to pay a premium for it, we're in a prime position to be able to ship it to them. So we really like-- have our asset base and where our new production is going to start coming online here pretty soon. And it gives us the flexibility of either serving North American farmers' needs or Latin American or other places. So a lot of the stuff that's going on out there is actually, I think, pretty helpful for our business over the long run.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just one question on the dividend, Tony. Maybe if you talk about kind of targeting a dividend yield in line with the S&P, where you just took it to $6 a share, actually gets it a little bit above the S&P today. But just philosophically on a long-term basis, I mean, once the capacity expansions are done, what is the planned dividend payout or how are you thinking about expanding the payout ratio over time?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. I think it's more, at that point, more of a payout ratio that we'll be kind of focusing at right now. As Dennis mentioned earlier, we think our shares continue to be a screaming value. And so we think we need to be kind of in the right range. And again, I'm targeting sort of 1.5% to 2% because, look, we've got 25% of additional capacity that's going to be coming online here in the next -- beginning within a year from now. And so we think there's an awful lot of runway for our shares to move and put us back into that range. And again, given that we think our shares are a big value, we want to make sure that we have a bias in the short term towards share repurchase. As the capacity comes online and as we start generating these really significant increases in cash flow generation, I think it's -- and with the drop-off on CapEx, it warrants a reevaluation of how we position us with respect to both industry peers and the marketplace and what our shareholders are looking for. But I think the important point here is we're not doing anything stupid. We're returning all of the shares and the people that are long-term holders are very thankful that we're heavy-ing up on the share repurchases because it's benefiting them pretty substantially. So we're going to go ahead and continue to keep the dialogue open with shareholders, but our focus is return excess capital.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back to Tony Will for closing remarks.","W. Anthony Will","Thank you. Just want to give a little perspective on the last few years. So we have and we continue to increase the capacity of our business through high return investments. We completed the sale of our Phosphate segment. We've lowered the cost of capital through our investment grade bond offerings. We've grown our dividends by a compound annual growth rate of 62% since our IPO. And we've reduced our share count by 32% since funding the Terra acquisition just 4 years ago. It's a terrific set of accomplishments, one we are committed to continuing on behalf of our shareholders. Thank you for your time today."],"4813":["CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  4, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Dan Swenson - Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications and Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications","Stephen R.

","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Dan Swenson, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications.

On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by Federal securities laws.

Wilson","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I want to welcome Dan to our team. His predecessor, Terry Hutch, set the bar pretty high. I'm confident that Dan is up to the challenge of raising it higher. ","Yesterday afternoon, CF Industries reported record first quarter net earnings of $368 million or $5.54 per diluted share compared to earnings of $282 million or $3.91 per share in last year's first quarter. We generated these outstanding results, thanks to the confluence of a number of factors. The large number of corn acres already planted and yet to be planted have been driving -- has been a driving force behind strong North American nitrogen plant nutrient demand. Exceptionally mild weather created ideal conditions for farmers who began pre-plant applications earlier than normal. The low level of urea in inventory in North America, coupled with the demand, led to increases in nitrogen prices during the quarter. The continued environment of low-priced North American natural gas provided benefits to our cost structure. These macro factors, combined with excellent execution by our team, were responsible for our outstanding results.","Late in 2011, we didn't believe that then current prices reflected the intrinsic value of our nitrogen products. This belief was based upon our expectation that farmers will plant a large number of acres of corn in 2012, which at the time we expected to be 93.5 million acres. It's clear to us with this level of corn planting, there will be strong, perhaps even record high, demand for nitrogen fertilizer. This belief ultimately was supported by the March USDA prospective plantings report, which reported farmers intention to plant nearly 96 million acres of corn, a number higher than we or most industry observers had anticipated. ","In spite of this anticipated high level of demand, North American industry inventory of nitrogen products, especially urea, was relatively low, even lower than average imports. Urea imports for the fertilizer year through March were estimated to have been down nearly 0.5 million tons or 9% from the prior year. ","Spring application began much earlier than normal this season. In fact, it started before spring arrived on the calendar due to exceptionally mild weather across the Corn Belt. Warm temperatures during March helped create favorable field conditions for farmers to get an early start and pre-plant ammonia applications. Additionally, much needed rain fell in the Southern Plains winter wheat growing areas, providing improved conditions for farmers to apply urea, which many of them had skipped last fall due to dry soil conditions.","The environment then was one of strong demand in low industry-wide inventories of ammonia and urea. When customers finally stepped up to buy, rapid price increases followed as the quarter progressed. Given our production and distribution profile, we were able to take advantage of these favorable market conditions. We used our broad network of production points and distribution and storage assets to make products available when and where they were needed. And in doing so, we met our customers\u2019 needs and benefited our bottom line. As a result, we realized record first quarter sales volumes for ammonia and urea, and we achieved an all-time production record for granular urea.","We saw year-over-year increases in average prices across all of our nitrogen products, although the price realizations were down on a sequential basis. This is not surprising when you remember the very favorable order book we had built before we entered the fourth quarter of 2011. Robust demand that drove our revenue performance was complemented by favorable natural gas cost. ","As one of the major industrial consumers of natural gas, we continue to be beneficiaries of the plentiful and growing supplies of North American shale gas. Natural gas usage in North America was quite low this winter as we experienced the fewest heating degree days in the past 60 years. Lower usage, combined with the continued supply growth, resulted in record inventories and 10-year low natural gas prices. While we did fix 2\/3 of our 2012 gas cost back in December prior to knowing how winter weather would develop, we generated exceptional margins and did realize incremental benefits as gas prices continued to decline.","Our phosphate segment performed reasonably well in the quarter. We saw modest growth in revenues as volume increases more than offset lower prices. Our domestic sales volume was down 18%. Our exports more than tripled compared to last year. Phosphate price realizations decreased from a year ago as dealers appeared to be comfortable with their supply positions and took a \"wait and see at it\" approach to the market. ","We experienced higher sulfur and ammonia costs than a year ago. We completed turnaround work during the quarter at our Plant City, Florida, Phosphate Complex that will benefit us later in the year.","These performance factors helped us generate EBITDA of $702 million, another first quarter record, up from $585 million a year ago. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong with $1.7 billion of cash at quarter end and only $1.6 billion of long-term debt. We're pleased that Moody's recognized our track record of prudent financial management earlier this week by upgrading us to be Baa3 with a positive outlook. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for a few more comments on our financial performance.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2012, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $368 million or $5.54 per diluted share. This compares to $282 million or $3.91 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2012 earnings per share include a non-cash mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $0.52. ","Our nitrogen business had an outstanding first quarter, which you can see on Slide 5. We delivered 3.2 million tons of nitrogen products and achieved a gross margin of 52%. Increased nitrogen gross margin reflects higher sales volumes compared to a year ago, as well as higher average selling prices across every product. ","During the first quarter of 2012, we sold 672,000 tons of ammonia at an average realized price of $598 per ton. Ammonia sales volume for the first quarter of 2012 was 64% higher than a year ago due primarily to the early start of the spring application season. Our average realized sales price for ammonia was 21% higher than in the first quarter of last year. Both agricultural and industrial market prices were higher, and agricultural ammonia was a much higher portion of our sales mix in the first quarter of 2012 than in 2011. ","First quarter sales of granular urea increased by 25% year-over-year to 758,000 tons. Our average realized price of $461 per ton was 24% higher than in the first quarter of 2011. ","During the first quarter, we sold nearly 1.4 million tons of UAN compared to approximately 1.5 million tons in the first quarter of 2011. Average UAN price realizations were $302 per ton, a 9% increase from the first quarter of 2011. Our sales volume was down due to our decision to focus on higher margin urea sales through most of the quarter. However, the average UAN realized price did increase due to sales from an attractive order book entering the quarter and to our capturing the higher market prices at the end of the quarter.","Ammonium nitrate sales of 123,000 tons in the quarter were about 5% lower than in the first quarter of 2011 and prices were 3% higher. ","The average daily market price for natural gas at Henry Hub of $2.46 per MMBtu was $1.70 lower than in the same period last year. Our realized natural gas costs average $3.48 per MMBtu. We continue to have hedge gas positions for approximately 2\/3 of our natural gas usage for the balance of 2012.","As shown on Slide 6, our phosphate segment achieved total revenues during the first quarter of $256 million, up about 3% from the first quarter of 2011. Total sales volume for DAP and MAP was 516,000 tons, 17% higher than in the first quarter of 2011, with domestic volume down 18% from 394,000 to 325,000 tons and export volume up 315% from 46,000 to 191,000 tons. 37% of our phosphate sales was exported in the first quarter of 2012 because of relatively strong buying interest and more attractive net prices outside North America. ","Average phosphate price realizations during the first quarter were about 12% lower than in 2011 due to relatively high industry inventory compared to demand. The phosphate segment generated a 19% gross margin, down from the 33% reported a year ago due to the lower average selling prices and higher raw materials costs. ","We recently entered into a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit facility. Improvements in both the credit market and the company's financial condition have enabled us to negotiate terms for a new facility that are much more favorable than those of the prior facility. We believe the terms of the credit facility indicate the strength of the company's credit book profile as reflected in the Moody's upgrade earlier this week. The new credit facility does not have the restrictive covenants on uses of cash that the prior facility had and provides the company greater flexibility to deploy capital in pursuit of our strategic objectives. ","Finally, although we elected not to repurchase shares during the quarter, the program remains in place. ","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. Nitrogen market conditions are exceptional as we approach the midpoint of the second quarter. Near-term demand for all products is robust, with a large number of corn acres being planted, favorable weather and low industry-wide nitrogen product availability. Corn planting is showing excellent progress with 53% of U.S. corn planted as of April 29 compared to a historic average of 33% for this time of year. ","The ammonia pre-plant season is winding down after an early start with continuous very strong demand. This robust demand has been visible in published spot market prices, and we look forward to a very good side-dress season. The re-application continues at a brisk pace, and we have seen strong UAN demand in recent weeks. ","The last month has been characterized by some nitrogen supply interruptions in North America. While these industry events are quite normal, the impact has been more visible in the market this year due to the tight conditions during 2012. We at CF Industries have met our commitments to customers and believe we're on course for an excellent second quarter.","We expect the global nitrogen fertilizer market to remain in a relatively tight position at least through the first half of the calendar year. Although a significant amount of new capacity is being built globally, several of those projects have been delayed, and we do not expect to see some of them come online until the second half of the year or even later. ","Market dynamics affecting existing producers in high cost regions are keeping the floor price for urea at a high level. The Chinese urea export window is expected to open again in July. However, given the Chinese producers high coal costs and their own domestic fertilizer needs, we expect that China will export less than 3 million tons of urea in 2012, down from an estimated 3.6 million tons in 2011 and 7 million tons in 2010. ","In addition, natural gas cost appear to be rising for some Eastern European producers as Brent crude prices have risen, discounts from Russia have not materialized and alternate supplies of lower cost gas have largely been exhausted. ","Meanwhile, India has significant urea needs and their purchases, along with demand from Latin America and Southeast Asia, did soak up much of the available global urea supply. We anticipate that the phosphate market will continue to improve as the year advances. ","Market is being supported by expectations for strong demand in Latin America as well as the planted area increases due to high soybean prices. India and Southeast Asia also are expected to have strong demand this summer. In the supply side, high production cost may limit Chinese exports of phosphate. ","We will continue to use our production and distribution flexibility to pursue the highest margin sales opportunities, whether domestically or through exports. Additionally, we will seek opportunities to provide upgraded, higher-value products. One of these current opportunities is our introduction of software-enhanced MAP or MAP-S. Earlier this week, we started test runs of this new product. Those tests have started out well, and we anticipate moving to full-scale production before the end of the second quarter. We're very excited about this product, and our customers already have voiced their interest. This is a higher-value product and should provide a modest boost to the earnings potential of our phosphate business. ","Longer term, CF Industries will continue to benefit from several macro market factors to provide -- which provide opportunities for revenue growth and cash flow generation. First, global population growth, rising income levels leading to a shift towards higher protein diets and continued use of grains as a fuel source are all contributing to long-term growths in crop plantings and plant nutrient needs. Secondly, the abundance of natural gas in North America has created attractive cost economics that give us the competitive advantage in the nitrogen market. And finally, at CF Industries, we have a leadership team and a workforce that have proven their ability to deliver on our shareholders expectations by fulfilling our customer's needs. ","These factors provide an exceptional opportunity for CF Industries to continue to create long-term growth in shareholder value, consistent with the view I expressed last quarter, that we believe our nitrogen results will be characterized by higher highs and higher lows going forward. As we have done in recent years, we will apply discipline in developing our cash deployment alternatives. We hope that our shareholders are as pleased as we are with our earnings and cash flow performance and with our prospects. ","With that, let's open the call to your questions. Stacy, could you please explain the Q&A procedures.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess one question is obviously, what do you think happens in the second half of the year on the price side? I think everybody would agree that we saw nitrogen prices in the first half higher than we would have thought 3, 6, 9 months ago. So I guess my question is, do you think that application rates in the U.S. are higher on a per acre basis or combined with the amount of acres that we're planting that maybe you're taking enough supply out of the second half that even if there was a little more incremental capacity, the back half won't be as bad as what maybe what people thought 6 or 9 months ago? And any sort of thoughts on that would be helpful, and then I have a follow-up.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Vince, I'll make just one comment to your last point. I don't think anything about our outlook is bad. Right? I'll just turn the overall question to Bert Frost.","Bert A. Frost","Well, looking at the latter half of the first 6-month period, you have a lot of activity still to take place with various applications on corn and then the continued application of ammonia in the Northern tier, as well as side-dress. And so we're very positive what can and will take place and believe that N applications will be up for the year on $96 million, which is a recent record on acres, as well as the other crops. And we're getting positive rainfall in Texas for -- we're anticipating good demand for the cotton crop, as well as the pivot application in the Western aquifer area. And so that coupled with -- we have to take also into account, world demand to sustain -- we are in a world market -- to sustain world pricing event and what's taking place as you're following India and South America and the limits of exports coming out of China, all really roll up into a very positive period moving forward.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And my follow-up is just, could you talk a little bit -- Steve, you didn't buy stock back in the quarter. The press release talks about being opportunistic. So maybe you could just help us understand what types of things would be considered opportunistic?","Stephen R. Wilson","Sure. With respect to the whole question of cash deployment, I'd like to put a little bit of context around it. We've now been a public company for going on 7 years. I think our record of investment and other cash deployment has been quite positive. And frankly, I'm very proud of it. Going back to 2008, we had an opportunity in front of us to repurchase our shares following the -- at that time of peak in the summer of 2008. We bought stock back in the fall at a very attractive price, $500 million worth of our own stock. Last summer, in August, which is only 8 months ago, our board authorized a comprehensive approach to cash deployment. That included a plan to invest up to $1 billion to $1.5 billion inside the fence in our nitrogen business and to buy up to $1.5 billion of our own stock back. We bought $1 billion worth of that stock back before year end. I think the average price of those shares was around $153 and change. Recently, our stock has been trading in the range of $180 to $200 a share. I think that was a very prudent amount of purchases at a pretty good price. The authorization that was put in place in August 2011 runs through December of 2013. So I'm proud of what we've done both strategically and tactically in this regard. We continue to develop strategy in the future consistent with our good stewardship to date, and the tactics will become visible as we make announcements about actions that have occurred when they occur.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Sandy H. Klugman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","This is Sandy Klugman sitting in for Don. Actually, 2-part question related to the second quarter. As you pointed out, you wisely walked away from some lower price nitrogen business at the end of the year. Your customer advances are up sequentially, but they're still down $350 million year-over-year. So question is, to what extent should investors expect the strong second quarter nitrogen pricing environment to eventually be reflected in your second quarter results? And then you've also talked about how the early start to the application season helped the first quarter volumes. Do you feel that any demand has been pulled forward from the second quarter? I mean, if possible, could you quantify the financial impact on second quarter results?","Stephen R. Wilson","I'll make a comment on your second question, and I'll ask Bert to deal with the pricing question. With respect to volumes, obviously, we had a terrific first quarter in terms of volume, and we were certainly able to sell everything that we can produce. The first quarter was particularly strong in ammonia, and it would be unrealistic for us to think that, for example, we could repeat the ammonia volume we had a year ago because a lot of the pre-plant ammonia is essentially down. Now it's not being applied in the -- in as much in the second quarter as it was a year ago. Now on the other hand, urea -- I'm sorry, UAN is a second quarter product. We have lots of UAN to move, lots of capacity to sell. We're very pleased with our physical position with respect to the UAN market. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, relative to pricing, what you saw in the first quarter was a fairly weak period coming out of the fourth quarter through January and February and then pricing appreciated beginning in March, maybe late February, and has continued to do so through April. And we recognize and, obviously, we have to participate in these environments on a day-to-day basis but believed our story and believed the potential of the high acreage number, and then we priced accordingly for the first quarter. For the second quarter and looking forward, we always say about order book is we're pleased with where we are, and we have products to sell throughout the quarter. The pricing will continue, I think, to be a positive throughout this second quarter period because you've had less exports coming into United States for ammonia and urea, a little higher on UAN today, and high acreage and high application rates. So you can see what's post into some of the publications, probably will trend through a quarter and then begin to weaken for the fill period.","Sandy H. Klugman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. Great. So it sounds like you're happy with your inventory position in UAN. I just want to make sure I'm clear. The recent outages we've been reading about, you don't expect them to have a real impact on second quarter shipments?","Stephen R. Wilson","We were -- as you saw in our press release, our ammonia units ran at the rated capacity in the first quarter. I think absent some kind of problem that's not anticipated at this point, we expect to be very pleased with our production in the first half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on Vincent's question about cash deployment, not at all questioning your track record of good stewardship of capital. You did bring up the example though a couple when you did have the initial buyback authorization, that in 2008, you executed it rather quickly, the full extent of it. And I understand that last year, you were unable to execute the full $1.5 billion because of your credit agreement, but it doesn't seem as if there were any hurdles to buying back stock in the first quarter. Maybe you could just shed a little bit more light on the rationale for waiting to complete the execution of this authorization and, in addition, waiting to deploy capital for the capital investment program that you also announced last year? It sounds like a bunch of that cash deployment is on hold and it would helpful to have a little more color as to why.","Stephen R. Wilson","With respect to the second part of your question, we're on the exact timetable in looking at investment opportunities as we contemplated last August. We have a period here of doing front-end engineering and design work. We have to overlay market studies on that. That will all come together later in the year. And assuming that we have positive decisions, we would expect to be making announcements around the end of the year. That's what we contemplated. I think we actually talked about that in our fourth quarter conference call. And so there has been no change either in our appetite for these projects or on the timetable associated with them. With respect to repurchasing shares, when we announced our buyback in August, we announced it as a $1.5 billion program. We said it had a longevity through the end of 2013. We didn't make any commitments with respect to the pace at which we'd buy back stock. And when we purchase shares, we will let you know at the end of that -- each quarter where we stand.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Bert, maybe just a question for you on UAN, specifically. We haven't seen some capacity expansion in Trinidad. And if you were to paint a scenario where corn prices decline and we get less than this level of record acreage and, ultimately, UAN demand is something that could be fulfilled self-sufficiently without reliance on exports. How would you think about what would set the price floor for UAN and the extent to which urea might be enough of a support factor to keep UAN prices propped up at high levels?","Bert A. Frost","Specifically looking at UAN, world capacity today is far above world demand. And so you do have differentials trading, and it does play off the other products where UAN is relative to urea and ammonia and nitrate also, but where the world producers set their production targets and then where they move the product to various markets. And so we do monitor what's going on in, I guess, the drivers in these other countries relative to gas, demand, production and where they're marketing their products and then what that impact would be on the United States relative to imports and where they import into then, therefore, how we price our products. UAN, what we are -- where we are today is in the logistics market, and so that's where the benefits to CF having in-country production facilities and distribution assets allow us to participate in the spot market and, therefore, capture spot pricing. And so corn today, you can call it 96 million, you can call 92 million, it's still very positive for UAN. So I'm not really anticipating the acreage impact to negatively impact the first 6 months on UAN. Exports, we do -- as you can see in the first quarter, we exported UAN to a few countries. And we continue to use that vehicle as a way to moderate not only our inventories and production rates, but to participate in other markets. And so as we look forward, I think what your question was leading to is the reset price for UAN. The end products today are very positive. As I mentioned earlier, world demand and world S&P scenario is being played out today. And you're going to see that in the India tender for urea really plays well to what is going on with nitrogen. And so I think UAN will set -- reset their positive place and -- but we have to be aware that there's a pretty long carry period for UAN. So that price reset will be at a level that's attractive for an end-user to purchase in-store, and then we will continue to move and produce our products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Neivert with Dahlman Rose.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Couple of quick questions. One, on your customer deposits, it's not a huge number, but can you characterize what time frame those are set in or do they go out to the third or fourth quarter? Are they predominantly for second quarter deliveries? Talk a little bit about that. And also, if there is anything out into the quarters beyond the second, what kind of price differential -- and again, not listing the price, but what kind of differential are you seeing between the current pricing, second quarter pricing and the quarters out beyond that point, if you sold into those quarters already?","Stephen R. Wilson","As a general matter, Charlie, we're very comfortable with our order book position. We're very comfortable what we've seen as it trends in pricing. And beyond that, I don't want to be any more specific. I don't think that's what we do in the normal course.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-on, have you done any 2013 hedging on gas at all?","Stephen R. Wilson","Our gas hedging position is essentially unchanged from the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Maybe as a follow-up on the last question. I know you've given the same guidance for your gas hedge for the rest -- for 2012. Maybe you could speak about if you hedged more than that for Q1? And also if you could give a little bit color right now what you think of sort of your gas position and what types of spreads we should be thinking at some of the benchmarks like Henry Hub and AECO to get an idea of what we can track?","Stephen R. Wilson","Joel, I'm not sure I understood your first question there. Can I....","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Oh, I'm sorry. On Q1, if you could give a little color on what amount of your gas was hedged?","Stephen R. Wilson","Going into the first quarter, we had hedged roughly 2\/3 of our natural gas for the full year. And it was not exactly pro rata through the year, but it was close to that.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Was it a little bit higher or lower? Can you...","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, it was approximately pro rata all the way through the year. And your second question was about basis differential and natural gas?","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","How we should think about the gas, please?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we normally have an advantageous position in -- at Medicine Hat. We normally have an advantageous position at our Oklahoma plants. We normally have an advantageous position at Courtright, Ontario. And I think our Port Neal facility is generally less than Henry Hub. Donaldsonville, of course, is right on top of Henry Hub. Did I miss anybody? Those numbers move around, but they're, I think, pretty widely available in publications.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And finally, in the quarter, obviously, the U.S. under imported urea for the end of Q4 and a little bit in Q1. Can you maybe speak about some of your gain in the quarter beyond just some of the mild weather and the big acres? But some of it came from market share pickup here because of the under importation. Maybe quantify it, if you can?","Stephen R. Wilson","We ship as much product as we make, and we're able to sell it. Bert, anything you want to add to that?","Bert A. Frost","Just relative to market share, I would look at it on a 5-year import average for urea or the other products and then compare. And urea was under imported in 2012 relative to the 5-year average. And there -- I think that drives a bit of the supply and demand imbalance that we experienced in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Steve, 2 questions. You talked about how many more corn acres there are versus your original expectations when you set some of your targets. Do you still think 96 million acres is the right way for us to be thinking about things, given the way you're seeing the market develop and corn going to ground? And second question, KEYTRADE was a small -- relatively small deal with relatively large strategic impact. I'm curious whether global fertilizer distribution is on your wish list when you think about capital allocation opportunities?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. With respect to corn acreage, our internal view on corn acres is just a little bit less than the USDA, which is 95.3 million. At this point, all we know is that a lot of corn is being planted. Whether we get to 96 million, I don't think anybody knows it at this point. But given the amount of nitrogen that's moving, it's going to be a pretty big number. We're very -- obviously, very pleased with our KEYTRADE relationship. In fact, KEYTRADE is celebrating their 15th anniversary as a company this weekend. We haven't been with them quite all that time. KEYTRADE is in the trading business, not in the distribution business. So fertilizer distribution around the world is a very different business. We're very comfortable with our position as a manufacturer, mostly manufacturing for the domestic market, but accessing the world markets when it's appropriate for us to do so. I would not say that we would never consider that, but that's not something that's prominent on our radar screen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First off, I thought I heard that you mentioned that ammonia volumes might be down year-over-year in the second quarter. If that's the case, do you expect urea patterns to be very similar in the second quarter?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, the ammonia situation is characterized, I think, in the following way. A year ago, we had a huge second quarter in ammonia and a fairly weak first quarter. This year, we had a huge first quarter. And given that there is roughly the same amount of land to which direct application ammonia is applied, then I think it's a reasonable expectation for ammonia to be down in the second quarter compared to a year ago. For us, we don't really care whether it's in the first quarter or the second quarter. We're in the middle of a huge nitrogen demand pattern in the first half of the year. And so we expect a huge UAN movement, weather-permitting, in the second quarter. And I think it's also important to note that we've had rising prices. And if you look at year-over-year prices, market prices right now are stronger than they were a year ago. We're going to sell -- again, weather-permitting, we're going to sell everything we can make. We're going to be testing our ability to sweep the floors of our warehouses and drain product from our tanks. And we welcome the challenge of doing that.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay. My second question, we've heard from some of the potash producers that distributors have been more cautious in restocking inventory levels. Post-spring planting, can you just give us some color on some of the initial conversations that you're having with your distributors and whether you're seeing the same cautiousness on the nitrogen side?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. Tim, I'll make a general comment, and then Bert may want to add to it. Every year is different. And following the problems of 2008, a lot of people down the chain became reticent to making commitments, and rightfully so, because they got burned. That reticence actually was in full display end of 2011 and end of 2012. And what I think a number of customers are experiencing now is lack of having made commitments as translated into either late availability or difficulty in getting commitments from producers. And so my general belief is that there'll be some moderation of this view coming out of this year. There may be incremental willingness to commit earlier than was the case this past winter. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","I think where we are in inventory, we're into drawdown period for all the products. And so it's natural that we would trend at the end of the quarter -- the second quarter to low inventory. And I think part of this is good decision-making on the distribution channel to moderate their purchases, to manage their risk, which is managing their inventory and be prepared for the reset period. But also, that moves into, I think, our sweet spot of logistics, where we're active on all modes of transport of the end products. And so I think it's going to be a positive position for CF going forward on the reset.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just, Steve, quickly on your hedging strategy on a higher level. Is there a maximum amount of exposure that you can hedge and is 2\/3 the max you can go? And is there any change in your strategy in terms of hedging?","Stephen R. Wilson","In general, there's been no change in our strategy towards hedging. We ended up taking some positions in excess of what had become traditional for us at the end of 2011 because the market gave us that opportunity. It is our maximum -- well, clearly, the technical maximum is what our production is, how many ammonia molecules do we need translated back into MMBtus of gas. From a more practical standpoint, we would obviously want to leave a little bit of room for unplanned outages and so forth so that we didn't overcommit. And frankly, I think we like being in the spot market to a meaningful extent in a market like we just had. So every day is different in a commodity business, and we will continue to evaluate. Our committee will meet and get together. But our overall philosophy of hedging has really not changed.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, good. And secondly, any thoughts on new nitrogen capacity in the U.S.? It looks like some brownfield capacity is getting delayed. And then anything on this Orascom plant that is proposed in Iowa?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I don't know any more about that particular plant than I've read about. I think anybody who is contemplating building ammonia capacity in the U.S. should have a pretty good grasp on the environmental challenges associated with building that capacity and, obviously, that includes ourselves. And whether that ever got -- would get built, I don't know. But I think in today's environment, with respect to environment, it would be a challenge. In our particular case, we are sitting in a pretty good position because of all the plant sites we have, all the infrastructure we have and our own experience in expanding production on a brownfield basis. So the projects that we are contemplating in this $1 billion to $1.5 billion that we may spend will be quite lower cost than greenfield capacity, in the range of, let's say, 1\/3 to 1\/2 the capital cost of new capacity. That's a great position to be in. We can do that relatively quickly. We would phase it in constant with -- in concert with our normal turnaround schedule. But it is really -- it's a set of high-return, low-risk projects that we're really hopeful we can undertake.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Rystrom with Feltl.","Brent R. Rystrom - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First one would have to do with kind of seasonality. I'm assuming, given how wet it was last spring, that a lot of the side-dressing pushed off into July compared to the more typical June. And I'm wondering if you see a 3Q pull into 2Q because of that? And then I know a lot of farmers are focused on harvesting corn as quickly as possible given how tight the carry out is and then the inverted basis on corn, particularly, in kind of the key ethanol refining states where premiums are $1, say, per bushel over the cash price. Do you feel that the ammonia application typical in the fourth quarter might get pulled a little in the third quarter? That would be the first question.","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert, do you want to talk about the seasonality on UAN?","Bert A. Frost","Well, I'll hit them with the side-dress. Yes, what you're going to see -- what we're seeing is -- and you can see it in the published planting speed that's going on, obviously, you're going to have an earlier -- as we've all said, an earlier crop in the ground, which would then push forward the side-dress season. And so we're anticipating here in a few weeks probably in the lower half of the United States that the side-dress for ammonia would take place, and UAN will be a little bit later in the Northern tier. Iowa has a little bit later planting than Illinois. And your second part on harvesting early and then possible early application of ammonia, that will depend on soil temperatures and the right application periods. So yes, the corn could come off early. Let's say, it's in the ground 3 to 4 weeks early, so you might pull the harvest 3 to 4 weeks early, which would be nice if it dried out by December -- or by September. But we would anticipate that ammonia then being -- that they would do the fieldwork to prepare for ammonia, that would only probably commence in late October.","Brent R. Rystrom - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","You need the 50 degrees, basically?","Bert A. Frost","Correct.","Brent R. Rystrom - Feltl and Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then final question. Can you give any sense of how much of your expected 2Q sales were exposed to spot pricing at the start of the quarter for nitrogen?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we're in the market every day. Bert's people are answering the phone. In general, there's been a lag in spot prices showing up in our order book and our shipments, but we're very comfortable with our position in all of our products with respect to the margins that are in that book.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper Jaffray.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was hoping you could quantify the turnaround cost at the Florida facility and what sort of benefits we might be able to expect in the second half?","Stephen R. Wilson","We do turnarounds on an ongoing basis. It's just part of our normal routine. The benefits of doing a turnaround are, we keep the facility in tip-top shape, operating to its capability and prolong its life.","Bert A. Frost","The other thing that we did was we moved the turnaround out of later in the year to earlier in the year, partly because of the soft nature of the market opportunity that was there. So we took an outage during the period of soft demand. So we'll have production capacity online later in the year, where we believe pricing will be more supportive.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And on the topic of cash deployment, I'd be curious as to the thought process of a comprehensive strategy when you do unveil your plans for that $1 billion to $1.5 billion capital project. Would that be a time when we could potentially expect a broader platform of how to expect use of cash at CF over time?","Stephen R. Wilson","When we have comments to make about deployment of cash, we'll be making them. That's all I have to say on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella","This is Chris Perrella on for Kevin. One question -- or 2 questions. But did you have a free hand in buying back shares during the first quarter or are there any factors that it precluded you from coming to the market?","Stephen R. Wilson","Chris, I think on our fourth quarter conference call, we made it clear that the basket had been refreshed under our revolver, and we're free to go.","Christopher Perrella","Okay. And then as a follow-up, do you expect at the fill season here after the spring application is over for more normal inventory restocking? Things have been tight. Do you expect more people to step back in and top off at the end of the spring?","Bert A. Frost","We expect normal behavior. Inventory will be very low for at least 2 of the 3 nutrients. That would be N and P. And so we were anticipating actually probably heavy purchasing because -- then you get into a logistical situation where you can only move so many railcars of UAN and the pipe can only handle so much ammonia up through. And then also, we'll be participating in the international market because we do see heavy demand for phosphate in South America. And we'll be monitoring India to see if we need to participate or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You had a wonderful first quarter, and it looks like you'll have a wonderful year. And so the company probably has much more financial flexibility than you might have imagined that you would have. Does that open up various acquisition opportunities for you, either in North America or offshore, that you might not have looked at as carefully?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, thanks for that question. That's a nice question to have. We have a very good window to the world. We hear a lot of opportunities. We will normally look at any opportunity that pops up in front of us. On the M&A front, if something were to come along as attractive, we certainly wouldn't hesitate to consider it. We have been -- 3 years ago, Jeff, we were in a position -- maybe 4 years ago, of absolutely needing to diversify away from North America, and that was an objective for us. As shale gas developed this country, our existing asset base became more valuable. It certainly has reinforced the value of the Terra acquisition. So our -- we're comfortable with our North American profile today. And we -- I think it's safe to say that given our disciplined nature, that the fact that we have more jingle on our pocket doesn't make us any less disciplined in our deployment of cash.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I didn't mean to imply that you would be less disciplined. I just wondered...","Stephen R. Wilson","I understood. I just felt that I should make that comment in light of the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Steve, just one quick question for you, maybe as a follow-up to Jeff's. When I think about the potential transfer of ownership of the 34% stake in Medicine Hat that you don't own, can you give us some color as to what extent CF is involved in that process? Does CF have a first -- sorry, a right of first refusal on the asset?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Ben, just as a matter of prudence, we don't comment on announced pending transactions by other people.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Okay. But given the agreement that exists between CF and by Terra, historically, has there been a right of first refusal?","Stephen R. Wilson","As I said, we don't comment on pending transactions announced by other people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Picken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I guess a couple of questions. One is, why has urea imports been down year-on-year if the expectation among the market was that we were going to see increase in corn acres? Could you talk a little bit about that?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","We've had several factors impacting movement of urea, and we had some difficult markets. If you look back over the previous years, we've had a collapse of pricing in March and April. And so those who imported early were punished for that decision. And so I think with -- if you watch what the traders and the producers, a lot of this product are shipped in by producers direct and then put on barge. I think they were playing a more prudent hand, looking for more spot purchases or sales around the world. And also, the China impact, we had probably 1 million tons come in to the United States in January -- December and January a few years ago, and that product is basically nonexistent this year. So when you factor all that in, a few plant problems around the world, the new capacities do not come online, less available and the risk of the forward market, I think people -- again the traders and producers were just acting more in a short-term interest.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Great. And then just shifting gears real quick. Do you guys have sort of a target, like optimal either leverage ratio or debt-to-cap ratio or -- and debt to EBITDA or however you look at it, but is there sort of kind of as you think out to the long term, where you'd like to see your leverage ratios at?","Stephen R. Wilson","Dennis?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, I guess, in the past, Steve, I think we said 1x EBITDA or 1 point. And I think, as you can imagine, given where we are in the cycle right now, you can see that we're significantly below that, which is sort of what you'd expect. I don't have any particular target level of debt in mind for the company. I think I would just go back to what Steve said, which is we have to look out and see kind of the environment that we're facing in going forward and take a judgment as to what's the best way to capitalize the company, given all the strategic opportunities and whatever that we have in front of us. So I don't have any particular target in mind. But at this point in time, obviously, we're well below what we had stated before. But given where we are in the cycle, I think that you'd expect that.","Stephen R. Wilson","I would add just want thought to that, and that is to follow up on the Moody's upgrade we had this week. We think we've had investment grade credit statistics for a long time. And so generally, my view there over the long period, we ought to maintain investment grade and an investment grade credit profile. Whether that results in investment grade rating or not is out of our control, but what is in control is our own capital structure.","Operator","And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Dan Swenson for closing remarks.","Dan Swenson","We'd like to thank everyone here who participated on the call today.

Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted fourth quarter and full year results for 2015. For the fourth quarter, CF Industries generated EBITDA of $254 million and full year EBITDA of $1.7 billion. After taking into account hedging losses and impairment loss on our Trinidad joint venture equity investment, costs related to both the CHS Strategic Venture and the OCI Transaction, and expenses related to the expansion projects, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $2 billion.","Despite difficult market conditions, we generated gross margin of over 25% in the fourth quarter and over 35% for the year. If not for the unrealized mark-to-market losses of roughly $100 million on natural gas hedges, our gross margin for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 34%. And if not for the unrealized mark-to-market loss of approximately $175 million, our gross margin for the full year was roughly 40%.","Our quarterly and full year results continue to demonstrate the cash generating capability of this company. We consistently deliver solid results because of our cost advantage position within the industry, despite the fact that the global fertilizer market is oversupplied.","In several production regions of the world, currency devaluations and other factors have reduced costs for high-cost producers, some of which have continued to run despite negative margins, leading to excess supply. As a result, there has been downward pressure on prices. Urea transactions have been reported at price levels not seen in the decade. However, even against this backdrop, we still delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion.","Our business is not like other commodities. It shares little to nothing with iron, steel, copper or coal. A country or region with a slowing economy may stop building skyscrapers, ships and highways, but its people still need to eat. Global nitrogen demand remains strong and growing. To be sure, there is excess supply, but we occupy the lowest cost position in the industry and continue to generate significant cash.","All commodities are not created equal and it is critically important to keep a perspective on the underlying fundamentals of our business as distinct from others. First, several weeks ago there were reports of urea trading in the U.S. Gulf at or below $200 per short ton. While some business was done at this level, the volume was extremely thin because these prices were well below the replacement cost for the marginal producers.","As we suspected all along, available volume was scarce and just two weeks later, urea is now reported trading in the range of $250 per ton, up more than 25% from the beginning of February. Second, we have seen a decrease in both Chinese exports and urea plant operating rates. The most recent industry publications for the Chinese fertilizer market indicate that operating rates for coal-based urea producers have declined to 66% in January from 73% in December. While that may not sound like a large amount, this seven point drop in Chinese operating rates equates to a reduction of approximately 6 million tons of urea on an annual basis. These facts suggest to us that previously published prices are not sustainable.","Third, even at the $200 per ton price trough published in January, a typical U.S. Gulf producer of urea generates roughly 50% cash margins. This is driven by low cost North American natural gas providing us the sustainable advantage versus producers in other regions further bolstered by the import-dependent nature of North America. So, it should be obvious that the sky is not falling, that nitrogen is not like other commodities, and that our business remains highly attractive and continues to generate significant cash.","Turning to our strategic initiatives, we have made significant progress and are now in full delivery mode. Since our last earnings call, we amended our announced business combination with OCI's European, North American and global trading and distribution businesses to incorporate in and become a tax resident of the Netherlands. We expect to close this transaction in the middle of 2016. We commenced our strategic venture with CHS, receiving a $2.8 billion payment and have begun shipping product under the supply agreement.","We have also entered the final stages of our capacity expansion projects. The Donaldsonville urea plant has been in production since November of last year. The UAN plant is mechanically complete and in the process of being commissioned. And we expect the welding and piping work on the ammonia plant, which represents the majority of the remaining work and cost, to be completed within the next eight weeks.","We also expect Port Neal to be mechanically complete in the second quarter of 2016, meaning all of our spending on these projects will very soon be behind us. The total costs for both projects remains in line with our previous estimates and similarly our projected returns for the projects have not changed.","I'll now turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter. And then, I'll wrap up with some perspectives on strategy and the longer term outlook. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Thanks, Tony. The global nitrogen market continues to be supply-driven, with increased availability of internationally sourced product pressuring prices. During the fourth quarter, prices for all fertilizer products declined, including nitrogen. Excess supply around the world and new capacity coming online, all helped to push the market lower. Urea prices declined throughout the quarter, decreasing from a high of $260 per short ton fob NOLA at the beginning of the quarter to $220 per short ton fob NOLA at the end of the quarter.","As Tony said, very little business was done at these low levels, as the market was highly illiquid. During the fourth quarter, the Chinese government allowed the yuan to devalue further, continuing a trend that began in the third quarter of 2015. When accounting for the devaluation, along with a decrease in coal prices and continued weakness in ocean freight, cash costs of urea production for the marginal Chinese anthracite coal-based producer are now estimated to be near the seasonal low of roughly $225 per short ton delivered to the U.S. Gulf.","As Tony mentioned, production rates in China are declining and some high-cost producers have already curtailed production or shut down altogether. Exports out of China were 1.5 million tons lower in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. For the full year 2015, exports totaled approximately 13.8 million tons, which is slightly higher than the full year 2014.","In the U.S., industrial ammonia demand was impacted by lower phosphate production and the fourth quarter agricultural ammonia application season was negatively impacted by weather. Warm weather into early November, coupled with the combination of rain and snow later that month, limited most of the Midwest from getting applications completed.","In addition, customers were reluctant to buy urea and UAN during much of the fourth quarter due to the prospect of lower prices in the future. So weather-related disruption of the fourth quarter ammonia application season, along with delayed purchases of UAN and urea during the fourth quarter, should lead to a larger than average spring demand and a corresponding rebound in prices, as nitrogen fertilizer must be applied on an annual basis.","Ahead of spring, the company is well positioned with inventory prepared to serve key markets. Nitrogen fertilizer demand in North America is expected to remain steady in 2016 compared to 2015. Current projected returns for the 2016 crop, based on new crop futures, continue to favor corn plantings over soybeans. As a result, 2016 corn planting is expected to reach approximately 90.5 million acres, which is a 2.5 million acre increase from 2015.","North American natural gas continues to provide the company a substantial cost advantage compared to other global producers. The North American natural gas market began the fourth quarter of 2015 with minimal price movement and lower volatility. However, that quickly turned into a sharp downward shift in prices in the latter half of October.","Stronger than expected El Ni\u00f1o conditions brought warmer weather that continued through much of the quarter and was a large contributor to the significant decrease in gas demand. Natural gas consumption in North America for residential and commercial uses during the fourth quarter of 2015 was 16% lower than the end of the fourth quarter of 2014. Despite the continued decrease in rig count, gas production continued at record levels during the fourth quarter and the storage balance in North America reached a record level of 4 trillion cubic feet at the end of the injection season.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bert. In the fourth quarter, we generated $254 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were approximately a $98 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on our natural gas hedges, a $62 million loss for an impairment of our PLNL joint venture equity investment, $20 million in transaction costs related to the OCI Transaction and the CHS Strategic Venture, $15 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities, and a $3 million loss on our foreign currency hedges.","When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $451 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.76. For the year, we generated $1.7 billion of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $2.96. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $3.88.","Our realized natural gas cost for the quarter was $3.07 per MMBtu and consisted of purchased natural gas of $2.66 per MMBtu and a realized loss of $0.41 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our natural gas cost has declined by 25% when compared with fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year 2015, our realized natural gas cost was also $3.07 per MMBtu, a 28% reduction compared to 2014.","During the fourth quarter, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges. The company completed a review of its equity method investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited, PLNL, our 50% investment in an ammonia production joint venture located in The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago. This review assessed the recoverability of the company's carrying value of the investment.","During the fourth quarter of 2015, the company recognized an impairment charge of $62 million relating to its investment in PLNL due to continuing gas curtailments from the government controlled gas supplier, and the expectation is that these curtailments will continue.","On December 18, 2015, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes, PATH Act was signed into law and applies to tax years 2015 through 2019. One of the provisions of the Act permits companies to deduct 50% of their capital expenditures for federal income tax purposes in the year qualifying assets were placed into service. As a result of this provision, for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company recorded a federal tax receivable of approximately $120 million that is expected to result in a tax refund. This receivable is primarily associated with the new urea plant and related offsites that were placed into service at the company's Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex during November of 2015.","In 2016, the company expects to place into service the new UAN and ammonia plants at Donaldsonville and the new urea and ammonia plants at Port Neal. Most of these assets will also qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service in 2016, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.","For the full year 2015, our total capital expenditures were approximately $2.5 billion. This consists of approximately $1.7 billion for the capacity expansion projects, plus approximately $600 million of sustaining improvement and other capital expenditures, and $155 million of capitalized interest.","For 2016, the company expects to have capital expenditures of approximately $1.8 billion, of which $1.2 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects and $600 million will be for sustaining improvement and other projects.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move on to Q&A, I wanted to review our near and longer term outlook and the significant benefits of our strategic initiatives.","As we have already discussed, our business continues its strong operating performance, delivering $2 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015. Looking at the fundamentals, the cash margins for North American producers are in the 50% to 60% range even with today's market conditions.","Against this healthy backdrop, over the next roughly six months, we are about to grow significantly, adding 60% new production capacity to our portfolio with very similar margin structures to our current business. We are investment grade and have a very strong balance sheet, having just received $2.8 billion in cash.","Our spending on the capacity expansion projects is quickly coming to an end, as we expect to be fully mechanically complete within the second quarter. Our business combination with OCI is expected to deliver roughly $500 million annually in after-tax full run rate benefits. And we expect our longer term effective tax rate to drop from 35% into the low 20%s, making us that much more efficient at converting EBITDA into cash.","Finally, bonus depreciation will provide us significant cash flow benefit this year. The bright future we've been talking about is arriving now. This is a lot of very positive change all being delivered in a short period of time.","However, one thing is constant through it all and that is our focused strategy for driving total shareholder returns. Our goal is to grow cash generation per share and our capital allocation philosophy flows from that. We first look to grow our cash generation, the numerator in the equation. We do that with investments that have risk adjusted rates of return well above our cost of capital and only if they drive cash flow per share accretion. Otherwise, we look to reduce our outstanding share count, thereby reducing the denominator in the equation.","Consistent with our past actions, all excess cash will be returned to shareholders, but we are fully committed to maintaining our solid investment grade credit rating. As we look forward, we believe there will be significant cash available for deployment. We will do that consistent with our singular goal of growing cash generation per share just like we have in the past.","I want to end today's call by thanking all of our employees who have worked so hard, not only on all of our strategic initiatives, but also keeping the core CF business running so strongly on a daily basis, while delivering our best ever safety performance, a truly remarkable accomplishment. Many of the steps we have taken are already showing results and I am excited that the next six months should see all of our initiatives, move from planning and development into actually delivering cash flow to the bottom line.","With that, we'll now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. You may begin.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Carl Chen stepping in for Ben. Thank you for taking my question. So we have seen an incredible rally in the urea prices over the past weeks owing to the prospect of an early spring. Can you please also comment on your expectation for the strength of the ammonia and the UAN pricing recovery, given that Mosaic decided to curtail that production in Q1, and this early spring could reduce the need for UAN side-dressing?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Carl, I'm going to ask Bert to take that question. But just one observation, when you talk about an incredible rally in urea, I mean the observation I think that a lot of us around the table would make is that the trough pricing that was reported in January was a little bit artificial. It doesn't really reflect where the market has any kind of liquidity or volume. And that's one of the reasons why it looks like it'd come back because the minute there was any sort of demand it rebounded to what the real value of the product is. But, Bert, do you want to handle the -","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","No, I agree with you about the urea market. It has recovered probably to more of a normal price range. And I think we have an anomaly like you said, very few barges were traded at those lower levels. And we know that because we entered the market to buy a few and they were not there.","I do anticipate we are seeing now probably the opportunity for an early spring. Applications have already begun in the Southwest, Texas, Oklahoma, and the temperatures this weekend are very conducive to continue that activity. And I think as you see that warming trend move through drying trend, throughout the Midwest, I would think that within a month in the upper Midwest, that being Nebraska, Iowa, we may even see applications beginning then.","You're correct that a lot of the ammonia stays within the producers hands and is available to the customers, those being the retailers, which then sell to the farmers for application. And I think the order trend has been a little bit different than in previous years, but the feedback we're getting from our customers is that there will be significant demand. We lost a lot of ammonia applications in the fall just due to the weather issues we articulated and so that \u2013 and it will still be needed to be applied. And so as you move that to spring, we're going to need almost a record ammonia season in order to fill some of that nitrogen demand, which I think will be difficult.","And so for your comment on UAN, we believe that's going to fall either to urea or both the urea and UAN. And we're positioning our products and our terminals with our customers for that eventuality that we're seeing a pretty healthy market going forward for nitrogen on the demand side and a parallel positive position for pricing going into and through spring and even on the back half.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. And then, maybe just a follow-up question. We have seen some reports indicate that Chinese urea producers are producing below costs and stockpiling in the anticipation of a strong spring application similar to last year. If this spring application disappoints in China, do you have a sense of how this residual inventory could weight on urea prices abroad?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Today, the indications we're getting out of China are that the terminal and the port inventories are lower than normal. And that makes economic sense. As what we said in the comments was we believe that the Chinese producers, a majority of them, have been operating at or below costs. There is very little incentive for them to push products to the ports. So we're seeing the Chinese industry operate rationally. And according to economic principles, eventually gravity does work even in China.","And so, when you look at today what's going on in China, wheat top-dress has begun in China and you're seeing product move into those markets. Today, the domestic price is better and there the incentive then is for the Chinese producer, the urea producer, to keep that product moving to the interior. And then, they'll probably look to the export market as we move through spring.","Today, if you loaded a Chinese vessel, let's say March 1, and we're sending that to the United States to New Orleans, it would probably be a 45 day voyage and then discharge arriving in mid to late April, and you're starting to get a little bit late. There have been some Chinese vessels sold for this spring and we think they'll arrive in late March through early April. But once you get past April, it's difficult to have that product be applied for the spring and post planting season.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. You may begin.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Bert, do you have an estimate of how much nitrogen inventory is in the retail channel now? And how does that compare to historical levels for mid-February?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah, Steve, good morning. It is a little bit anecdotal, but we do spend a lot of time trying to determine what the physical inventory position is, whether that'd be dry on urea or UAN in the tanks. Most of the ammonia is sitting with us or the other producers in the terminal system throughout the Midwest. And so, what we know just based on imports and production levels of UAN, we expect that those levels are lower than historical due to the fact that we trended into fertilizer year 2016 at a low level of inventory entering that season and then the production and imports together with that build our number.","On urea, I think there's a sufficient inventory to begin the season. You can look at the import numbers and then, again, at the production numbers and our production numbers. So there is enough probably in position, but is in the right position, and then the second round of product that needs to be available. And I think that's why you've seen this rally is the scramble to get product in position.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And how would you characterize those customers of yours? Are they fully engaged now in rebuilding inventory for what you described as that second round or some of them still on the sidelines?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","It's like a family. Everybody has a different opinion when you sit around and talk politics, same thing about inventory on fertilizer. We've just participated in a TFI and met with a majority of our customers and we had the whole range of opinions of, I'm not going to buy until the farmer comes in to purchase and they'll pay the appropriate price at that time to those who have prepared and we're anticipating. And so we're working with each of our customers at their risk level or their risk appetite, and some of that inventory has stayed with us and we're quite fine with that because we believe in the size of this spring application season and the need for this product will be probably very robust.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a question on the UAN market, if I will, I mean, you've had a pretty big spike in urea in the last 10 days or so. And I know, Tony, you said, hey, that was depressed in January and there's very little volume there, but at the same time the UAN market trended down in conjunction with urea. And if I look at spot pricing, I would say that urea is trading at a premium on an end value basis to UAN, which seems unusual. And so I'm trying to think about, A, how your order book on UAN looks prospectively, given there's less dependence on imports there? And B, how you think about the balance between the two products on an end value basis as we go into the spring?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah, good morning, Adam. You did see a movement in UAN in January. We readjusted or adjusted our prices at that point, but the urea market stayed very steady July through into January. And there was a reflection on an end basis at that time to move UAN more in line with urea. But as you've seen urea move up, we've seen a demand build for UAN and we believe that will continue through spring. UAN's a great product. It's so versatile and how it can be used, not only in wheat and corn. And so, I do believe that you're going to see a price increase or a value increase going into spring for UAN as well.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And as you look at your own order book today versus prior years on UAN, would you say you're ahead of last year, behind last year, or any comments there?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah, every year is different. And so it's more of you can be ahead or behind them, I'm not sure if that's as meaningful as what the value associated with the product and the gas price. So we're pretty excited about the level that we're able to buy our feedstock. And I would think that at these lower levels, it's not as attractive to us to sell. And so we would prefer to wait for some appreciation.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. I was just wondering if you could speak about some of the inputs you're assuming to build up to the marginal cost figure of $225 per short ton, specifically in terms of anthracite coal prices, freight? And also, can you just talk about how these inputs have changed from your 3Q estimate of marginal cost of $250 to $285 per short ton?","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure, Neel, this is Dennis Kelleher. I'm just trying to get to this slide that you're talking about here in the deck. What we've done here is basically what we look at is, basically all of the costs that exist at the plant site, and that includes cost to ship the coal to it, the costs at the plant sites that are incurred and the cost to ship that product to the port, and then, obviously, to load it so that it can be loaded on the boat and shipped to the U.S. Gulf. So all of those inputs, sort of from the coal mine all the way through to the product arriving at the U.S. Gulf, are included here.","And what we do is, on a regular basis, we're going to update that for everything from Chinese exchange rates to Chinese coal costs in addition to that to freight rates, and we do this across the curve. And so what's happened, if you look at sort of where we've come to is you've seen a decline in coal prices, but you've also seen a decline in the RMB exchange rate, and we've also seen a decline in shipping rates. And so that's what accounts for sort of the shift to downward in what we call the seasonal floor price range.","And I want to be clear that this is a seasonal floor price range because we're saying it's $225 to $270. And what we do perhaps differently from the way other producers look at it is, we look at the fluctuations in monthly off-take for urea. And so during low periods, you'll see lower prices like we've seen here in January and February. And then, during high periods, like when you get into the spring, it takes more dollars to bid the more expensive marginal producers into the market. But that's basically how we do this. We look at each of the bars here in the cost curve and we will update that.","With respect to China, we've got a lot of insight because of studies that we've done on a plant-by-plant basis. And so, we will update the cost on a plant-by-plant basis for the various subsets of their producers.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","But to be specific, we're assuming $115 per metric ton (31:41) coal and using RMB exchange rate of $6.55.","(31:49)","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So that's $6.51this morning.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's pretty helpful. And there's a quick second question. I was just wondering if your thinking has changed at all in terms of target leverage. I know previously you had mentioned 2 to 2.5 times.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","On the leverage front, we're still 2 to 2.5 times. I think as we get through the OCI transaction and reduce our effective tax rate, you could argue that the same amount of EBITDA actually goes farther because we're much more efficient at converting EBITDA into cash. So you can see maybe another half turn of additional leverage that we could take on, so somewhere in the 2 to 3 times range, I think, is probably reasonable, but we haven't socialized that necessarily with all of the rating agencies and so forth. And our view is always, we want to maintain solid investment grade rating, but have an efficient balance sheet. So we're going to thread the needle on those two constraints.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. I wonder if you could give a couple of updates on methanol and the Natgasoline project. Where are you in your thoughts on that commodity and if that is something you want to keep in the deal? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Good morning, Joel. So, as we've talked about in the past, there is a closing condition for Natgasoline that it has project financing. It is a very difficult project financing marketplace out there right now. And so in the last, that was able to satisfy the closing condition or we otherwise wave it, then Natgasoline would be excluded from the deal.","So we're not in a position right now where it's a decision time on any of that, but the closing conditions are pretty clearly spelled out. That's one of the reasons, the lack of project financing was one of the reasons along with comments that we received from the SEC that in the last S-4 filing that we made, which you saw, was an assumption that Natgasoline was not part of the deal, with a footnote that said it could be included. And that reflects just the status of financing on that project.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Thank you for that. And a couple of updates, can you talk about Verdigris, some of the outages there? And also, there are a lot of trade general reports that perhaps as the new capacity at D'ville's come up, there's been some issues with that production. Are there any issues that you could speak of? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","We're very happy with the new plant at Donaldsonville. It's running well. And, look, I don't know how people drew that conclusion that the plant isn't running well. I think as Bert mentioned, we saw where pricing was trading on urea and thought, hey, at that level we're buyers not sellers. So, our decision to go in and grab a few barges had nothing to do with production problems. It was all about intrinsic value of the product versus where it was trading. So, Chris, I'll let you talk about it.","Christopher D. Bohn - Senior Vice President, Manufacturing","Yeah. And on the Verdigris, we have an ammonia plant. When we were doing the turnaround last year on the ammonia plant, we saw that we needed to replace some of the internals and catalysts. And that's the work that we're doing right now on that plant.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","It's just some routine maintenance that we're taking care of.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna. You may begin.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Just question your forward order book, I noticed your customer advances were down almost 50% in dollar terms year-over-year. I assume your forward order book volumes were down even more. And Tony, you made references to some barges you were buying because of intrinsic value. It seems you've been more aggressive in buying out barges this year where you think the price is attractive. Is that an accurate assessment?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Well, I'd say, Don, that we have not really done that historically. And so, even if were we to buy one or two barges, that would be by definition more aggressive than we've been in the past, but we just looked at the numbers and said this price makes no sense. And we were \u2013 we have more than enough demand to accommodate us bringing on some barges. So we were in the mode of wanting to vacuum some of that up. I'll ask Bert to comment on the forward order book.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Couple of things on the forward order book. When \u2013 just on the overall price differentials for this spring compared to last spring, you've seen probably $100 per product change. So that's just on the aggregate dollar terms you mentioned. But having a forward order book or not having a forward book to me is a reflection of your view of the market. We are interested in selling forward. We have a plant and logistical assets that we need to maintain and move. So, there is an incentive, and matter of fact there is a requirement to make sure that that happens.","However, that's also compared or contrasted against what the market is offering and the view that we think the market's going to improve. So, the incentive to have a forward order book in January and December just wasn't there. And, we have the capability to hold that product in inventory or change the production mix or export product. And so, we were able to maintain and move through those periods a lot better than I think we used to. And that's what you're seeing, to me, is reflected in that number rather than a desire to be out there to build the order book at lower prices.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","So, most of this recent price fly up should be realized as you go forward in contrast to last year where you had locked in more forward business?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah. I'll let you make that decision, but we think the spring is going to be positive.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Korn with Barclays. You may begin.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody. Let me ask this, what right now are the most opportune export markets for you today, both in geography and product? Wondering if the disarray in Brazil has allowed there for any development for foundations of a UAN market down there. And then, just in terms of housekeeping, how much product that you actually send offshore this past quarter and this past year?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah. So, when you look at the export markets, it's the marginal ton or the incremental ton for us at this point. We're in North America. It's an import market where we have our assets well placed. And when I say asset, that's the whole base production, logistics, terminals, pipelines, to serve the American or the North American farmer.","So, we want to be active participants in this market and monetize our position here. And then the next step is looking at the export market. As we're adding this new capacity to be a 12 month, 365 day producer of these products, you need to be able to move things out and at times move them out in large quantities.","So that's when we look to the export markets. We are active today in France, in Belgium, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil on UAN. We've opened up Columbia recently. And so when we're focused on products, today, it's predominantly a UAN play. And then, next step, we've had some ammonia exports. We've worked with various people in that market as well as destination consumers, but urea is coming. As we've brought up the new plant and as we move to the spring, we believe that we'll be active more in the world urea market. And so, I think you'll just see our export participation continue to grow and to be an integral part of our business.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","The other thing I'd add to Bert's comment is that, particularly once we're through the OCI transaction and have that trading and distribution business as part of the fold, our desire to export will likely increase. And that's one of the reasons that Bert and his team have been really developing some of these other market opportunities for us, like UAN into Brazil and Argentina, giving us ready demand and outlets for that product as we go through the OCI deal.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Let me ask this then, everyone, of course, is focused on currency implications for price floor risk. But on a different angle, is there any immediate risk you see as a function of China's removal of their crop price support? Does that that put their domestic planting, their nitrogen demand at significant risk or threatening its ability to absorb as much of its own supply?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","So, Matthew, just on the currency devaluation issue. You know that central bank stepped in recently and provided some exchange rate pegging that's actually more favorable than where we thought things were likely going to go. We thought the exchange could close to $7 and it's kind of pegged and the holding steady at $6.51 or $6.50. So, from that perspective, I think there is, at least as we see it today, a little bit less risk on the exchange rate side. But, Bert, why don't you go ahead and handle that?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah, I think when you at what is going on with corn price supports and corn production, you've seen an interesting change over last 10 to 15 years as China has outsourced their soybean production to Brazil, Argentina, the United States and has continued to grow and with that grow their end demand for corn and wheat, and the stockpiles of corn aren't high. That has created some perverse incentives. And so you see sorghum and DDGs and things \u2013 and those substitute products coming in at a greater level into China.","So I think with this release on pricing for corn, you're probably going to see \u2013 you could see maybe a lower level of planting, but, again, it's at a pretty high price today with that subsidy, and \u2013 but they also have a fairly low yield. So, several things are changing in China. The move to acquire Syngenta, which we believe with the seed technology and then germplasm associated with that, and the change possibly to GMO products in China, I think we have an evolving situation, coupled with the change in the economy, this currency devaluation, all of these things together.","I think it's a little early to predict what that result will be to nitrogen, but we see each of these steps as positive opening steps and greater participation in the global market, which sustains the price of corn, soybeans and wheat going forward.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's great. Thanks, gentlemen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Connelly with CLSA. You may begin.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Two easy questions. You mentioned the prospect of a stronger than normal back half of the year. I'm curious if you expect to carry out more inventory from spring, or whether the ramp in new capacity is enough to take care of that?","And then the second question, I'm assuming you're still unhedged on the European business. And I wonder if you could talk about how your hedging strategy is going to evolve as you pick up OCI?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","So, let me, I think, make one clarification and I'll ask Bert to pick up that one. But I think when we're talking about a stronger second half of the fertilizer year, as opposed to a stronger half of \u2013 the second half of the calendar year, because what happened was...","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","... with the low level of application of ammonia in the fall or relatively lighter application, we still see total nitrogen aggregate demand in North America being roughly equivalent to where it was last year. So, corn acres are up a bit. Wheat acres we think are down a bit. Overall kind of the same amount of nitrogen, but with less going down in the fall, that means more has got to go down in the spring in order to get the same kind of yield. So, that's why we're pretty bullish here on the spring application season.","I think everyone says the second half of the year, once you get past July 1, that's a complete reset and you start all over again.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Fair enough.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","I don't know that we're taking a strong position on that one. Relative to Europe, yeah, we are completely unhedged both on the UK production as well as anything on the Continent. And our view historically has been that we hedge in order to take out price volatility typically associated with weather-related events. And recently here as we got into last year, we took some longer positions in North America. Obviously, those positions are upside down. And as we have kind of stepped back and evaluated our thinking on this, I think you'll see us head more towards our traditional approach, which is the hedging is really not try to lock-in any particular cost base over a long period of time, but it's really to take out seasonal volatility and possibly get rid of some basis risk.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. Can you comment on your longer-term expectations regarding the respective cost curves for ammonia and nitrates versus urea due to the regional differences of feedstock costs, FX, et cetera? And then based on this, how do you perceive the average price spread in terms of nutrient tons? Do you believe parities will hold or even potentially expand, specifically in the potential event of further yuan depreciation? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, Chris. Let me start off on kind of the long-term or how we view sort of mid-cycle pricing, which is the way that we kind of evaluate that is based on low cost gas regions bringing on new capacity, new capacity will continue to be added until the next marginal plants only reaches its kind of cost of capital return. And that's the price at which we say is kind of long-term mid-cycle prices.","Even though feedstock costs have declined, as you've said, one of the things that's helpful in that equation is the fact that capital cost continues to increase. And the lowest cost gas region, right now, in terms of added new facilities is North America. And if you look at what the cost to bring new production on in North America, it is very high, as we know all too well.","And the result of that is we have not seen a dramatic shift in our long-term view of where pricing has to be in order to support a healthy marketplace. It's moved a little bit, but not dramatically. And it's really the vast majority of the cost is in the ammonia-making step from a variable cost perspective.","And so we believe that you'll continue to have to have sort of traditional increases in relative values the more upgrade you do because you've got to pay for new capital. Even though there's not very much variable cost there, you have to pay for the new capital to put in each new step in the upgrade process. And the functionality of UAN, as Bert was talking about earlier, is greater than urea or AN, or whatnot.","So each step in the process has to return appropriate capital and also farmer gets more utility out of UAN, so they pay a premium for it. So we don't see that there being a radical change in terms of the underlying margin or pricing structure between products. And in fact, over the long term, we don't see a radical change in terms of where we expect product pricing to trend.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. Specific though, Chris, for the cost curve, we've looked at the urea cost curve, as you know that's the most widely traded globally nitrogen fertilizer there is. When we look at the cost curve and dial ahead 2018, 2019, Chinese anthracite coal production remains the marginal producer. So from a cost curve perspective, although there will be additions in between and subtractions, puts and takes, at the far right hand side of the cost curve remains Chinese producers and at the far left hand side of the cost curve we believe maintains North American production, which is where we sit. So we don't see any major shift in terms of what the actual supply curve looks like going forward.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect, thank you. And just a quick follow-up, now that's been roughly six months since the announcement of the OCI deal, can you just give a little comment on regarding your confidence in the ex tax synergy number across both the U.S. and also European potential? Do you still feel just as comfortable as you did then or have there even been new discoveries for potential opportunities? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, Chris, as we continue to do meetings and integration planning with our OCI counterparts, we continue to find opportunities and other synergies that were not necessarily previously known. I wouldn't say that all of those are in the tax front. In fact, most of them are not, they're mostly on the operational side, but there hasn't been any change in law at this point. And so our confidence level and projections are based on current law.","So that remains as it was and that's why we say from an effective tax rate we're sort of in the low 20%s where we'll settle out we believe.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. You may begin.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So, if I hear Bert correctly, we missed some application in the fall, the winter buying season was pretty slow, and there's a risk of maybe an early spring. In the past that has been a scenario in which the supply chain has gotten pretty stressed. So can you talk if you're doing anything differently from a logistics standpoint this spring compared to the last couple of springs?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Dan. I'll let Bert answer that, but I wouldn't say it's a risk of an early spring. I'd say that's nothing but positive news, if, In fact, we start moving product here earlier than normal. But, Bert, go ahead.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So we look at a number of scenarios, and like any company would be doing scenario planning and looking at our asset capability and meet the customer demand, staying in contact with our customers, what they think they're going to see. And so I do believe you will have a stressed system. That being said, we have set up with our barge service provider ample service and what will be coming out of the plant, mostly Donaldsonville on barge, and utilizing our terminals that are served from the pipeline, as well as by barges, that being ammonia, and we are well positioned for that, and then it's UAN.","And so when you look at probably in our early release on barges for ice lock, getting up into the upper Midwest to our furthest northern most point in Minneapolis, we think we'll be well supplied, well positioned. And as you see the weakening in the oil and the coal markets on rail, we're getting a lot better service from our rail providers. And we have 5,000 to 6,000 railcars in our service, as well as extras if needed. And we're fully utilizing those assets to get product in position.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","The other thing I would add to Bert's comments, Dan, is that, given our broad base of in-market production and all the different major rail lines that we're on, plus all of our storage in different locations, we are sort of really able to deal with supply chain stress and disruptions on any of the rivers or rail systems, I think, better than most people because of the diversity of our asset base and our mix. And so, in a lot of cases, when those discontinuities or stress points happen, it benefits us disproportionately compared to other people. So, we're not afraid of it necessarily. It oftentimes brings some benefit to us.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just quickly on Trinidad gas curtailments have been going on there for several years now. So, is there something that changed your view about the outlook for Trinidad that forced the impairments this quarter? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, I think a couple of things, Dan. As you know, most of the Trinidadian base gas contracts are indexed off of the underlying product. So in our case for our one plant joint venture indexed off of ammonia pricing. Some of them are off of methanol price; some of them are off of ammonia price and so forth.","And so what's happened is as product pricing has come down, that means the gas price into the Point Lisas has stayed has also correspondingly come down. And it means there's less money going to NGC, National Gas Company. It's in the situation where at the price that's currently being paid for the gas that's below what we believe replacement cost of gas in Trinidad is.","And so one of things that is different today than maybe a year or two ago was we believe that curtailments may have been more temporary in the past and that new production was coming online. As we sit here today, gas price doesn't justify the new investment needed to bring on additional production. And at the lower product pricing in the marketplace, you can't make up for the loss production that we're losing. So it's that combination of factors that's really led us to take the impairment.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Wong with RBC. You may begin.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hey, thank you. Good morning. So regarding the share repurchases, I mean, I know they're on hold because of the OCI Transaction, how quickly can you resume repurchases after the transaction is complete? I know there's blackout periods and stuff like that. So if you can just walk us through some of that thinking? And then, what sort of magnitude can we expect for this year?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah. So I would say, Andrew, we are focused right now on getting through close. And as part of that process, of course, we're evaluating and updating our capital position. We believe, as I said earlier, that there's a lot of things that are really wind in our sales. So a combination of the CHS venture commencing and getting that cash in the door, and the benefits that we're going to be receiving as a result of bonus depreciation, means that we've got a lot of liquidity. And given where the share price is trading, of course, we're very anxious to start deploying that. But we need to get through the close first and then we'll make an appropriate announcement. It's going to require authorization by the new Board of Directors of the newly constituted company before we're able to do anything, but I'm as anxious as anyone to get after it as soon as possible.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just switching to something else, the Chinese nitrogen production. I know that there's recently been some reports that they have lower operating rates. Do you have a sense of whether these are more temporary type curtailments or are we talking about more permanent type shutdowns?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","I mean I think our view is, there has been a lot of new capacity coming on in China and the excess overhang is capacity that the world doesn't really need, but these reduction in operating rates tend to be more offset \u2013 permanent offset against some of the new capacity that's come on. We don't think that it makes sense for that \u2013 all of that production to be running where it was. And so, when you see operating rates come back, I think it's not because they're producing \u2013 going to be producing more, it's because some of those plants are going to be permanently shut down and taken kind of off of the capacity curve.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay.

I\u2019m Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications and with me are Steve Wilson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Market Development; and Tony Will, our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its second quarter 2012 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen LP.  On this call we\u2019ll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website.  At the end of the call we\u2019ll host a question and answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the investor relations section of our website at www.cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.  All statements in the release and on this call other than those relating to historical information or current conditions are considered forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control and which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements.","These risks and uncertainties include those spelled out in the Safe Harbor Statement included in yesterday\u2019s new release and the Slides accompanying this call.  Consider all forward-looking statements in light of those and other risks and uncertainties and do now place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.","Now, let me introduce Steve Wilson, our Chairman and CEO.","Stephen R. Wilson ","Yesterday afternoon CF Industries reported earnings of $606 million and diluted earnings per share of $9.31, both records for any quarter in the company\u2019s history.  We also generated over $1 billion of EBITDA during the quarter.  These results attest to the earnings power of CF Industries, the execution of our business plans, and very favorable market conditions.","With the early start to the planting season, strong corn demand, and attractive farm level economics, over 96 million acres of corn were planted, a post WWII record.  The high corn acreage along with ideal spring weather conditions created strong nitrogen demand that continued through the planting season.  As a result, for the first six months of the year, we sold a record volume of nitrogen products driven by ammonia and urea.","During this time period we sold nearly 75,000 tons more ammonia than last year and about 120,000 tons more urea.  The increase in urea sales was possible due to our flexible configuration that allowed us to cut back UAN production in order to maximize higher margin urea.  Market demand in the second quarter was strong for all nitrogen products although we sold less nitrogen in the second quarter 2012 than in 2011.  This was primarily due to demand that was pulled forward to the first quarter.","The strong demand and movement through distributors and retailers during the quarter resulted in exceptionally low North American nitrogen inventories at June 30th.  Using our own inventories as proxies for those across North America, we believe that producer inventories of nitrogen products were at or near historical lows.","Throughout this period of high demand our team worked diligently to meet our customers\u2019 nutrient needs.  This is evidenced by the record 95,000 tons of ammonia that we shipped through our Velva North Dakota terminal in April and May.  To put this movement in context, we have only 30,000 tons of storage at Velva which means we turned the inventory in that location three times during those two months.  Our employees demonstrated terrific execution which allowed us to capture incremental sales and margin during a peak period.","The application season demand was evident in the prices we realized during the quarter.  Urea prices increased 34% compared to a year ago driven by strong demand and tight North American inventory.  Ammonia prices increased 7% due to high demand for direct application.  UAN prices were essentially unchanged from the second quarter 2011 but were up sequentially as customers came into the market after delaying purchases earlier in the year.","It was not until the application season came to an end that urea and UAN prices began their normal declines from seasonal highs.  However, ammonia prices remained high at the end of the quarter due to ongoing demand for direct application of the phosphate production, tight worldwide supply, and low inventories throughout the distribution channel.  During the quarter we continued to benefit from low cost natural gas as increased gas production kept prices in check even with the demand created by hot weather and the associated increase in electricity consumption.","In our phosphate segment, export sales were up 21% as international markets continued to provide us with the best margin opportunities.  Additionally, during the quarter we started manufacturing sulfur enhanced MAP, or MAPS which was moved into inventory in preparation for sales in future periods.","During the quarter CF Industries generated exceptional earnings and operating cash flow.  We utilized some of that cash to complete the remaining $500 million of our share repurchase program at an average price of $163.89 per share.  Under the full $1.5 billion repurchase program we bought back a total of 9.6 million shares at an average price of $156.80.  We are pleased to have completed the program and I will have additional comments on our capital allocation plans after Dennis provides more financial highlights from the quarter and first half.","Dennis P. Kelleher ","During the second quarter of 2012 the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $606 million or $9.31 per diluted share.  This compares to $487 million or $6.75 per diluted share in the second quarter 2011.  Our second quarter 2012 earnings included a non-cash mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives of approximately $78 million and $15 million of amortization of capitalized financing fees related to the termination of our prior credit facility.  The net impact of these two items was an increase of $0.60 in after tax earnings per diluted share.","Our nitrogen business performed exceptionally well during the second quarter. We delivered 3.5 million tons of nitrogen products and achieved a gross margin of 66% which you can see on Slide Six.  The increase in segment gross margin reflects released natural gas cost of $3.13 per mmbtu during the second quarter of 2012 as compared to $4.32 a year ago.  It also reflects a non-cash mark-to-market gain of $78 million on natural gas derivatives contracts in the second quarter 2012 as compared to a loss of $14 million in the prior year period.  At the end of the quarter we had hedged positions for approximately 60% of our expected natural gas purchases for the remainder of 2012.","During the second quarter of 2012 we sold 793,000 tons of ammonia at an average released price of $635 per ton.  Ammonia volume for the second quarter of 2012 was 19% lower than a year ago primarily due to the early start of the application season in 2012 that pulled ammonia demand into the first quarter of the year.  Our average released sales price for ammonia was 7% higher in the second quarter of last year due to tight industry wide inventory and strong demand.","Second quarter sales of granular urea decreased by 5% year-over-year to 694,000 tons.  Our volume decreased due to lower sales into the northern tier of the US and lower inventory available for sale at the beginning of the quarter due to the strong sales volume in the first quarter of 2012.  Our average realized price of $522 per ton was 34% higher than in the second quarter of 2011 due to tight North American product inventories and robust demand through the application season.","During the second quarter of 2012 we sold nearly 1.63 million tons of UAN compared to approximately 1.65 million tons in the second quarter 2011.  Average UAN price realizations were $324 per ton essentially unchanged from the second quarter 2011.  As shown on Slide Seven, our phosphate segment achieved total revenues during the quarter of $232 million down about 22% from the second quarter 2011.  Total sales volume was 493,000 tons, 8% lower than in the second quarter 2011.","Exports increased from 45% of our phosphate sales volume in the second quarter 2011 to 59% this year because of stronger buying interest and more attractive net prices outside North America.  Average phosphate price realizations during the second quarter were about 15% lower than 2011 due to muted global demand and the segment generated 22% gross margin down from the 29% gross margin reported a year ago due to lower average selling prices.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $446 million in the second quarter 2012, an increase of $195 million from 2011 primarily due to higher net earnings and lower accounts receivables.  These quarterly results contributed to a record setting first half for CF Industries.  For the six months ended June 30, 2012 the company set records across a number of financial metrics including revenues, EBITDA, earnings, and earnings per share.","Total first half revenues were a record $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the prior year.  First half volume was a record 7.7 million tons compared to 7.6 million tons the prior year period.  Total EBITDA for the six month period increased 19% to $1.8 billion while total gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 54% from 47% driven by both higher selling prices and lower natural gas costs.","These items contributed to a 27% increase in net earnings to common stockholders to a record $975 million and a long with share repurchase activity increased earnings per diluted share by 39% to $14.81 per share.  The repurchase program lowered our weighted average diluted share count in the second quarter by 1.3 million shares which had the impact of increasing our earnings per share by $0.19.  Total repurchases made under the program approved in August 2011 reduced weighted average diluted shares for the six months ended June 30, 2012 by 7.2 million shares which increased our year-to-date earnings per diluted share by $1.46.","Finally, I want to highlight the recent move by Standard & Poors to upgrade our credit ratings to investment grade.  This is the latest recognition by the rating agencies of the strength of our business model and our successful track record in executing our business plans and maintaining an investment grade credit rating profile.","Now, let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson ","Long term trends and population growth, higher protein diets, and the use of crops for renewable fuels continue to drive demand for plant nutrients.  [Inaudible] global grain and oil seed supplies have driven crop prices higher and created the incentives for farmers to plant a large crop again next year.  Natural gas prices are in a favorable range for us and have contributed to a strong earnings profile for the company.","What was great weather for spring planting and fertilizer applications turned into very difficult growing conditions in many areas.  The dry and hot weather has reduced expectations for yields, harvested acres, and therefore crop production.  This naturally should lead to very low [stock-to-use] ratios for crops, corn being the most significant.  We currently estimate US corn yields will be approximately 135 bushels per acre which would be the lowest yield since 2002 and that number could go even lower.","Given their poor condition, crops in many fields will be abandoned and harvested corn acres will likely be two to four million acres lower than the latest USDA forecast.  This significant decline in corn production will be partially offset by reduced demand due to high corn prices but still could result in a [stock-to-use] ratio of just 5.5% for the 2012 to 2013 marketing year which would be the second lowest level in 40 years.","Reduced corn supply is creating a need and high corn prices are creating the incentive for farmers to plant an estimated 96 million acres of corn again in 2013.  This expected large planted crop supports our expectation for significant demand for nitrogen, a nutrient that must be applied every year.  We are aware that good fall application conditions require additional moisture and of course we don\u2019t know whether sufficient rain will arrive.  However, regardless of fall conditions, high grain prices and expected spring planting should result in strong nutrient demand.","We expect phosphate demand to be strong for the rest of the year.  Increased demand in Latin America is expected to develop as tight worldwide course grain stocks and associated high grain prices motivate farmers to plant significant acres of all crops, especially soybeans.  India still needs to purchase additional phosphates which would also provide support to the market through the balance of the year.","These near term dynamics are representative of the long term fundamentals that support our beliefs in the value of CF Industries and the cash generation capabilities of our business given us confidence that we can both invest for earnings growth and return cash to shareholders.  Our recent announced agreement to purchase Viterra\u2019s interest in CFL, our jointly owned nitrogen production facility in Medicine Hat, Alberta is a key example of our strategy to invest in projects that have attractive risk adjusted returns.","We have operated the Medicine Hat complex for 35 years and know the asset inside and out.  The facility is located in one of the lowest natural gas cost regions in North America and serves a key agricultural area.  We look forward to having access to all of Medicine Hat\u2019s production and to being able to make investment decisions at our sole discretion.","As noted in our earnings release, we recently reviewed and updated our potential North American nitrogen investment opportunities.  We now anticipate spending approximately $2 billion between 2013 and 2016 on capacity expansion and product upgrade projects.  These projects, if all are approved and executed, could provide us with approximately 1 million additional gross tons of ammonia and 3.5 million tons of combined UAN and urea capacity.","We expect that the bulk of these investments will be made from 2014 through 2016 and that meaningful amounts of additional ammonia capacity could come on stream beginning in 2015.  The nature of these brown field investments should enable us to bring additional product to market well before a Greenfield complex could be permitted and constructed.  We expect to announce some specifics of this program before year end.","While we\u2019re making these investments to enhancing earning capacity of our business, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders.  As part of our plans to do so, we have approved a new program to repurchase up to $3 billion worth of our common shares through December 31, 2016.  We believe that a judiciously executed share repurchase program is the most appropriate means by which we can return excess cash to shareholders yet retain the flexibility to invest in value enhancing growth opportunities such as the acquisition of the interest in CFL and our capacity expansion projects.","We completed the prior repurchase program within 10 months, a full 19 months before its expiration and we executed the program in a measured and disciplined fashion.  Given the size and duration of the new share repurchase initiative we believe it should be viewed as a long term program rather than as a single event.  We will continue to carefully weigh our options and invest cash when and where we feel it will provide the best returns.","Before taking your questions I\u2019d like to reflect on our strategic positioning.  Our company has developed and successfully executed a sharply focused strategy based on our operating strengths and our commitment to shareholder value.  The Terra acquisition in 2010 more than doubled our capacity in the North American nitrogen industry creating the largest presence in arguably the best market in the world and with the best cost profile from which to serve that market.","Both our upcoming Medicine Hat acquisition and our brown field investment program are completely aligned with that strategy.  This focused growth strategy has been complimented by returning to shareholders capital that is not needed to execute our investment program.  The new $3 billion share purchase program is an extension of that commitment to our shareholders.  It is my hope and our teams shared objective that our shareholders recognize the operating, investment, and financial discipline that has led to these decisions and the resulting actions and performance.  This focus and discipline will continue to characterize all of our activities.","With that we\u2019ll now open the line to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","A quick question on your nitrogen capital projects in North America.  You\u2019ve raised that number to 2 billion from one to 1.5 previously, I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on whether or not the cost per unit of capacity is rising or whether it\u2019s the case that you\u2019re simply looking at more incremental capacity now than you might have been in the past or perhaps some combination of those two?","Stephen R. Wilson ","Essentially what we found is more opportunity than we thought we had when we last talked about this.  In other words, more capacity and upgrading capability that we originally thought.","Kevin McCarthy \u2013 Bank of America","Just maybe a broad question Steve with regard to the way this crop is shaping up and the epic drought everyone is experiencing.  You threw out some numbers on yield and a forecast that the harvested acres would decline as well.  If we have a more extreme scenario where production comes in say less than 11 million bushels, as an example, can you speak to how you think corn demand will be backed out in terms of animal feed, exports, and whether or not you think the ethanol mandate will be addressed as some point in terms of a waiver?","Stephen R. Wilson ","We think in general the market will take care of rationing itself.  Everyone knows that livestock herds are being thinned as we speak.  That\u2019s the first piece of demand to go away.  Certainly it\u2019s possible that export volume could go down and we\u2019ve seen some economics at work in the ethanol market, capacity being throttled back and then coming back in and so forth so I\u2019d expect to see that continue.  Whether the ethanol mandate might be suspended or waive is obviously a political decision.  The political winds go in various directions during an election year so it\u2019s hard to predict whether that might happen but it\u2019s certainly a potential tool to ratio corn demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna International Group.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","A question on your nitrogen capital plans, first on Greenfield, I know you\u2019ve been a little more cautious on the ability to get permits for Greenfield nitrogen.   Some of your competitors don\u2019t seem to think it\u2019s an issue so maybe you could just update us on permitting status for a new plant and why you\u2019re still not considering a Greenfield plant?  Then on your increase in capacity, is that partly due to Medicine Hat that now you\u2019ve got more flexibility once you own 100% that you can put more capacity north of the border which I guess is a somewhat friendlier permitting environment?","Stephen R. Wilson ","With respect to your second question, I don\u2019t think acquiring the Medicine Hat interest impacts our general look at this portfolio of opportunities.  Medicine Hat was in the mix of sites being considered all along and continues to be certainly on the table for us.  With respect to Greenfield versus brown field and related permitting issues, I mean permitting is a challenge in industrial businesses in America broadly.  Fortunately for us, we operate at seven sites in North America, we have brown field opportunities in many of those locations and so we\u2019re really not faced with the challenge of Greenfield citing.","The brown field opportunities are much more economic.  We believe they can be permitted, designed, and built much faster than a Greenfield opportunity so we\u2019re very pleased with the position that we\u2019re in.  But, permitting is a challenge and I certainly would caution anybody who is thinking about building capacity in the US who doesn\u2019t have experience here.  It\u2019s a hell of a challenge to get a complex permitted.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna International Group","Just a follow up on that Greenfield permitting, does that mean you have no plans at this time for a Greenfield plant or are you just waiting for November 7th to see if there is a friendlier regulatory environment in the US?","Stephen R. Wilson ","The menu of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at under the $2 billion we\u2019ve talked about are all brown field opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I just wanted to follow up on your last comments regarding the share repurchase and I think I heard something so I just want to clarify it.  You seemed to indicate that this repurchase would be, I think you said something more long term in nature and less a function of singular events.  I just wanted to maybe try and understand how you\u2019re going to allocate all this capital under the scope of the idea that obviously you want to remain investment grade so were you trying to say we should look to or we should model share repurchases happening ratably a quarter or do you think it would still be more opportunistic relative to where the equity value trades?","Stephen R. Wilson ","What I was hoping to do was sort of broaden the look at this activity that investors and analysts give it.  We\u2019ve done two repurchase programs since we\u2019ve been public.  They were understandably the focus of attention by investors and I believe they were viewed as events.  Given now we\u2019ve put in place a $3 billion repurchase program with a window that is a multiyear window we would hope to reduce the focus on the frequency and magnitude of share repurchases as being a quarterly event and hope you and others would view what we\u2019ve done in the past as an indication that we are very prudent deployers of capital, that we make good decisions whether they are investments in capital expenditures or investments in our own shares, and that we have a good track record of doing that and intend to continue.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just as a follow up, could you just discuss a little bit anything you\u2019re hearing from customers on cash flow issues or maybe also what\u2019s happening with the river system given the low levels of water and if that poses or means anything in terms of the second half.","Stephen R. Wilson ","I\u2019ll talk briefly about the river system and then I\u2019ll ask Bert Frost to comment on the customer side.  We do have low river levels, it\u2019s created some challenges.  The challenge for us in the fertilizer business is not quite as great as it might be for example for people moving grain because the number of barges in a tow of fertilizer is much smaller than the number of barges in a tow of grain.","But it is slowing us down and it has a little bit of cost in the process. We believe we\u2019re in a good position to meet all of our customer needs.  That\u2019s assuming that for example, customer docks are accessible and things like that and those can be issues in individual locations.  But I would say so far we\u2019re coping reasonably well and we have a very skilled supply chain group.  This is what they do for a living and they\u2019ve got their thumb on the pulse of all of this and are working hard to make this a non-event.","Bert A. Frost ","Regarding customer, I think cash flows, you have to remember our customer base is broad.  We\u2019re exporting products through our key trade arm, we\u2019re working with wholesalers, retailers, and traders in the United States.  So if you\u2019re narrowly looking at a cash flow issue you\u2019d probably go down to the retailer.  We\u2019ve had several really good years in the United States with fertilizer, input, and feed movement and so I think today everyone in the value chain is doing well.  What you will probably see as we go through the drought and the harvest and ramifications of that you will see the revenue guarantee programs of crop insurance kicking in so there will be an average of the harvest month and then the farmers will then be getting that cash and that\u2019s where I think it begins, at that level of cash flow.","Then that will work its way back up the value chain and those farmers will then start purchasing their crop inputs and we will see a more normal probably movement of purchasing and movement to the field in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to circle back and talk a little bit more about some of the international events happening.  One, I was wondering what your expectations are for Chinese urea and phosphate exports in the second half of the year and then secondarily when you think some of this new capacity in the Middle East is now going to come online?","Stephen R. Wilson ","Our view on urea exports out of China for this year is down from last year something in the range of 2.8 million tons or thereabouts.  Last year I think it was about 3.5 so that\u2019s a significant drop.  Of course, we don\u2019t have any direct insight into how they manage this specifically we just watch the flows like everyone else.","With respect to capacity expansions, every year we go through a cycle of looking at all of the new capacity that is looming on the horizon and then we watch as the year unfolds and invariably a number of projects are delayed and that has been the case again, this year there have been delays on projects either in the construction or the ramping up for example, [COPCO 6s] is up but it\u2019s not running at capacity.  We have projects in Egypt that are delayed, and so forth.","I think by in large what has happened again this year is we roughly have capacity coming on roughly in line with the growth in demand and we\u2019re certainly comfortable with our global situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup.","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","You mentioned 96 million acres of corn again in 2013.  Do you have an estimate for soybeans?  Then secondly, just on this acreage issue, Latin American acres are likely to go up but do you have anything on what you\u2019re thinking how much it would go up?","Stephen R. Wilson ","Our number for soybeans for next year is about 77 million acres.  I\u2019m sorry, what was your second question?","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","How much could Latin American acres go up next year to compensate for the loss production in the US?","Bert A. Frost ","I think you\u2019re going to see \u2013 well, they\u2019re coming out of a difficult period where they harvested where you saw the loss in production in Argentina.  What you\u2019re going to see is they roll into their planting season in October, and Brazil specifically is a heavy influence on soybean, probably at the detriment to first crop corn but I think you\u2019ll see a rolling off of cotton which is planted in November, a decrease in that acreage and that rolling into second crop corn.  So we\u2019re anticipating an increase in fertilizer, both nitrogen and phosphate in South America to one, achieve higher yields and two, due to higher acres planted.","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Secondly, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about drought and the dry soil and how it relates to nitrogen application.  Can you differentiate between sort of ammonia that is applied in the fall versus urea that could be applied in the spring and how does that shift occur between fall and spring?","Stephen R. Wilson ","The basics here, should we get no rain or insufficient rain between now and the harvest, we would have very challenging field conditions for ammonia in the affected regions and it manifests itself in two ways by an inability to get the tools into the soil breaking tools, etc., breaking the knives, and secondly, if there\u2019s lack of moisture inability to effectively seal the gaseous product into the soil.  If that were to happen or in areas where that happens that will simply change the timing of the nitrogen application and perhaps the form of nitrogen application.  It still would take a lot of nitrogen to support 96 million acres of corn and it will eventually get applied.","P. J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup","Just lastly, you mentioned a Chinese urea export number, do you have a similar phosphate export number for China?","Stephen R. Wilson ","Our estimate is about 3.5 million tons of that down from around four million last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities","When you think about your fertilizer production capability in 2013 versus 2012 excluding the enhanced ownership interest in Medicine Hat, is it very much different than your capacity in 2012?  That is does it grow and if it grows where does it grow?","Stephen R. Wilson ","I think it\u2019s moving up a little bit.  I\u2019ll ask Tony Will to comment on that.","W. Anthony Will ","I think the biggest source of increase for us \u201913 over \u201912 is that as we mentioned early in the year 2012 had an abnormally high amount of turnaround activity.  2011 was very light, 2012 was high and 2013 will return to a more sort of moderate or normal year.  So that would account for a couple of percentage point increase in terms of total production for \u201913 over \u201912.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Securities","Just in terms of your capital expenditures in the second quarter versus the first, you spent about $30 million more, what did you spend it on?  What was the nature of the step up?","Dennis P. Kelleher ","We have a variety of projects in flight and a lot of that is just the timing of the cash flows and when the bills come in to be paid.  As we\u2019ve kind of provided some guidance, we\u2019re still looking at somewhere circa $400 million for the year.  I think the run rate is a bit below that currently but again, that\u2019s more of a timing issue than whether we will get the projects done.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edlain Rodriquez \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets.","Edlain Rodriquez \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Just a quick question on your financial strategy, now that you\u2019ve put to rest the share buyback issues have you ever thought of ways to make the dividend yield more attractive such as establishing a base dividend and then kind of letting it fluctuate up and down by linking it to earnings growth also?","Stephen R. Wilson ","Well, we consider and debate a lot of things and that\u2019s an interesting idea.  As I commented on in my prepared remarks, we have come to the conclusion that for a company like us the best way for us to return capital to shareholders in significant amount is through a share repurchase program.  It is a lot more flexible, it allows us to manage the outflow to shareholders along with other outflows, notably investments either inside the fence or M&A activity.  We will continue to look at all these things as time marches on but we\u2019re pretty comfortable with where we landed on this matrix of opportunity.","Edlain Rodriquez \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Now that your debt ratings have improved, how are you going to pay for the $950 million?  Is it going to be all cash or is it going to be some debt related to that?  Also, just in terms of the tax rate we should be looking for going forward, should it be that 32% you had in the first quarter or should it be the 36% we\u2019ve had previously?","Stephen R. Wilson ","It is our intention to pay for Medicine Hat out of available cash.  Obviously, there will be a number of months between now and closing and we\u2019ll be generating even more cash than our current position.","Dennis P. Kelleher ","With respect to tax rate, you saw the tax rate whether you look at non-controlling interest or not around 35% or 32% if you include the non-controlling interest.  We don\u2019t expect that to change materially going forward it\u2019s about where we expect to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from Analyst for Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA.","Analyst for Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","I was hoping that you could provide some thoughts on extending overseas as a means of possible diversification?","Stephen R. Wilson ","We have considered overseas nitrogen investment on occasion.  There was a time and it wasn\u2019t too long ago when we felt we had a desperate need to diversify away from North American natural gas risk and I guess the judicious way in which we approached it played to our advantage because we didn\u2019t make any decisions to go forward in that regard.  We don\u2019t have blinders on though, people bring ideas to us on a sporadic basis.  We always look at those ideas and should we find one that meets our criteria we would be certainly interested in pursuing it.","Those criteria are being close to a reliable and low cost source of raw materials, having a stable political and economic environment, having access to deep water because of the need to trade products globally, and being in reasonable proximity to attractive markets.  But from where we are today the natural gas fundamentals both in North America and around the world suggest that our North American strategy is the appropriate one.  On a risk adjusted basis it\u2019s hard for any offshore opportunity to come even close to the kind of brown field opportunities that we have in front of us today.","Analyst for Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Can you give an update on your nat gas hedging strategy with gas moving up lately?","Dennis P. Kelleher ","Like we mentioned in the text of our prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got 60% of the gas we\u2019ll need to consume in the remainder of the year has been hedged in the sense that we\u2019ve got spots covering it and 40% is uncovered.  Going into 2013 I don\u2019t think we have very much hedged out into 2013.  That\u2019s kind of where we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.","My question is around export phosphate prices.  Based on your commentary on Latin American phosphate demand is it fair to say you see upward risk in phosphate export prices compared to the second quarter in the second half?","Stephen R. Wilson ","What do you mean by upward risk?","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.","The potential for further price increases in the export markets.","Stephen R. Wilson ","That\u2019s risk we would welcome.","Dennis P. Kelleher ","We see positive markets going forward.  You still have significant India demand to be fulfilled and less Chinese product available as well as a narrow window to export that product on top of what you mentioned, the Latin America demand that would be Brazil, Argentina, as well as Chile and some of the other countries, Central America and Peru that we\u2019re participating in.  So you have that combined with low inventories around the world Europe as well as North America, so we see a positive operating environment and price environment going forward.","Tim Tiberio \u2013 Miller Tabak & Co., LLC.","Just one last question as far as the potential impact from the timing of insurance payments this year, do you think that will have a material impact on the demand linearity compared to 2011 or do you think most of the farmers should be able to get their insurance repayments before the start of the fall ammonia application season?","Dennis P. Kelleher ","I wouldn\u2019t be that narrow in your view.  Yes, there is the issue of crop insurance and when those payments will be made, but you have to remember we\u2019ve had several very positive years in the agricultural segment especially in the United States where farmers are probably doing very well on a cash flow basis and then there are other revenue opportunities or loans that are available that can be based off the crop insurance money coming in.","So a farmer is not going to miss his application of crop nutrient or applications whether that be [N, P, or K] just because of his insurance payment coming in a little late.  With the weather is cooperative, and his field is ready, and his crops have come off, he will apply his crop nutrients to prepare himself to plant in the spring.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson \u2013 Scotia Capital.","Ben Isaacson \u2013 Scotia Capital","Just two quick questions, first can you talk a little bit about where the products will get placed that you\u2019ve purchased from CFL?  Will that go to the new owners of the Viterra retail assets or will that go into your kind of larger distribution network?","Stephen R. Wilson ","We\u2019re pleased to be able to acquire that interest and have that product to sell.  All that product is going someplace today, we\u2019re going to be setting up a sales operation in that region and we look forward to developing relationships with customers who are interested in taking the product.  We\u2019ll be open for business and have the order book in hand.","Ben Isaacson \u2013 Scotia Capital","Then just a second question maybe for Bert.  You talk about lower granular urea sales into the northern tier of the US.  Was that a strategic decision you made on a one off basis and if so why?  Or, was that due to poor demand?  Can you give just a little bit of color there?","Bert A. Frost ","As we look at our mix and where we move our products, we tend to move some of that Medicine Hat product into the northern tier where you had a lot of corn acreage this year which for that reason we Velva and our high ammonia pull through that terminal during April and May but then that market also uses urea as well as Montana and Idaho.  So we had a little bit of a decrease in that northern tier but also we had a little less of production so that got factored into the mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ian Horowitz \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets.","Ian Horowitz \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Just a quick question around the moisture necessary, can you just give us a little bit more color? I mean I understand with some rain the fall application season can go as scheduled but what exactly does that mean?  We\u2019re seeing drought conditions throughout the US at significantly high levels, how much rain is necessary to keep everything on track?","Bert A. Frost ","You have to remember when we talk about the drought it\u2019s not throughout the United States.  There are some areas that are having fairly good yields, that would be the southern tier like Mississippi, Louisiana as well as the northern tier Minnesota and North Dakota.  However, there are areas that are experiencing a lack of rain as we know and that could be spotty we\u2019re not climatologists, we\u2019re not weather people.  You read some of these reports also and current expectations, if you look at the trends for example in Boone County Iowa, the average rain fall is eight inches during the period of September through November and we expect that if they were to receive five inches, during that period, that would be significant enough to allow not only application but sealing of the ammonia.","Ian Horowitz \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","So something along that kind of ratio would be necessary to be able to do a traditional application?","Bert A. Frost ","I gave you a snapshot of one county in Iowa just to give you an indication.  We do need rain.  It will come in some form or fashion and if there\u2019s not sufficient rain available then UAN becomes a great product and we happen to be a great producer of that product.","Ian Horowitz \u2013 Topeka Capital Markets","Is there a temperature issue that we should be concerned about as well for fall?","Bert A. Frost ","No, our customers the retailer, wholesalers and traders that sell our products to the farmer, the farmer is well aware of what he needs to do ergonomically to be successful and that\u2019s following the four R application and there\u2019s a specific temperature of around 50 degrees that they target.  So it\u2019s not necessarily an ambient temperature but a soil temperature that they target and then obviously, like I said earlier, the ability to seal.","Operator","Your next question comes from [Mark Gooley \u2013 Gooley & Associates].","[Mark Gooley \u2013 Gooley & Associates]","I have two questions, I\u2019m going to ask you to put on your crop economist hat for a second.  If you go back and look at what demand forecasts were for corn way back in let\u2019s say February we were talking about 13 million bushels, do you have a view right now how much at least semi permanent demand destruction there\u2019s been because of these high prices, demand that won\u2019t come back for a bit on a go forward basis as we look into demand for next year?","Stephen R. Wilson ","I don\u2019t think I have such a number.  I wouldn\u2019t suggest that there\u2019s any permanent demand destruction.  The market will correct itself.  When we get off $8 corn we\u2019ll have some demand come back.  When it gets down to $6 we\u2019ll have more come back.  It\u2019s a pretty elastic market.","[Mark Gooley \u2013 Gooley & Associates]","Secondly, with respect to your purchase of the Medicine Hat minority interest, I guess the good news is that you got that at a very attractive EBITDA multiple.  But I guess the flip side of that coin is a little bit to the extent that the seller is willing to part with that asset at such a low multiple, what does that say about the profitability prospects for ammonia going forward?  It would suggest that perhaps these peak levels are peak levels and that the real multiple on a go forward basis is somewhat higher than the one you might calculate.","Stephen R. Wilson ","I have two comments on it.  First of all, the seller is not in the fertilizer manufacturing and distribution business.  The seller is after other assets out of Viterra, the grain assets in particular so this is an asset that they weren\u2019t interested in maintaining.  Secondly, this is quite an attractive area.  It\u2019s gas cost advantaged and I think likely to continue to be so and I\u2019d suggest that anyone who cares to look at this more closely can simply take the additional volumes we are acquiring, apply an [inaudible] of gas cost and market prices that are available in that region which are readily available in public sources and I think you\u2019ll find that the EBITDA potential there is quite attractive and we\u2019re very excited to be acquiring this asset at this price.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen I will now turn the call over to Dan Swenson.","Dan Swenson","We\u2019d like to thank everyone who participated on the call today.

And with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development; and Chris Bohn, our Senior Vice President of Supply Chain.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its first quarter 2015 results yesterday afternoon, as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website.

These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we posted our financial results for the first quarter, in which we generated $486 million of EBITDA and $4.79 in earnings per diluted share. Our first quarter was about three things: great operations, a strong order book and cash deployment.","This enabled us to deliver roughly $500 million in EBITDA, even in a quarter characterized by cold wet weather, which delayed applications; and abundant nitrogen imports, which put pressure on prices. The global cost curve continues to demonstrate its reliability, and CF Industries continues to deliver significant cash flows.","Now let me provide a little more color on our execution this quarter. We had a really strong operating quarter, with our ammonia plants running at a system-wide capacity utilization rate of 99%, even with a major turnaround at our Verdigris, Oklahoma facility.","While delivering strong production numbers, importantly, we ran our business safely, achieving an all-time record safety performance with our 12-month reportable incident rate falling to 1.1, its lowest level ever and well below the industry average of 2.8.","We had a strong order book coming in to 2015, which enable us to realize attractive average prices for our products relative to market conditions. Our average ammonia price was 15% higher than last year, due to a tighter market in our decision to forego some less-attractive sales in the middle of winter in order to have the inventory available for spot sales in spring.","Our UAN prices were relatively unchanged as, again, we held back from less-attractive winter and early spring sales, choosing instead to wait for the application season demand to emerge. And while our urea prices were lower on a year-over-year basis, we were pleased with the decision we made in the fourth quarter to lock in forward sales at prices that were very favorable compared to how the market developed in the first quarter.","We continue to have a cost advantage from low prices of North American natural gas. Although the weather was nearly as cold as last year's record-setting winner, natural gas prices have continued a downward trend. With production growth and an abundant level of gas reserves, both spot prices in the NYMEX forward strip are well below where they were this time last year.","Accordingly, we have decided to lock in 50% of our total gas needs at these low prices through the end of the year and have hedges in place for roughly 15% of our gas requirements for the period January to October of 2016. Dennis will provide additional color on our gas hedging in a moment.","Work is progressing well on our expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. Our urea plant at Donaldsonville is expected to begin production during the third quarter of this year. The structural steel and vessel installations are essentially complete, along with over 70% of the piping. The vast majority of steel for the UAN plant has been erected and the piping is well underway. And we are confident of a fourth quarter start-up target for that plant. Work on the projects continues to be in line with our last cost projection of $4.2 billion, plus or minus a few percentage points.","Additionally, we invested in share repurchases during the quarter. We became more comfortable with the projected timing and levels of our cash outflows for the balance of the year on the expansion projects. This allowed us to comfortably restart our share repurchases, which was timely, given that our share price had dropped below $300, even further below our view of intrinsic value. We repurchased 812,000 shares during the quarter and an additional 493,000 subsequent to the end of the quarter. Additionally, we increased our revolving credit facility from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, providing us further liquidity.","As indicated on slide 12 of the deck, these repurchases have contributed to an increase in our nitrogen capacity per 1,000 shares, which was about 53 tons prior to the Terra acquisition and stands at 143 tons today. By the middle of 2016, including the production from the expansion projects, this will increase to 180 tons, with additional upside from potential future share repurchases.","Now let me hand the call over to Bert to walk through our sales results for the quarter. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Thanks, Tony. We are pleased with our sales results for the first quarter of 2015, as it showed the benefit of how we manage our business depending on varying market conditions. Our ammonia segment had lower sales volume when compared to the first quarter in 2014.","Since we had lower inventory available coming into the quarter, we decided to maintain some of it across the seasonally weak months of January and February. That decision benefited us in April, as we saw strong demand emerge. And we were actively shipping ammonia to customers during that time period.","Although our sales volumes decreased, we had much stronger average sales prices this year, due to the industry having a tighter North American inventory balance than in the first quarter of 2014. We sold a significant amount of ammonia into this market and as a result, we're able to realize an average price of $542 per short ton this year compared to $472 last year.","Our urea volume increased in 2015 compared to 2014. We believed prices were attractive early in the quarter, so we took advantage of available inventory and sold it during a time of favorable pricing conditions. Throughout the quarter, urea prices declined at the U.S. Gulf in association with high global supply and a notable increase in Chinese exports. In response, we used our logistical assets to move products to regions we felt offered the most attractive pricing opportunities. The strong order book we had coming into the quarter and the decisions we made about when and where to sell our products allowed us to realize an average urea price of $344 per short ton.","Our UAN segment had sales volume that was slightly lower than the prior-year period, as we had fewer attractive sales opportunities where product was readily available. Our average realized price was in line with last year, as the UAN market was relatively stable and traded at strong unit level premiums to urea.","As we look to the second quarter, we are enthused about our prospects. Shipments have been brisk during the past several weeks, as farmers progressed with field work. Ammonia demand has been strong, as farmers seek to make up for a shortfall in fall 2014 ammonia application. Pricing conditions have been attractive in association with this strong demand.","The urea markets saw a reduction in global prices from January through April, due to continued high production and exports from China. With U.S. Gulf prices trading down to an average of $280 per ton at the end of March, we believe a significant number of marginal producers, especially in China, are not able to cover their cash costs.","This view held true, as show in the April Indian urea tender, where Chinese producers did not offer supply at prices they deemed too low. Urea pricing recovered somewhat after the tender, moving up to $300 \u2013 maybe even to $325 per short ton in NOLA by early May. We believe that the cost curve continues to hold and observe that occasionally, prices will dip below the theoretical floor, similar to what we saw in October of 2013. And then, when those marginal producers slow down shipments, it creates the condition for a price recovery.","UAN shipments should be robust this spring, due to good overall nitrogen demand. With deferred fall ammonia applications and the relatively tight ammonia market, we expect that UAN will be the product of choice for farmers' nitrogen needs.","However, the decline in prices in the urea market is expected to weigh on UAN prices as well. We entered the second quarter with a favorable order book, and we'll continue to take new orders as we progress through the quarter and into the fill season.","We normally don't speak to the second half of the year on our first quarter call, but I will make the observation that with the start-up of our new urea and UAN plants in Donaldsonville, we will have less net ammonia available for sale in Q3 and Q4.","This will allow us to make decisions with our customer and sales mix to make sure we are realizing the highest value available for our ammonia inventory. As always, we will balance our production mix based on product prices in order to maximize our earnings.","Now let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bert. We had a good operating quarter, as evidenced by our 43.6% nitrogen product segment combined gross margin, $486 million of EBITDA and $4.79 of diluted earnings per share. A few discrete items impacted the year-over-year comparability of our EBITDA. These include the losses we had on foreign currency derivatives this year compared to the gains we had on those items last year. Largely offsetting these was the swing from a mark-to-market unrealized loss on gas derivatives last year to an unrealized gain this year.","Our ammonia segment cost of sales is reflective of the price of natural gas that we purchased and used in the fourth quarter to produce ammonia inventory that was sold in the first quarter, as represented on slide six. Our reported ammonia segment gross margin percentage was also negatively affected by ammonia that we purchased at market prices from our Trinidad joint venture, and then resold to Mosaic at similar market-based prices.","We had a full quarter of these sales in 2015 compared to only a partial quarter in the prior-year period. The profit from the production of this ammonia continues to reside in the equity and earnings of operating affiliates line of our income statement.","In the first quarter, we had realized losses on gas hedges of $33 million. These hedges were entered into during the third quarter of 2014 when gas prices were near $4 per MMBtu. However, as gas production increased and spot and NYMEX prices decreased, we benefited, as the first-of-month settlement prices dropped to around $2.50 per MMBtu at the beginning of April and May.","We believe North American gas producers have exceptional efficiencies and are driving innovations to continue increasing their production capacity while decreasing their costs. However, as Tony mentioned, we also believe that the current gas price environment presents a good opportunity to take some cost risk off the table for the rest of 2015.","In accordance with this view, we decided to hedge 50% of our total gas needs for April through December, with 4.2 million MMBtus per month or about 20% of our needs hedged with collars between $2.30 and $3.20 per MMBtu and 6.5 million MMBtus per month or about 30% of our needs swapped at $2.86 per MMBtu. Additionally, we believe the forward curve out into 2016 also looks compelling at this time. We have chosen to hedge about 4 million MMBtus per month for January through October of 2016 with an average strike price of $3.04 per MMBtu.","We continue to monitor and evaluate the gas market and will look at appropriate additional opportunities to hedge our gas exposure. The decline in our gas costs has been coincident with the decline in oil-based energy costs worldwide. Oil prices have since stabilized around $65 per barrel Brent. While the decline in oil prices is providing some cost relief to producers buying gas on oil in contracts, these producers are not the marginal production for urea. That continues to be Chinese producers using anthracite coal, which at recent mine mouth average prices of about $130 per metric ton, has been relatively stable.","Our capital expenditures during the quarter totaled $445 million, with $318 million spent on the expansion projects. And as Tony highlighted, as of May 1, we have repurchased about 1.3 million shares since the beginning of the year. We returned $377 million to shareholders through these repurchases and further increased our nitrogen capacity to about 143 tons per 1,000 shares.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dennis. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, despite difficult weather and market conditions. And we are well positioned for another strong quarter in Q2. The global cost curve continues to provide an accurate model of how the industry operates, and North America is clearly the advantaged location for nitrogen production.","We are executing well, and our business is producing reliable, sustainable cash flows. We are delivering on our strategy to increase cash flow per share by increasing nitrogen capacity per share, which will see a dramatic increase as we bring on our new capacity additions beginning in Q3 of this year.","Although our shares have dramatically outperformed all of our peers, as shown on slide 13, given the substantial growth in nitrogen capacity per share we are about to experience, there is still an awful lot of runway left for us.","Finally, I would like to congratulate and thank our operating team and the plants and distribution facilities for keeping their eyes on the tasks at hand and keeping themselves and each other safe. It is a great accomplishment to work safely while running our facilities as hard as we are. Keep up the great work.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a courtesy to others on the call, we ask you to limit yourself to two questions. Should you have additional questions, we ask that you reenter the queue, and we will answer additional questions as time allows. And the first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Can I just ask you, as you think about what's happened with Chinese exports this year and the change in the tariff policy or the lack of a seasonality to it, right, so it's flat all year long. Do you envision, one, that exports will decelerate as we move through the year? And two, just as we saw probably weaker pricing in the first quarter as a result of an increased amount of exports, if we see fewer exports year-over-year in later periods \u2013 and I'm thinking maybe during fill season \u2013 do you think we'll have less of a sort of a price decline during seasonally weak periods of time? I hope that makes sense.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Good morning, Vincent. This is Bert. And so it's been an interesting development over the last several years as the Chinese exports have consistently ramped up, peaking last year, we believe. And then the changes that are taking place within China relative to the tariff change, electricity costs, freight costs and then currency issues. And so when I look at what could happen in the coming months with exports being stable, with 4.4 million tons coming out in the first quarter, I would expect it to be a little more stable and probably less. Well, with their lack of participation in the tender and then now trying to set a price floor, it looks like there's some probably more ratable nature taking place within the Chinese production community.","And so in terms of fewer exports or in the later periods and supporting a fill price, I think you're spot on. I think from what the expectation was probably in March, which was the floor of the market to what fill will be to probably what reality will be in Q3, will be at a higher level.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask you, I picked up from one of the trade publications that maybe some of the rainy weather near Donaldsonville had maybe pushed back the start time of the urea facility. Is that correct or incorrect?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, good morning, Vincent. Obviously, when it's real soupy in D'ville, it's hard to get as much progress as we'd like. But we are still absolutely committed to a Q3 start-up, and there's nothing out there that would suggest anything different than that to us today. It might have moved it a week or two later in the quarter than what we had originally desired. It doesn't change the overall sort of rough timing of a Q3 start.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great to hear and great job on the execution. It's really great. Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Bert, a question on your forward order book. You mention that your book is well priced and certainly above some of the lows that we saw in New Orleans. I think you mentioned $280 short ton NOLA on urea.","We've obviously seen a nice rebound in pricing. I think there's a barge yesterday at $335. So how does your book compare to current spot prices? Is it reflective of those current spot prices? And it sounds like you position yourselves that you got a lot of inventory to take advantage of the spot uptick.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. So probably not going to give exact numbers, but we're pleased with that order book because as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we did stay out of the market and kind of set on the sidelines during the market lows. And we've seen, I think, an unexpected, relative to the industry and where inventory was positioned, a nice price increase. And so the price that you quoted, $335 is reasonable for a spot barge in May. And we're even seeing positive pricing out into June and into late June.","And so how does our book compare and with the current market? I think favorably. And we do have inventory, and we're selling into this market and anticipate it to continue probably through June and a little bit later, especially into Indiana and some of the pivot areas through UAN.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Just a follow-up for Tony on share repurchases. Last quarter you, were a little hesitant to repurchase shares until you felt better about the expansions, which \u2013 or at least that's what you said on the call. But as you felt better of the completion, does that mean we can look forward to an acceleration of share repurchase? Or are there any other constraints such as debt levels and ratings that would cause you to hold off on the rate of share repurchase in the current quarter and the balance of the year?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Don. So as you know, the latest repurchase authorization that we're operating under was put in place last July, and it was for $1 billion that run through 2016. We've got about $250 million left on that authorization today. And we're going to go ahead and continue to make as rapid a progress on that as we can, given threading the needle on the issues that you talked about, which is maintaining appropriate liquidity and kind of getting through the discussions with the agencies.","As Dennis mentioned last call and we continue to be focused on, we'd love to go ahead take out some additional debt associated with the new cash flow that's coming on stream with the expansion projects and put that to work at share prices that are woefully low right now and vacuum up as many of those as we can. So we haven't changed our strategy with respect to that.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Last quarter and even this quarter, you talked about stability in Chinese anthracite coal prices. But the data I've looked at year-to-date, I think anthracite coal is down 10%. Thermal coal is down even more. So maybe there's a difference in data. But what do you think is the cash cost of anthracite coal \u2013 urea cash cost of anthracite coal-based producers? Thank you.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. P.J., this is Dennis. We're looking at about $130 at a mine mouth cost right now. And if you look at the slide, I believe it is on page \u2013 just grab it here for you \u2013 look at the slide on page 10, okay? What it shows there is it's about \u2013 it says $132 per ton. It takes approximately 30 MMBtus to 35 MMBtus per ton \u2013 or MMBtus per ton of urea of anthracite coal to make it. And our view is that at the transport cost from mine mouth to the plant is probably, on average around $15 per ton. So if you look at the mathematics there and you add all that up plus the transport to the coast, it's probably going to come in around $310 per short ton NOLA would be the cost of Chinese producers at the current coal prices that we see.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful \u2013 go ahead. Sorry.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. Go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. So my second question was, you guys make a lot of money by making these in-market decisions about when to sell ammonia, urea, UAN and what to sell, the basis difference and all that stuff. That expertise allows you to make more money than you would otherwise make. How do you make those decisions? Is that institutionalized, the process, or is that just Bert making all the calls?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's why Bert gets the big money. No. So Bert and his team \u2013 and I'll turn it over to him just momentarily here \u2013 but we take a very analytical approach to kind of understanding where the market sits. So we try to understand all the factors that go into it. What cash costs are in other parts of the world, what import levels look like coming in to the U.S., what demand centers there are outside the U.S. to soak up some of those tons that are moving around the globe. What producer and downstream inventory positions are, and how many acres are going to be planted and what demand looks like and how we see it developing.","And so Bert and his team take all of that information and put together kind of their view of demand and where they think prices will settle, and then they build the book around and take our positions based on that information. And it just turned out to be prophetic in that approach. It's easier for me to compliment you to have to do it yourself.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Very nice. I think we have a very good team. And the team is united around many of the same issues, and we have a process that's been developed over the years where it's a quantitative view of the market. And the market is an international market. It's not a market share issue. It's not a North America market, but we're playing in a world market and the team is broad.","We have people all around the world through KEYTRADE and as well as with our domestic team with different levels of experiences. But it starts with supply and demand. And then you work your way through from distribution to the international markets to storage assets and distribution capabilities, with different modes and freight options and arbitrages that are available.","And then you have to bring in the whole customer dynamic of psychology and thinking around and risk and reward as well as timing with what they're thinking, acres. And then the last one is probably our production options on. We have many different products or legs of the stool that our company stands on with urea, ammonia, UAN, ammonium nitrate, DEF.","And so when you look at the production mixes, that gives us a lot of optionality and we're building even more advantages into the company with these new production plants. And so when you put that all out before you and you have those types of choices, it allows us to be successful. And we enjoy the position that we have.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you for the detailed color. Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first question for Dennis on the gas hedging going a bit further out on the gas hedges, both in 2015 and 2016, than has been the recent experience. And maybe at a higher-level walkthrough kind of the institutional approach to gas hedging. And is it just a market view on the natural gas market or the risk approach on your cost base? Walk us through the considerations you make when you step further out on the hedging.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Adam, I'm going to go ahead and ask Chris Bohn, who's with us on the call today, who handles all of our gas procurement and supply logistics to address that one.","Christopher D. Bohn - Senior Vice President-Supply Chain","Yeah. Good morning, Adam. As far as our philosophy on natural gas hedging, it really hasn't changed. We believe that there's still very strong North American natural gas fundamentals, and that's due to the immense resource space we have and then the declining production costs that we're seeing specifically over the last six months.","And if you recall, our strategy is really underpinned by two points. One is to mitigate risk. And a lot of the hedging we did last year was to mitigate the weather risk when we see saw some of those drastic spikes. And then additionally, was to lock in attractive prices. And I would say that's really where, given the strong fundamentals and the flattening of the curve, where we're participating today.","The positions we have in place for 2015, we feel very comfortable with where we're participating all the way down to $2.30 for 70% of our production requirements. So that's great. Looking out into 2016, we just saw some very attractive rates at the $3.04 and decided to move in to those.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe a second question on UAN. And I think earlier this spring, you saw a pretty wide kind of price disparity on an N equivalent basis between UAN and urea. That since narrowed somewhat. Maybe talk about what you're seeing with customers, if that price spread has really driven some switching between the products and how you think about that premium moving forward.","Christopher D. Bohn - Senior Vice President-Supply Chain","Yeah. So the spread that we saw was driven by a couple of different issues, and ammonia stayed fairly steady from Q4 into Q1 and now through Q2. But it was urea that we saw a worldwide drop and again, as we mentioned earlier, driven by the excess of Chinese exports and the imports that arrived into North America.","UAN, with the fill programs that we've put in place and then the subsequent sales, I'd say, blocks that we did in Q4 and into Q1, we're able to sustain the price level of UAN. We believe in UAN. It's got a, we believe, a pretty positive future not only for this year but in the future years, just because it's such a great product and its versatility agronomically. And so we believe that the retail as well as the farmers segment, will continue to be attracted to that because of the advantages it offers to the farmer. And they're willing to pay more for it.","And so, yes, it has narrowed for two reasons. UAN has come off a little bit as we've gone through Q2; and urea has come up. And so \u2013 but the premiums in market on the retail level to the farmer has stayed pretty consistent. It's really on the NOLA and the inferior (30:26) production or the producer to the retail and wholesale segment that was pretty wide.","Regarding switching \u2013 and we talk about this each year \u2013 we haven't seen a lot. As I mentioned, we have \u2013 probably, we will not hit the record ammonia level that we did last year, just due to the fact or the impact of less inventory available to sell. That being said, ammonia, even at a price spread to urea and UAN has been \u2013 it's been a positive six months or at least, now we're in the fifth month \u2013 but a positive two quarters. And I think we're going to see that for both urea and UAN also as we go forward.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Great. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","And our next questions come from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you very much for taking my call. You started the year with lower ammonia inventories, and you mentioned the first half should be lower in terms of deliveries versus the first half of 2014. But given the recent price action in Midwest ammonia and also strong April plantings and some key anhydrous states, can you just give any color on how you're positioned to further benefit from your production versatility, specifically, versus urea?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Chris, I'll give you just some high level and then I'll ask Bert to further opine on topics that I missed. But if you go into the segment results, even though there's great performance that we've had on our ammonia business this year, our profitability per nutrient ton is better on the upgraded products than it is on ammonia. So to the extent that we can upgrade ammonia into urea and then further upgrade it into UAN, every time we upgrade ammonia, we get more margin for those same molecules of nitrogen. So that's a better decision for us.","So in some ways, us continuing to run our upgraded plants as hard as we can has a double benefit. The first one is we get more margin on the products that we're upgrading to. And the second one is it means that you don't get sloppy in terms of the total amount of ammonia that's out there, which means that's it's a tighter ammonia market. And the prices then are that much higher on ammonia as well. So it's kind of the gift that keeps on giving. Bert, you have any other...","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","I think relative to the issue or specific to ammonia, this year, we had just a great run in terms of how it began in the South, and then we had some weather issues. But the Western Corn Belt kicked off with Nebraska running very, very hard. And then as it moved east into Iowa and Illinois, that's when the North started kicking off in North Dakota and Canada, which is still going very well.","And so it allowed us, for the distribution assets for that incremental ton, to get it in market and focus. This is where our supply team did a great job, and the distribution team running 24\/7, putting the product in some specific terminals with the pipes and our barges and having product available. And that was probably one of the key success factors for this period.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just my second question would be just when you look at the volatility of Eastern European supply over the last, let's say, 12 months or so, can you just address your own in-house views on some of the oil and (33:54) contracts there, the timing of it, potential new agreement as it pertains to ammonia? I understand, obviously, only a handful of these producers use those type of contracts, but just any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So a lot of those contracts, Chris, are somewhere in the six to nine months long, a few of them a little bit longer than that. The other issue around kind of deepwater ammonia or NOLA ammonia, that's relevant for us, I guess, and largely only in two ways.","And while occasionally, we will do an export ammonia cargo that then has to compete on the deepwater ammonia market, generally, the places where it really comes into play is the price at which we buy ammonia out of Trinidad and then the turnaround and the price at which we sell it to Mosaic in Tampa. The deepwater ammonia price doesn't really affect the in-market ammonia price too much because there's no availability, really, for traders to be able to move ammonia up and into Corn Belt because they don't have the storage assets. So it doesn't affect really our ammonia business that much, other than on the industrial side. But...","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Chris. The other thing is just looking at nitrogen more broadly and thinking about urea. And if you look at slide nine in our deck, it's got our updated version of the cost curve for urea. And what you'll notice about that versus prior cost curves that we were showing when oil prices were at $100 a barrel is that some of the smaller columns related to Eastern Europe and Western European production have moved left from where they had been before to reflect the fact or to reflect the effect, to the degree there is an effect, of reduced oil prices on the ability to produce.","But when you step away from those movements, you'll see that, A), those columns are not very thick on the graph; and, B), at the end of the day, the marginal producer still is the anthracite coal producer in China. And that sort of remains unchanged. So as we think about oil prices and the effect that they really had in our business, the answer to that is not very much.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Carl Chen stepping in for Ben. Thank you for taking my question. So just wanted to circle back with regards to your expectation for the spring. How much of the Q4 pent-up demand do you expect to be shifted into the spring of this year? And looking forward, how should we think about the summer fill program given the limited producer inventory?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Okay. The expectation for the first half is very positive. We're projecting 89 million to 90 million acres of corn, and we're seeing healthy applications. So above 180 pounds per acre for corn, and you're seeing possibly some switching in the southeast. It's been very wet in that area, but that corn acreage area is pretty small. Positive rice acres coming in.","And so the expectation for us in terms of how the rest of the quarter, Q2, will progress, we believe that inventories will come out of the quarter low for all products. And we think the industry will be in the same position as well as the wholesale and retail sector. And that will set up then a positive start to the fill season. We don't really anticipate a fill season for urea. We've never really done that. It's more as the market progresses, and again, as we've mentioned earlier, it's more of an internationally driven area.","Ammonia, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are bringing on the production in Q3 and Q4 for the expansions in Donaldsonville. And so the excess ammonia or the extra ammonia that we would have put out into a fill program probably will not be put out or the degree that we have in the past. And then we will prepare for Q4.","For fill, then, focused on the last product, would be UAN. And traditionally, we've had very successful fill programs that are driven by the need to logistically move the product into place with our retail customer base. And we're working with them. We'll start probably working on that in June with an expected later period start. And we think it'll go well.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Dan, congratulations again on the new title.","Daniel Swenson - Treasurer","Thank you.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure thing. Couple questions for you. First, if we're going to hover around this 89 million-acre level of corn planting here in the U.S. and that effectively caps the total demand for nitrogen here. What steps do you need to take, do you think, to maintain your edge in distribution that we've talked about, if this really becomes a matter of market share, ex your expansions? Are there any partnerships or tie-ups or others asset investments that you're going to need to do, particularly, if we get competitors' projects in the Midwest starting up in 2017, 2018?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Matthew. Couple of things, so even after all of the capacity projects that are in flight come on stream, so the most notable of those are our two projects. North America will continue to import about 20% of our total nitrogen requirements. So really, what we're doing is, for the most part, kicking out the majority of imported products. Now we will periodically do an export cargo here or there, but North America will continue to be an import-driven marketplace for the foreseeable future.","We have entered into, as you said, a couple of longer-term, more partnership kinds of relationships with companies like Mosaic for ammonia and Orica on ammonium nitrate supply. And so those are things that we continue to evaluate and look at. But day in and day out, we don't see in the near term there being a dramatic change in the way that we go to market and the way that we do business.","We also have the largest, most expensive distribution asset base in North America. We intend to continue to leverage that to full effect. Bert, do you have any other sort of thoughts?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. I think going back to \u2013 even if acres have been capped and, actually, over the last five years, we've seen a fairly narrow band of corn acres from 90 million to 98 million. And even in the 98 million year, not all of that was planted. So I'd say we're probably in a 90 million to 95 million acre band. And so we've effectively been capped.","And so where that goes then is our product mix and where we take our products, how we move our products, what product we're producing, the growth of DEF and the whole industrial side has been positive to CF. How we've moved our contracts with the Mosaic contract and the Orica contract moving to some long-term contracts that secure the liability of some of our ammonia as well as ammonium nitrate movement.","And as Tony mentioned, just how we seamlessly move products through the market, how we can store and bridge different markets, it maximizes our efficiency. And the last two things are our people. We think we have a great team that are working with our customers to be able to move our products.","You mentioned distribution. Some of our industry colleagues have focused on gaining distribution in different markets in Brazil or India or different places. I'd say at this point, we're not looking at that, but we have great relationships out in the world and we'll continue to move our products.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matthew, one other thing, which is global demand for nitrogen is growing at about 2% per year. A lot of that, at least with respect to the U.S., is going to be on the industrial side, in particular, DEF. But there are few other places where that will continue to grow as well.","And so even though nitrogen from an ag-application perspective may be relatively constant, there are other places that we're looking to, to be able to move that product into. So it's nice to be participating in a market with pretty sustained overall growth characteristics on a global basis. That's a good dynamic to be in.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, John (sic) [Tony] (42:36). Then let me follow up with this, then. How many tons of product are you currently selling into the non-ag market? Because I noticed your mention of good sales into the emissions abatement market, I was wondering if that's a short-term bump from the new MATS standards or something else and whether that should be ongoing.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean think about it as kind of two-thirds, one-third, in rough order of magnitude. It's about two-thirds into the ag market and about one-third into the industrial and other kinds of application. Now embedded in industrial, we would put the ammonia contract with Mosaic. We'd put the ammonium nitrate contract with Orica. Those are clearly non-ag-related sorts of contracts. So you bundle all that together, it's about a third of our business.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Tony, as you think about the new UAN capacity and the rest of the capacity at Donaldsonville, do you anticipate having a ready market for all that capacity at the beginning? I guess I'm trying to think about the competitive dynamic with the imports at the new OCI plant and how much the market has to adjust. And related to that, how do you think about the importance of that plan in the context of the overall expansion at Donaldsonville?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So one of the things we did at D'ville is to build a pretty big acid plant, 1,500 tons a day. That gives us an opportunity to really grow into that acid plant as the market continues, on a global basis, to develop and use more UAN. And we are seeing signs of global growth in demand and acceptance of that product in Latin America and other places as well. So we expect UAN to be kind of a product that continues to get traction on the global stage.","But we also put in the capacity to be able to granulate 100% of the new urea plant and basically turn the acid plant off if we wanted to. So we've got terrific product flexibility in terms of configuration of mix coming out of D'ville going forward. And our belief at the beginning was we won't be running the acid plant full out from a UAN perspective, and we'll be able to dial it up and down as the market requires.","But I think right now, between the various UAN capacity additions coming online in the U.S. with Weaver and then D'ville, that takes up most of what the U.S. imports in the way of UAN. There's still a little bit of headroom there. But we can dial that up and dial it down as needed. We are also evaluating other uses for that acid plant, whether it be industrial sales of nitric acid to other people and so forth so we can get full asset utilization out of that investment. But I think it's a critical piece overall in terms of our network because it gives us a lot of flexibility to be able to go urea, go UAN and move the product into the interior and\/or export it as market conditions warrant.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning. I just wanted to touch base a little bit on Trinidad and how you see the gas availability issues playing out over the next couple of years. And then second, sort of the follow-up question is, as your supply agreement with Mosaic kicks in, how big of a deal is the Trinidad negotiations with the phosphate manufacturers going to be in terms of determining the cap on (46:39) global ammonia prices? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, good morning, Michael. I'll answer the second question first, and I'll kick it over to Chris to talk about Trinidad gas. But on the Mosaic side, the Trinidad product that we moved to Mosaic, I believe that contract runs through 2018. And there's a potential to extend that as appropriate from both sides.","Now that contract, we're basically buying product out of the partnership in Trinidad at a market-based price and then we're selling it to Mosaic at a market-based price. As Dennis said, we are getting 100% of the profit; it just doesn't show up in the ammonia segment. It shows up below the line in the equity interest in subs. And so that one is very much at play with respect to what's going on in the global ammonia marketplace and the pricing.","The agreement that we have with Mosaic for production coming out of the Donaldsonville plant is on a gas-plus basis to guarantee us a mid-teens kind of return on our investment at Donaldsonville. So what pricing happens at Tampa or the Gulf or anywhere else is irrelevant with respect to the Donaldsonville ammonia agreement, and that's the one that starts on January 1 of 2017.","So that's the Mosaic piece. And then, Chris, do you want to handle the Trinidad gas?","Christopher D. Bohn - Senior Vice President-Supply Chain","Yeah. Michael, on the Trinidad gas, in the near term here throughout 2015, our expectation is to see somewhere averaging around 15% to maybe 20% of gas curtailment. There'll be peaks and valleys based on that. A lot of that is based on when turnarounds are going. If we know there's going to be a large gas curtailment, the producing players down there are managing their turnarounds to be during that period, so others aren't affected as much. But we would expect for the remaining part of the year to see that type of gas curtailment.","Michael L. Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Terrific. Thanks. And then just one last question. If urea prices do roll over in the summer and return to levels that we saw a month ago, I mean what type of ability do some of the international producers have to flex capacity between ammonia and urea? Or do you think the guys who produced urea are still going to remain producing urea? And I'm thinking the non-Chinese producers in this instance. Thanks. Bye.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Michael, I'll give you quick thoughts and then ask Bert to chime in as well. I mean producers, generally speaking, always have the option of not upgrading into urea and trying to sell ammonia. The issue is there's a relatively fixed amount of demand on the sort of deep-sea ammonia-traded market.","And you start bringing on too much additional supply into that marketplace, and you'll see a pretty quick price drop. And so \u2013 and also, again, if you kind of go back and look at how we do segment reporting by products, we get more margin per nutrient ton for urea, even at prices in sort of low $300s than we do for in-market ammonia at $570.","So there is a pretty healthy upgrade margin for people moving ammonia into urea, and then you've got a much more liquidity in terms of the urea-traded market than you do in ammonia. So our view is the people that are making urea will likely continue to make urea even at $280 a short ton NOLA. It's just, there's still more margin available there than selling it at $450 or $425 deep-sea traded ammonia.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. The only additional comment is you do have two different markets on ammonia with east versus west and what has been happening out of the AG with ammonia shipments in the east (51:05) and different values. But you also have to factor in \u2013 because ammonia is a little bit of a different bird with where the vessels are and how many vessels are committed to a certain area and the milk runs that they run. But we do see some positive developments in the caprolactam production, phosphate production, so the demand basis for ammonia should be there for both east and west. But I agree with Tony on the upgrades. And their storage facilities that they have to load deep-sea vessels, it's much easier and the value's there for them to continue to upgrade.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about kind of the ag backdrop and kind of what you're seeing or expecting in terms supply and demand for corn and kind of ending stocks as we move through the year?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Bert, you want handle that?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. So some good developments in terms of how we're seeing planting progress and the moisture profiles that are available as well as the weather patterns that are developing look very positive for corn development as well as soybeans if \u2013 we prefer corn, though, because of nitrogen demand. And so ending stocks, we've been in the 13.5% to 14% stocks-to-use ratio range. We expect with the trend-line yield of 165 to probably continue in that same vein, staying around the 13% to 14% basis level.","You see some good demand for ethanol. We think that, that will continue to move forward as well as exports, maybe 1 billion gallons of ethanol for the year, maintaining that trend, 800 million to 1 billion. And so that works for good production levels. And so when you look at the price for protein and the values for DDGs and the values for ethanol and the ability to export that incremental gallon, it sets up a very positive demand trend for corn and, we think, higher planting levels. So I wouldn't be surprised, we've been in the 89 million to 90 million, to see actual corn acres be on the positive side.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thanks. That's really good color. Just then kind of switching to the buybacks, just wondering as you kind of get through the existing authorization, any discussions around a new repurchase authorization?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We want to finish up what we have authorization for before we get into the next chapter. But again, I think if you look at the sustainable nature of the cash flow generation that we're producing \u2013 and in fact, even if you look at the margin structure of nitrogen or, said differently, the margin structure of North American producer of nitrogen, it's way above where the margin structure in the long-term outlook is for phosphate. And it's basically on par with potash.","So until we start trading at a potash kind of multiple, given that the sustainable nature of our cash flow and our margin structure is equal to that of potash, you can assume that we will be in the marketplace buying our shares down because we just have a different view of, again, the sustainable nature of the cash flows than other people do. So even though we haven't gotten there yet, that's probably where we're headed next.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's great. Thanks a lot, Tony. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thank you. A quick question. How do you think about the impact of precision agriculture on nitrogen demand? There were some reports from the past growing season that farmers were able to be more economical in terms of their application rates by using some of these advisory services.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Sandy, I'll give you kind of my two cents and then I'll turn it over to Bert, who's got more expertise in this area. But the way we view precision ag is, it's going to be more efficient use of the nutrients that are put down, which doesn't necessarily equate to less overall nutrients. It just means that you'll end up getting likely less losses to the environment and you'll get more yield for the nutrients that are put down. And so what that may end up leading to is that you get crop production in those areas that are best able to produce those particular types of crops.","So for instance, corn in the U.S. will make a lot more sense when you're able to do consistently 180 to 200 bushels per acre than it does to try to raise corn in Brazil or sections of Brazil where you've got all kinds of logistical challenges and you don't get nearly the yield. So in terms of our home demand center here in our production area, we don't necessarily see that translating into a reduction in overall nutrient use. It's more a pickup in efficiency. But Bert, you want to...?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","I think you're exactly right. It's a whole component for precision ag; seed protection, nutrients, timing. And we're working closely with the GROWMARKs, the Country Ops (56:44), the CPSs of the world, the Helenas. They're intimately involved with that, and it's the attempt to improve the financial performance of each farmer.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And just a follow-up on an earlier question on industrial nitrogen demand. Apologize if you already answered this, but how do you see that one-third, two-thirds split evolving over the next five years? And in particular, how do you think about the longer-term market potential for DEF demand?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. In terms of the rough, as Tony mentioned, one-third, two-thirds, I think that's a good place to be. If we see a different return profile to the industrial market, we'll be more aggressive in the industrial market.","What we've done in the past from the last five years is we've moved from the Terra acquisition, we moved more into the agricultural market because that was to our advantage with our distribution assets and where our production assets were located.","It was just a natural for us to leverage our platform. As we've grown and as we're adding capacity and as we've developed some relationships, again, with Mosaic and Orica, more of the industrial side was attractive. We improved that contract that we inherited from the Terra acquisition.","DEF's got a very positive growth profile, both from integer and the industry forecasts as well as our internals. You're seeing dosing grades go from 2.5 now \u2013 after 2016 to 5.5 and project to possibly to 7.5. And so with that, with the efficiency gains that are achieved, as well as the positive emission impact, DEF probably has a very long runway.","Sandy H.

My name is Vin. I will be your coordinator for today.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick, with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries' third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President-Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, our CEO; Dennis Kelleher, our CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its third quarter 2017 results yesterday afternoon, as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session.","Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now, let me introduce our President and CEO, Tony Will.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter of 2017, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $134 million, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","I am particularly pleased with our performance and results for the quarter, especially considering how the quarter began with prices meaningfully below 2016 levels. As nitrogen prices rose from the unsustainable lows of the summer, our team responded extremely well, dramatically ramping up shipments and capturing the improving prices. Our team demonstrated impressive execution across all parts of the business.","Operationally, our plants ran really well once again. We produced 2.5 million tons of gross ammonia, but most importantly, we did it safely. Our 12-month recordable incident rate was down to 0.85 incidents per 200,000 work hours. Our team has also achieved more than 3 million hours without a lost-time injury. This is a tremendous achievement considering the level of activity across our system.","Our sales volume was the second highest quarterly volume ever. This is particularly impressive, because the third quarter is historically a lower volume quarter for us due to the seasonality of applications in North America. During the quarter, we participated in the North American in-region demand, sparingly at first, but with increased enthusiasm as prices rose. This included our successful UAN summer fill program.","We also leveraged Donaldsonville's ability to export to a greater extent than ever before as North American nitrogen prices remained below global parity. During the third quarter, we exported 1 million product tons, which is a new CF record for any quarter. These export sales allowed us to balance our system and manage inventory positions to maximize overall margins.","When North American customers were unwilling to purchase products at netbacks comparable to international prices, we increased exports and built inventory by pulling back from selling in North America. As prices began to recover, we chose to sell more actively and were able to capture better pricing on very strong volume.","Our export capability combined with our extensive inventory and distribution network are unique to CF, and are critical elements to maximizing cash generation in this business. We have also additional ability to grow export volumes even further should North America continue to trade below international parity.","As I have mentioned, global nitrogen prices strengthened significantly during the quarter from the unsustainable lows of July, producers in high-cost regions curtailed production, and global supply was also reduced by planned and unplanned outages in a variety of regions. When demand increased during the quarter, especially in Brazil and India, product was in limited supply and global prices rose. Prices in North America rose as well, but remained below international parity, and global trade flows rapidly adjusted to this pricing discount.","During the third quarter, far less imported product arrived in North America than in the first half of this year or the same period in 2016. In fact, North America was a net exporter of urea in July, and approximately net neutral on imports-exports for the third quarter as a whole. The significant price fluctuations we have experienced in 2017 are symptoms of a market in transition, as new capacity ramps up and global trade flows adjust, and this transition is not yet complete.","This is particularly true in North America, where we expect the final set of capacity additions to ramp up to full rates by mid-2018. Should the importers not fully take this additional capacity into account, we could end up retesting the nitrogen pricing lows we saw in the spring and summer of 2017. However, after we get through 2018, we continue to expect global demand growth to exceed new capacity growth and set the stage for a more sustained nitrogen price recovery.","We believe our performance this quarter demonstrates how CF is the best positioned company to benefit from the recovery. Our operational advantages, absolute scale, production flexibility, significant in-region storage, and export optionality allow us to set volume records and maximize cash margins in a period of seasonally low demand in North America.","Our structural advantages, access to low-cost North American natural gas, operating in the import-dependent North American region, and the long-term demand growth for nitrogen are well established and enduring. Taken together, we believe CF will benefit disproportionately from the improving price environment we see ahead of us.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk more about the commercial environment during the quarter and our forward view. Then, Dennis will discuss our financial results before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. CF's performance in the third quarter demonstrated the strength and agility of our team and the system. We shifted our product mix when needed, employed our logistics and storage assets, and carefully selected opportunities of when and where to sell. As a result, we maximized the overall cash margin available to us, while achieving close to record shipments. We believe we are positioned very well going into spring 2018.","The quarter began with NOLA urea trading at approximately $155 to $160 per short ton. These price levels were the lowest seen in a decade, excluding 2009, and we're at or below full production costs for many producers around the world. Prices remain low through July with the expectation that the quarter would close at similar pricing levels. However, the continued low level of Chinese production and exports, combined with a weaker U.S. dollar, and energy and production cost increases in various areas of the world, helped to lift prices through August and then move higher in September. As we exited the quarter, urea prices around the globe continue to show strength supported by low inventories and higher than expected demand in India and Brazil. However, North America lagged the rest of the world in terms of pricing and demand throughout the quarter.","While urea prices followed the sharp upward trajectory, ammonia and UAN did not increase as dramatically. CF again achieved very solid export volumes for UAN and ammonia and a record level for urea. Late in the second quarter and early third quarter, the netback available from international destinations increased and exceeded the netbacks available for domestic shipments. The team was able to pivot to exports and build a book for the various products that allowed CF to load and ship record volumes at favorable values.","We exported 200,000 tons of urea, 300,000 tons of ammonia and almost 0.5 million tons of UAN. These shipments allowed us to improve our results in three ways. First, we delayed the launch of our UAN fill program, so we could capture higher prices for June and July applications. Second, we did not participate in the extremely low ammonia prices initially offered, by some, for fall applications. And third, we were patient with urea sales and were able to capture higher values later in the quarter.","Additionally, Mosaic began taking ammonia shipments from Donaldsonville early in September at the contract price, which was favorable to prices available for either domestic or export destinations. Going forward, the amount of ammonia we expect to have available for export will decline significantly due to the supply agreement with Mosaic.","Now, let me provide some thoughts on our broader outlook. The global market remains in a period of transition as new capacity comes online and global trade flows adjust. These changes make it harder for participants to interpret market signals, and this leads to greater volatility. Buyers in North America remain risk averse with more purchasing in a just-in-time manner or selling and purchasing back-to-back. They also appear to be keeping lower inventories through the year.","All of these changes play to the strength of our North American production and distribution network. They also make import options less attractive as internationally sourced material often involves longer lead times and importers bearing significant inventory risk. In any case, we will continue to work with our longtime customers as well as our growing list of new customers to meet these challenges and deliver tons to the right areas at the right time, utilizing storage and adjusting product mix. We have demonstrated our ability to do just that, and are well-positioned as the global nitrogen market continues to transition.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. The company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.37 and EBITDA of $139 million for the third quarter. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted diluted loss per share for the third quarter was $0.39, and adjusted EBITDA was $134 million. Our adjustments included a $7 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives.","I want to highlight the cost reductions we have achieved across our system. This is a result of our targeted efforts to reduce costs in our head office and in our plants. Our SG&A was roughly flat compared to the same period last year, demonstrating the scalability of our business model. We increased our capacity by about 25% and sales volume by 33% since last year without incurring significant incremental head office costs.","In fact, despite adding significant production, we have among the lowest SG&A as a percentage of sales in the fertilizer space and commodity chemicals generally as you can see on slide 12. Looking at SG&A on a per ton basis, we reduced SG&A per product ton by 23% since 2015.","At our manufacturing sites, reduced plant level activity and better procurement practices have decreased professional services, payroll and maintenance cost, resulting in a lower controllable cost of sales.","As you can see on slide 11, we have reduced controllable cost of sales per product ton by almost $12 compared to third quarter 2016 and more than $15 on a year-to-date basis.","Our balance sheet remains strong. Our cash and cash equivalents are $2 billion as of the end of September \u2013 as of September 30, and our $750 million revolving credit facility was undrawn.","Monday, we announced that we will redeem the May 2018 bonds on December 1, 2017. We estimate that the total cash payment will be approximately $817 million. This action fulfills the commitment we made over a year ago to redeem these bonds with cash and reduce our annual cash interest expense by $55 million.","Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2017 were $105 million. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $375 million for new activities in 2017.","Additionally, as of September 30, 2017, approximately $158 million remained accrued, but unpaid related to the capacity expansion activities in 2016. Most of this unpaid amount originated from disputes with certain contractors and vendors.","On our second quarter earnings call, we provided our thoughts concerning the third quarter and our view that it was unlikely that we would exceed prior-year's adjusted EBITDA. This was based on our view that the benefits of higher volumes and lower controllable costs would be more than offset by higher gas costs and lower product prices, and the July's sales volume is somewhat driven by the poor pricing environment, were fairly low.","Compared to that starting point, prices, particularly for urea improved dramatically in August and September as Bert described. Additionally, our team took advantage of rising prices and offshore demand to sell and ship approximately 300,000 product tons of more than we expected. We also achieved greater cost reductions than we expected. As a result, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in substantially above our expectations at the time of the second quarter call.","I will now provide some specific thoughts regarding our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2017, understanding that this too is subject to changes in market conditions. We expect to see higher volumes and lower controllable costs per ton compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. We also expect higher nitrogen prices across all products and for gas cost per MMBtu to be essentially flat compared to the same period last year.","However, I'd like to point out a few things worth mentioning. First, quarterly sales volumes are difficult to predict, and we believe it is better to think in terms of 6-month or 12-month timeframes. It may turn out that some of the robust volumes we achieved in the third quarter pulled forward volumes that we otherwise would have sold in the fourth quarter.","Second, some of the volume we sold in October was priced before the price went up in the third quarter had fully materialized.","And lastly, the fall ammonia season is just beginning in much of the Corn Belt. A growers' decision to apply ammonia is very sensitive to weather condition during a narrow window of time. Therefore, a significant amount of volume and price risk for ammonia remains in the fourth quarter.","So, based on our view of all of these factors today, we believe it is likely that our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 will exceed $133 million of adjusted EBITDA reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we open the call to questions, I want to highlight a couple of things. First, our business has demonstrated its resiliency, even during the most difficult environment our industry has seen in over a decade. Slide 13 shows how we've grown cash on the balance sheet by $828 million through the first three quarters of the year.","Even excluding the federal tax refund we received in the second quarter, along with a one-time voluntary contribution to our pension program, we increased net cash by $72 million. This means the cash we generated even during this challenging period has more than covered our fixed charges, including CapEx, interest, dividends, and distributions to non-controlling interests.","With the bond repayment Dennis mentioned, we will further reduce the interest portion of fixed charges by $55 million per year. The second item I want to highlight has been our team's execution over the last 15 months.","On slide 26, we compare the achievements discussed today to the commitments we made on our August 2016 conference call. At that time, we laid out four targets for the business. First, complete and start up the expansion projects by the end of 2016. Second, reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million in 2017. Third, reduce our controllable expenses. And fourth, reduce leverage on the balance sheet by repaying $800 million of debt due in May 2018.","Our team's efforts have yielded excellent results on all four targets. We completed the expansion projects by the end of 2016, and all new units are reliably running more than 15% above nameplate capacity. New CapEx in 2017 is expected to be approximately $375 million. We have reduced controllable expenses per ton by 16% and SG&A per ton by approximately 23% year-to-date.","Finally, earlier this week, we announced that we will redeem the 2018 bonds early, reducing our leverage. Importantly, we achieved all of this with excellent safety performance. Given the heightened level of production and shipping activity over this period, along with normal turnarounds and maintenance, that is an outstanding accomplishment.","With that, operator, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a courtesy to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. If you have additional questions, we ask that you re-enter the queue, we will answer additional questions as time allows. Our first question is from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Maybe first, for Tony, just some thoughts on the market, and really product pricing and premiums, as you've seen them evolve over the third quarter, and really this year, where the U.S. has continued to trade at a sustainable discount to the rest of the world, the UAN since the summer has traded at a discount to urea, which is fairly unusual. Can you talk about kind of how you think those evolve what \u2013 in particular, for the UAN premium gets that reversed, and how to think about your own realizations against that construct with your realizations versus benchmarks are actually quite good this quarter?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Adam. This is Bert. And the market has evolved in a little bit of a strange way, coming off the lows as we mentioned of urea. And looking at that point in July when we were at $155, $160, and launching our UAN fill program at the end of July to where we are today is remarkable. The market is up close to $100 in North America, and internationally, even more.","And you're right, we're trading at a discount to the world as frustrating as that is. But I do think that's a reflection of this transitionary period that we've been discussing, where we have a little bit of a stop-and-go-type market with purchases and positioning. And so, we become adept at accessing all markets at all times and in conversations with customers around the world. And working with different customer partners to move our product at the margins that we deem appropriate.","And so, when you look forward for product pricing, we're positive to what's taking place around the world. There are still capacity to come up in North America, and there's idled capacity in different parts of the world that will probably come up off of turnarounds and maintenance in \u2013 late in Q4, Q1. But we've seen robust demand to support that. And this current situation in India with the tender that is just closed and been priced, we think is attractive. You still have a few more months of Brazilian activity, as they prepare for a second crop corn planting in February and March. So, imports will arrive probably into early February there. And then you have the North America season starting at that point with a significant amount of imports still to take place to support planting in spring.","Relative to the UAN summer fill program, we are very pleased. The team did a great job of working with our customers, broadening our customer base, our geographic imprint. But, you're right, UAN has traded at a discount to urea, and that is historically an anomaly. And we do see that over time and believe that UAN as the, we believe, a very good product will return to its premium status, but that may take a while as we talk about this transition year in 2018.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other thing I want to just add that \u2013 a point that Bert makes off and on the UAN side, which is below urea is kind of ubiquitously traded. UAN is principally only used in a few markets, so you've got North America, a couple of markets in Europe and Argentina. We're just beginning in Brazil and a few other places. But there's much less international demand for it.","And with the new Donaldsonville plant operating at over 6,000 tons a day, that's over 2 million tons of capacity we brought on. Weaver has brought on more than a 1 million tons, and because at Port Neal, we were urea-limited in terms of our UAN, with the new urea plant we've brought on, we've added a couple of hundred thousand tons of UAN capacity in Iowa as well.","So, when you look at that, the U.S. has added 3 million, 3.5 million tons of capacity. That's a huge percentage increase. And I think it's just going to take a little while for the marketplace to absorb that, before you see the urea UAN kind of pricing premium renormalize.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And that is the benefit of, as we talked, about our product agility or product mix configuration. We can produce all that Tony talked about or move some of that to dry urea, liquid urea, DEF, and we're balancing utilizing those different tools.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Carson of Susquehanna, your line is open.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Bert, a question on just the domestic market. I mean, to what extent was some of this price rise we saw in Q3 kind of a scramble by dealers to source product as they saw that Enid and Weaver weren't going to fully ramp? And what's your view on the premium between NOLA and the Corn Belt on urea, UAN and ammonia as we go forward? I mean, should your strong exports maintain that premium or do you think it comes down with all the new capacity in market?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, looking at the premium today, I'll answer that part first, it's holding, and we're positive to the premium. There is a direct cost to move product, no matter if you're moving it from Galveston or NOLA or the East and West Coast to hit the consumption markets from, let's say, Ohio to Nebraska, the Dakotas to Texas. And we're fully intent on that premium holding, because again, there is a cost.","Now, ammonia has had some lower prices in historical, in terms of the spreads, in terms of the absolute product values as a divisor based on their nutrient content. I think that's an anomaly also. I think as we balance this, a few of the producers probably had excess ammonia going into the quarter, because the upgrades weren't prepared, and needed to move that product. So, I think this fall is an anomaly based on what will probably happen in the future with ammonia applications for corn.","But you're right, we've seen a nice move in the market. I do think several of our big customers, as well as medium and small customers, did position themselves well at the UAN fill. But we look at as urea, we've had fewer imports and probably fewer produced tons than anticipated. So, I do think there is a market that needs to be fulfilled going into Q2 to be ready for spring. So, I do think there will be some needs and need to be purchasing, as well as logistically moving those tons, over the next, let's say, four to five months. So, that's why we're constructively positive.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Don, let me just add a couple of thoughts to that, which is the U.S. still is going to need the import, another what, Bert, about 3 million tons of urea or so.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I'd say 4 million.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","4 million tons. So, you can't get there if North Africa is trading at a significant premium to where we're trading. The prices at NOLA eventually have to rise. The other point that I'd make up is, we've demonstrated this last quarter, our ability to export Donaldsonville. So, in a lot of ways, Donaldsonville tons should be considered really an international plant, because we're not going to just pay the transportation cost to move those tons into the Midwest and not recover that cost. We could move those tons into the international marketplace and get better netback.","And so, that's another reason why from our perspective the whole question about whether the Midwest premium hold is a bit of an odd one, because we're not going to incur that cost when we've got other options, and the Midwest is chronically short product even if we put all of the D'Ville stuff up there. So, someone has got to pay the freight to move the product up there. We see no economic reason why there's even a question about the Midwest premium.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Christopher Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Cool. Thanks. You guys have clearly done a pretty solid job reducing controllable costs, but can you comment on whether this was mainly focused D'Ville and Port Neal after the respective ramps, any start up costs, et cetera, or was it fairly broad based across your facilities in the Southern Plains and even Canada? In other words, just how much better do you believe you can get in 2018 and 2019? Thank you.","Christopher D. Bohn - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Chris, this is Chris Bohn. To answer the second part of your question first is that as Tony and Dennis mentioned, these initiatives we put in place last year in the third quarter. So we're beginning to see some lapping of it. So, I would expect that we'll still see some benefit specifically from volumes since we didn't bring on Port Neal till late Q4 last year. So, there'll be some volume benefits that we continue to see.","As far as being focused just at the new expansion projects, I think you're correct in the assumption that this is broad based. What we really did is, we started to focus and be much more diligent on our spending, primarily across professional services, engineering activity and maintenance and payroll expense. And we've seen that come down at all our facilities, so it's not just directed at those two.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Chris, one other just a bit of follow-on there. So, we've got a fair bit of engineering capability at the plants. Historically, we've had a lot of that focused on bottlenecking and improvement on the capacity side. As you know, we've looked at a more difficult market environment, where the value of the incremental ton is perhaps not as high as it used to be. Chris Bohn has done a great job of redirecting that talent base away from improvement which then it begets more CapEx and expense on the professional service side to really focus on maintenance and turnaround activities, so that further reduces our expenses going through those activities. So it's, I'd say, a double benefit that we've been able to achieve there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. You talked a little about ammonia sales are quite strong. You've obviously had a lot of capacity. I think you spoke generally a little about possibly some pull-forward volume for some products in Q4 and Q3. At least for ammonia, was there some pull-forward ammonia? Maybe give a little update on that dynamic. Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","No, it wasn't. The ammonia sales in Q3, Damian did a great job of \u2013 as we talked about this whole export capability and leveraging, where we talk about moving 300,000 tons, in absence of the Mosaic contract which we had planned on, their vessel was late, so we had to pivot and do different things, and one of those was working with some of the destination markets for those sales.","And so, we do have some Ag sales of ammonia in Q3, and majority of that is for weed applications in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas area. And so pulling forward Ag sales in Q3 is pretty difficult, because the corn application have already started by late October and will run through, hopefully end of December. And so, we're anticipating a normal ammonia season, still to be determined. We're looking out the window today in sunny Chicago to rain and clouds. And although we're not in corn country, we are following the weather maps, and it's colder up in the northern territory like the Dakota's, but for great application in Nebraska and Iowa. So, we're anticipating the ammonia season to kick off and be strong for the next 30 days.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ben Gottesdiener - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. This is Ben Gottesdiener on for Steve. Can you discuss your estimates of channel inventory levels of nitrogen in the major grain-growing regions of the world, U.S., Brazil, India, and how that compares to historical levels?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure. When you're looking at India, we had projected based on 2016's performance of tenders, there was an absence of tenders from September all the way to April, and very limited import volume. That then pushed excess inventory into the market in the beginning of 2017. What we believe happened was a significant drawdown of inventory in India. And you're seeing that represented today from September through December, a tender a month or a more and additional consumption of probably 1.5 million tons to 2 million tons just in India. So, we think that that inventory, and it's represented by the statistics, is low in India, and they will continue to tender probably even into January, positive for the market.","Brazil is up about a 1 million tons to-date. Difficulty to store urea in Brazil over time. Imports started early in March and April, and it's continued forward to exceed 4 million tons for this year. So, we're positive on Brazil but don't see them carrying a lot of inventory past February.","And then looking at our market, we believe coming out of second quarter in June entering in July, inventory for all products was very low and, hence, we had a positive pull for our UAN fill program that we thought appropriate pricing level around $125 FOB NOLA.","And so, we're shipping against that, but we've had an incredible amount of exports, and probably limited production as reported by some of the publications in some of the newer plants that were supposed to come online. So, I would expect that inventory is at an average to below average level for UAN and urea.","For ammonia, that mostly stays with the producers, and our inventory is adequate and we're prepared for a robust fall, should that happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. Coal prices have gone up in China even before the winter. So, what's your outlook there? And then secondly on China, China has shut down significant amount of anthracite capacity. If urea prices stay about $250, let's say, how much of that capacity in China do you think can start back up?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, P.J., relative to Chinese coal, we're pretty constructive on where that's headed. One of the folks that we've added to our board recently is John Eaves, who's the Chairman \u2013 our CEO of Arch Coal. They obviously watch that very, very carefully. We coordinate a bit of intel with them, and we remain very constructive on Chinese coal prices going forward.","I think the other issue is, I don't think anymore it's just purely a matter of what the energy cost is in China. We really do believe that the current administration is very focused on environmental reform, and there are a set of those plants that just don't meet emissions requirements that won't come back regardless of where urea prices hit on the international front. Or, Dennis, yes?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think looking at the coal cost on a structural basis for competitiveness, you're seeing probably a $20 to $30 cost increase directly reflected in urea. That combined with low-production capacity utilization, 59, 60, 61, whatever the publications or our industry has put out, puts production around 60 million metric tons to 61 million metric tons. Exports, we project, are 4 million metric tons to 5 million metric tons; leaves a domestic market of around 56 million metric tons.","And we believe, there are also \u2013 just like India, there was significant destocking that took place in the spring. And today in several areas of China, the interior price is greater than the exportable price. And so, I think $250 is a little low. I would say prices need to go probably over $300 for them to be bringing back any production. And I agree with Tony that that production that's environmentally challenged, I don't know the prices what brings it back to the market.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think the other thing I would add is that from an exchange rate perspective, as we modeled into our cost curve that you see in the slides, we are sort of there about RMB 6.80 per dollar. If you go back to sort of this time last year, people were predicting to be well above RMB 7. And so not only coal prices moved in the right direction, the environmental stuff that Bert talks about, but in addition to that, the exchange rate helped as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. On the export program, a couple of things. One, how fully baked are you in terms of the various regions or partners that you'd like to trade with? Are there more relationships you're still looking to build, or do you think you are where you're going to be? And then secondly, is there going to be, going forward, a base level of volume, that you're going to need to export regardless of the comparable netback, whether it's in the U.S. or in the export market just to sort of maintain those export relationships, or how nimble can you be?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think we're going to be incredibly nimble. Based on the product mix that's available to the company and the spreads between ammonia, urea, UAN, nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, DEF, UL, I think those optionality, as well as domestic options and inventory, when you take the whole matrix and look at what is available for us to move, do, and work with, I don't think we have to do anything.","And, yes, we are always building relationships both domestically and internationally. And our customers \u2013 I think our total number of customers has doubled over the last five years, and that's on purpose. We've added sales staff. We've added regions. We've as well as added international staff that we're actively participating in leveraging those relationships for the long-term. We've worked with several traders, as well as destination markets in Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and actively want to grow in that area, because we believe in the long-term structural advantages of farming down there.","In the European market, Belgium, France, Spain, Germany, also active for us, and leveraging our UK operations with the people that we have based in Ince. And so when you look at that across the board, we say this all the time, but we participate in a global market, and anytime if there is an arbitrage or an advantage, we want to participate and know about it. And so we don't have a specific tonnage or allocation per market, it's all driven by netback and optionality.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But, Vincent, to that point \u2013 I mean back to Bert's point on netback and optionality. I mean, I think it's pretty easy for us to get north of $5 million product tons a year if the opportunity were better for us to export than it was to keep those tons home. I think year in and year out, it's probably going to be closer to 0.5 million tons per quarter.","But I want to be clear, we're not going to just export in order to make room for other people. I think people import product into this marketplace at their own peril, because we're going to run our assets very hard. And you get on the wrong side of one of those trades, then you could end up losing a lot of money. So, we'd prefer our tons stay in here, and people need to be cognizant of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Wong of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for having me on the call. So, I'm just wondering, could you help clarify or maybe just provide some more details on the fourth quarter guidance? Because, I mean, I think being above last year's EBITDA is pretty understandable with the new volumes and higher prices and maybe some of the lower cost. But could you help maybe on the magnitude or help quantify how much higher you see that? And then just on the cost curve, how do you see that evolving out to like 2019 if assuming input prices don't really change? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, Andrew, I'll tell you, we're just kind of dipping our toe in the water relative to providing some thoughts around expectations. We don't go out more than sort of one quarter, because, as was evidenced in our second quarter call with respect to what we were thinking, third quarter might end up being, we didn't see the magnitude of the pricing change, and that has a material impact on what ends up our results being.","So, I think we've said about all we want to say in terms of directionally where we expect to be. As you get out to 2019, 2020, 2021, there's an awful lot of things that start influencing what the shape of that curve looks like and the absolute magnitude of it. One of the main ones as Dennis indicated earlier is exchange rate, coal price, gas price in Europe and so forth.","So we try to give our best view of expectation for 2018. But again, there's enough variables involved, particularly as you think about the possibility for tax reform in the U.S., and how that might affect strengthening or weakening U.S. dollars, how interest is treated in terms of deductibility or not, economic expansion.","All those things drive exchange rates, and that's a big input to that cost curve. So, we haven't published anything that goes out to 2021. But I would say we feel very good about North American natural gas costs, and we believe we're going to continue to operate deep in the low part of the cost curve, and we feel really good about where we sit.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. I appreciate all of that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to touch a little bit more on the cost side here. If you could just give us a flavor for any updates on natural gas hedges in 2018, that'd be helpful. Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","On gas, we are hedged, as we exited Q3, as we've given previous guidance, we were 10% hedged for 2018. And we have our industrial contracts that are tied are gas based for additional 20%. So 30% roughly of our production is covered. And we have not added any additional hedges for Q4 or 2018 or forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Ben Isaacson of Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","It's Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. Over the past couple of years, we've seen your AN and other prices performing pretty well relative to urea and UAN. How much of an impact of changes such as GrowHow and sales mix into products like DEF had, or is this mainly due to AN being a lot less elastic than UAN and urea? Do you see other drivers of the move?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I would say a couple of things and then Bert jump in, one of which is it's been a tremendous benefit for us to be the 100% owner of the former GrowHow business, the UK, CF Fertilisers UK. So we've brought a lot of discipline both from an operational perspective and a marketing perspective to that business.","And then separately, at the beginning of 2017 was when the kind of long-term supply agreement with Orica, Nelson Brothers kicked in, and that contained in it some pricing provisions that were more attractive than historical. So, it's the combination of those two things that have really made the AN business improve pretty substantially for us relative to what it would have looked like a couple years ago, and we feel very good about that segment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alexandre Falcao of HSBC. Your line is open.","Alexandre Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you. I have two questions. One is, you've been painting a very positive scenario for 2018. My question is, if anything goes wrong, where do you think we're going to see the biggest probability of going wrong?","And second on, specifically on Brazil, seems to be a very strong market, and you guys are still not fully penetrating there. Is it just a ramp-up phase? Is there anything in particular, could expect more of that market from you guys going forward? Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, what could go wrong, actually, I'd say, what already went wrong in leading from 2015 into 2016, 2016 into 2017, were a strong dollar, low-priced, low-valued soft commodity markets, corn, sugar, wheat, cotton; low vessel freights; and a flattening energy curve; and low-priced energy in Europe and most places in the world; cheap coal. What's changed? All of those. So, as we go into the end of this year, freights are up. You could ship from China to the United States for less than $10, today it's probably over $20, maybe $25.","We still have a flat energy curve, but looking positive with coal pricing increases in Australia, China, and I think a positive market there. A weakening dollar with the euro at one point approaching $1.19 and RMB also stronger, ruble stronger, those are good. Brazil a little weaker which is good for agricultural production down there.","And so what could go wrong is, we've talked about, and that's why we believe it's still a transition year with additional capacity in North America coming up. Capacity was offline or in maintenance coming up, and demand patterns going forward. So, I think we're in a year. But as we talk about growth, as market grows both industrially and agriculturally, growth eventually catches up and surpasses, because there's not a lot of new capacity coming on post-2018, and that's when we believe the market becomes more of a demand-driven market than a supply-driven market.","Relative to your question on Brazil, Brazil is a great market, where you have a lot of good friends down there, meet with them regularly. As a matter of fact, one of our staff is there today. And we integrate and are active in understanding the demand patterns and price points.","The reasons why we're active in Brazil are two reasons. It's one of the lowest priced markets in the world. And today, it's recovered. It's a $300, let's say, plus or minus metric ton, but as you work back to freight, that hasn't been that attractive for urea and it's a predominantly a urea and a sulfate market. We are trying to grow the UAN market and are consistently shipping products in there. So, I don't see us ramping up necessarily to a market to be a participant unless it makes economic sense. And so when that changes or when that becomes attractive, you'll see us actively participate in a greater degree.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other comment I would make about 2018 is that, I don't know that we've necessarily tried to paint an overly rosy picture about it. We've pretty much consistently said our view of 2018 is going to be a lot like 2017. There's going to be pricing volatility. There's going to be ups and downs as the new capacity that comes online that's absorbed into the marketplace. And that leads directly to what could go wrong, so you get a couple of traders, importers that think they're smarter than everyone else. They bring too much product in here. Prices crash, because they don't appreciate how much real capacity there is in North America, that could certainly affect it. So, until those kind of trade flows work their way through the system, there's going to be some uncertainty and volatility out there, and we're not counting on 2018 being much different than 2017.","Alexandre Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sandy Klugman of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Does the company have any SWOTs on China, potentially moving its gasoline market to an E10 blend. By my estimates, it could translate to up to 2 billion bushels of incremental corn demand which would obviously be very positive for CF?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sandy, we agree that that would be incredibly positive for CF. And we are following that through our ethanol friends. There are exports taking place as you've seen over the last couple of years when sugar prices were high in Brazil and more sugar was committed to that rather than ethanol in Brazil, we were exporting down there, and I like how we're trying to build markets. Ethanol is a great oxygenate and a good product for some of these markets that are trying to make the transition, either away from ethanol or doing different things with their supply mix on gasoline. So our take is yes, that is positive. But it's a long way to go, whether it's a domestically produced product which again pulls more domestic-produced corn or imports, I think we're a couple of years away from seeing that take place. It's probably E1 right now. And so, more to come.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. When you say you expect continued price volatility, do you think similar lows and similar highs to 2017? And I ask that primarily on the low side, because once you go below the cost curve, it's really hard to tell how low, low is?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think, John, obviously we don't have a crystal ball in this regard. I think the lows kind of get tested when you have excess material floating around, because you're in the shoulder periods between applications and you've got big slugs of new capacity that comes online, and then people have these lost positions that they're trying to unwind and get away from, and it really just drives pricing well.","But as you saw this year, prices can't sustain those levels for very long. People shut down as that material gets absorbed, it's a pretty quick response, back to more in the $300 per met, which is kind of the global price point right now based on the attenders and what's being sold out of North Africa. So, we do think volatility will be there whether it overshoots as much as it happened on the downside this coming season. I think a lot of that is going to depend upon whether importers and traders find some discipline.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions for today.

We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin Jarosick","Good morning and thanks for joining the CF Industries 2018 full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President; Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its full year and fourth quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","Anthony Will","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for 2018, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, a 45% over 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $969 million. These results reflect a backdrop of tighter global nitrogen supply demand and generally lower North American natural gas prices. But it was the hard work and outstanding execution by the CF team that allowed us to capitalize on the market conditions.","And even though it was the efforts of the entire CF team that delivered these great results, I want to highlight Chris\u2019 and Bert\u2019s organization in particular. Let me call your attention to slide 7 of our materials. This data taken from an analysis conducted by CRU indicates our superior operating performance.","We've talked about being great operators in the past, but this may be the first time we've quantified the impact for you. We've been able to achieve a 10% greater utilization in our ammonia plant production than our North American competitors. Based on the size of our network, that translates into roughly 800,000 tons of incremental ammonia per year that we produce versus what our competitors would be able to do with a comparably sized asset base.","Or said another way, we basically have a full additional world scale ammonia plant worth of production every year based on our operational capabilities. Given that a world scale ammonia plant in North America would cost over $1 billion, our operational expertise is a significant competitive advantage.","On the supply side and -- on the supply chain and marketing side, we realized higher selling prices across all products year-over-year. We also achieved lower costs of goods sold for the year. This execution across all parts of our business enabled us to generate an increase in adjusted EBITDA of 45% versus 2017.","We operated well and most importantly, we did so safely. We ended the year with a recordable incident rate of zero point six incidents per 200,000 hours worked, and we accomplished that despite a very heavy turnaround in maintenance schedule.","I am really proud of the CF team for a truly fantastic year. Looking ahead, we're excited about 2019. As Bert will explain in a moment, we see a continuation of the favorable market conditions from last year. Based on January and February, actual gas costs along with the forward strip 2019 gas could be lower than 2018 by almost 50 million.","Additionally, year-to-date index pricing at the U.S. Golf for major products as reported in the publications is also running ahead of last year, and we anticipate a substantial increase in nitrogen demand in North America given our expectations for increases in both corn and wheat acres compared to last year.","All of that suggests a strong first half of 2019. Weather will have a big say as to if that materializes in the first quarter or the second quarter. But either way the first half in total should be strong. The second half of the year is always a reset, and therefore somewhat uncertain as we sit here in February. But, we continue to be bullish about the long term trends that extend out to 2022 and beyond.","New global nitrogen capacity is growing more slowly than demand, further tightening supply and demand. And the forward curve from North American natural gas looks really attractive compared to the rest of the world. So our story is more than just about a great opportunity in the first half of 2019. We are very well positioned for the next four to five years.","In 2018, our business generated $1.5 billion in cash. We deployed that cash consistent with our longstanding capital allocation philosophy. We invested in sustaining and improving our existing assets. We grew by acquiring the previously outstanding units of Terra Nitrogen LP.","We paid our regular dividend and we returned our excess cash to shareholders by announcing and then completing a $500 million share repurchase program. As shown on Slide 9 of our materials, the share repurchases by themselves should drive a roughly 5% accretion in 2019 over 2018.","We closed the year with almost $700 million in cash on the balance sheet and given our positive outlook for the next four to five years, our board has authorized a new $1 billion dollar share repurchase program that runs through 2021.","In addition, we again reiterate our commitment to retire the $500 million in debt honored before its maturity in May of 2020.","With that, let me turn it over to Bert, who will cover our market outlook and then Dennis will discuss our financials before I return for some closing thoughts. Bert?","Bert Frost","Thanks Tony. The CF team performed well throughout 2018 with total sales of 19.3 million product tons. This included a record volume of urea and near record volume for UAN. Ammonia sales while benefiting from higher prices were notably lower in 2018 compared to 2017. This was due both to a higher number of plant turnarounds in 2017 and a fall ammonia season negatively affected by poor weather.","Global prices reached 2018 highs in October. Since then, they have been under pressure; first due to moderating energy prices in Asia and Europe, and then due to seasonally low demand in the northern hemisphere. We believe that as demand begins to materialize, industry fundamentals will support global nitrogen prices in 2019.","As a result, we see substantial opportunities to build on our 2018 performance. Net global urea production capacity additions are projected to be modest for the year at approximately 3.5 million metric tons. Additionally, we believe global nitrogen demand will be solid in 2019.","Most notably, we expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the first half of the year. The new crop soybean to corn futures ratio favors a substantial increase in corn plantings in the United States, which are projected to rise by 4 million acres to 93 million acres in 2019. We also expect a 1 million acre increase in wheat plantings.","These acreage shifts should drive incremental nitrogen demand in North America. Additionally, the poor fall ammonia season supports further incremental demand, areas that did not apply ammonia in the fall will likely need to make up the resulting nitrogen deficit in the first half of the year with applications of ammonia or upgraded products in the spring.","With the demand outlook in North America, we anticipate barge, rail and truck logistics assets will be in high demand and price at a premium through the second quarter. As we look ahead, we expect sales volumes to increase compared to 2018. In any given year, CSL is around 19.5 million product tons, which can be higher or lower based on turnarounds and maintenance inventory levels during the year and product mix.","We also expect it to continue to benefit from our access to low cost North American natural gas. We weathered spikes in the fourth quarter well, and the forward curve looks favorable. We continue to benefit substantially from basis differentials particularly in Oklahoma and Alberta and are actively managing our natural gas requirements purchasing forward the lock in basis differentials to remove near term price spike risk.","Each of these factors make us optimistic about 2019. We're well positioned for this environment. We have demonstrated our ability to effectively leverage the flexibility of the CS [ph] system to navigate market conditions and we're confident our ability to maximize our overall margin through the year and into the future.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks Bert. The company reported net earnings of $49 million or $0.21 per diluted share and EBITDA of $349 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA was $341 million. As the global nitrogen recovery has taken hold, our cash generation has increased in turn. This has allowed us to play excess cash in line with our longstanding capital allocation philosophy.","As you can see on Slide 6, net cash provided by operating activities is approximately $1.5 billion dollars in 2018. We use $422 million for capital expenditures on sustaining and improvement projects. We also invested in growth by purchasing all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen in April.","It also enabled us to return $780 million to shareholders in 2018, which included $280 million in dividend payments and $500 million in share repurchases. The repurchase program reduced our share count by approximately 11 million shares.","As you can see on Slide 9, taken together, these have increased shareholder participation in the underlying assets of the business by approximately 5% or 2 tons of nitrogen for 1000 shares compared to the end of 2017.","As we look ahead, we believe, we will be able to build on this track record. We ended 2018 with Apple liquidity. Our cash and cash equivalents were about $682 million and our $750 million dollar revolving credit facility was undrawn. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be $400 million to $450 million dollars. And as Tony explained, we also expect substantial cash generation in the years ahead.","As a result, the board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization to the end of 2021. We also remain committed to repaying $500 million in debt on or before its maturity date in May of 2020.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks.","Anthony Will","Thanks Dennis. Before we open the call to questions, I want to again thank all of CF\u2019s employees for their outstanding work in 2018. Their commitment and dedication drives everything we achieve as a company. We're proud of what we accomplished in 2018 and we're looking forward to the opportunities we see ahead in 2019 and beyond. We're well-positioned to leverage our considerable strengths and take advantage of the favorable industry fundamentals we see for the foreseeable future. We expect us to drive our substantial cash generation capability and we can enable us to continue to create long term shareholder value.","With that operator, we will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi good morning. I just wanted to find out a little bit about your thoughts on the Magellan pipeline, potentially being shut down and what that means longer term for both your business as well as the future for ammonia?","Anthony Will","Yes, thanks. Regarding the Magellan, we are disappointed, but not surprised by their decision to shut down the pipeline. They've had operational issues for the past several years which has challenged them to support or shift the tons of wheat we've wanted to move up in the upper Midwest.","We ship about 4% to 5% of our ammonia on the Magellan and kind of projecting what we thought would happen. We've been working with our system, with our team to create options and different avenues to move our tons up into that market. One is barge loading out of vertebrates which we're able to do now, as well as increasing our storage capabilities in certain terminals and working with our truck providers.","So we believe that we will be in an okay position moving forward to continue to move those tonnes into the market and we expect that the pipeline to shut down by the end of the year.","Realistically Michael, it was just the [Indiscernible] tonne, so with the predominant tons that that we transported down to the gallon as Bert said, we've got a good barge options coming out of there. So I think Bert's team has done a really nice job of preparing for this eventuality.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotia bank. Please proceed.","Ben Isaacson","Good morning. Thank you. When you think five plus years out, can you give us an update on how you see the growth of the U.S. LNG market impacting U.S. nitrogen economics and specifically CS position on the cost curve and do you have kind of strategies to manage that? Thanks.","Anthony Will","Yes. Ben, I think both Dennis and I will take a look at this. But, the good news is from our perspective that construction costs in North America are extremely high. And so anybody that\u2019s building an LNG liquefaction capacity in North America is putting a fair bit of dollars into the ground and are expecting a return on it given that those are all for profit entities over here.","And the result of that is given an expected rate of return. We see gas costs in the rest of the world continuing to be in a position where North America is substantially advantaged relative to our competitors abroad. And I think from a resource base in North America if you look at what's happened just in the last couple of years we've gone from high 60s low 70s Bcf production into the 80s or mid 80s now. And the supply response is very quick in North America and gas price is below three bucks.","So, we don't think there is an issue of the resource drying up quickly and North American gas spiking and we don't see the new LNG capacity dramatically lowering the marginal cost of production elsewhere in the world. So for the next four to five years, we think it's business as usual for U.S. producers.","Dennis Kelleher","Yes. Ben I think the key thing for you to look at on the resource side is what is sort of the resources to production ratio, and I've seen that anywhere from 80 to 100. And when you've got a ratio that high, typically when you've got money, you can tap into the resource with short cycle time, low cost, land rig projects, the production response can be as Tony has talked about or outlined it.","And so, the small increments that we see in LNG capacity that have come or that will come are pretty small compared to what the resource base is capable of producing in a fairly short timeframe.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. Given we're approaching the challenge of capacity expansions over the last build cycle was half decade or so. How do you believe urea trade flows are going to evolve given the decreasing importance of Chinese exports? And if you could also touch on how you believe the UAN trade flows will evolve in the context of European anti-dumping duties, both of those would be appreciated? Thank you.","Bert Frost","So you're right. Regarding expansions, we're as I said, in my notes that about 3.5 million tons are coming on this year, a declining amount of tonnage, new tonnage coming on and with the expected growth we expect that the urea market will be good and positive going forward. However, the capacity of expansions that have come are from lower cost production areas, Nigeria, Northern Africa, Middle East. I'm not sure about the Indian additions that there are announced just because there'll be having to pay high cost LNG. And we do believe that China over time is moderating down to this level of about 2 million tonnes of exports.","So trade flows. I think you've seen the additions come on and operate well in the United States. We're going to move down into a lower level of imports and stay in that range of let's say 4 million tonnes, and we expect growth in Brazil as the Petrobras plants are shut down. So moving from 5 million tonnes to over 6 million tonnes, still expect India to be a net six to seven million tonne range for the next couple of years.","And so it's a classic supply and demand and high cost and marginal producer back to those economics and the cost curve will work and that these higher cost, higher LNG markets will have to moderate down and absorb the lower cost tonnes and that's a direct reflection of these EU discussions.","We're actively participating in and cooperating with this analysis. We expect an announcement to come out in the next month or month and a half and they can lead to duties, no duties or continuation of the same duties, which we paid today at 6.5% while millions of tonnes come this way and pay no duty in the United States.","So our position on that one is pretty clear, the low margins of the European producers is completely unrelated to the U.S. imports that we have shipped or exports we have shipped over to there, but it's caused by a combination of what we would experience a lower price UAN and urea global prices and then higher European production costs driven by high gas costs, whether that be LNG or Russian imports.","And so, we expect, and I would if you were thinking economically and reviewing the economic analysis that we and others have provided that that analysis should come out that we did something that was shipping tons at prices similar to what the United States were and was not anything close to dumping.","Anthony Will","Yes, I mean, I think on that point as Bert said, we're cooperating actively with the Commission investigation. We are not dumping, it is a global price point for UAN and our delivered price into France and Belgium is above what our net back price would be using a Jones Act Vessel that hit the East Coast of the United States.","So those are very rational, kind of moves for us to make. And at the end of the day, it is not the Western European producers that are filing this complaint. It is -- it's not Euro Cam [ph] it's not OCI, it's not Yara, it is the Eastern European producers; Lithuania, Romania, Poland, [Indiscernible] that are bringing this. This lawsuit and as Bert said, they're running very inefficient, very high cost, and logistically challenged plants, because if you look at where the center of mass of U.N. consumption is in Europe, it's France and Belgium and where those plants are located in the East, they have as high of transportation costs to land that product as we do, or even higher.","So the fact the matter is, if the European Commission goes forward with some sort of duties, what they're basically telling us the French farmers you have to subsidize the high cost eastern European producers. And if you're sitting in Belgium, that's probably not a terribly attractive message to be sending out to the French farmers particularly given the yellow vest situation and so forth.","So we'll see how it develops. But Bert, you want to talk about plans that we've made to deal with the situation if it goes that way, if the farmers are subsidizing high cost producers.","Bert Frost","Yes, either way, it's regarding your question on trade flows. We're constantly looking at our options and optionality to the system whether that be moving it to this market or that market we're ambivalent to where the tons go. We like to move them to the highest net back.","But, that being said, we've constantly review, we brought on 1.8 million tonnes of capacity in 16 and 17 of UAN, and we've had additional capacity growth because the Port Neal plant, the urea plant is running so far above capacity we have extra liquor, and we\u2019re making extra UAN up there also.","So when you look at the buckets that are available to us, it's the production mix that we choose to work with each. We can move really on a ship, let\u2019s each day to week, and probably right now we're running a little higher urea mix because that is more attractive. We're looking at extra terminating opportunities in the United States and on the coasts, and we're working with our domestic customers for additional tonnage to remain in this market.","And then you've heard us talk about the development of South America, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico all of those markets have grown substantially in the last five years and we're at the forefront of that effort for very attractive margins.","So we look at least CF\u2019s UAN book we think, we'll be able to continue at the same level or above that we're participating in the market today, and see good opportunities going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Joel Jackson","Hi good morning guys. The last few months, we saw a lot of volatility around Indian tenders, which urea tenders, which you don't participate in. But maybe from your perspective, you can comment on what kind of volatility the market has created among -- participants in terms of different trade flows going in between China and India, senior [ph] China and Iran, but also there's a lot of discussion of maybe some of the bid volumes into that tenders were double counting different ways.","So maybe talk about how the different play on the Indian tender has affected your market that you participate in? Thanks","Anthony Will","Yes. When you look at the India tenders, they do, depending on the size and the timing, can have a big impact. They're the only country in the world that purchases this volume, this amount of tonnes, six, minutes let's say five and a half to seven million tonnes depending on the year. And in the past, that came principally from Iran and China.","As we've talked about over the last couple of years, these trade flows are changing. And we see a decreasing amount of tonnage coming out of China, over the next couple of years and that has happened. And then, with the sanction on Iran, that has been difficult if not impossible to participate in the recent Iranian tenders.","So that tonnage has moved to the Middle East principally supplied out of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and some of those countries as well as Nigeria and some northern Africa. And so I think, as traders and producers have participated, some producers are going direct, and some traders, you're right, some people took some shorts and then covered later. And so that does have a disrupting impact on the overall market when you get it in and buy a million plus tonnes in a week, and then that ships over a six to eight week period.","So, we look at that for us and how we manage our position and how we manage what we expect to come into North America. And I think for us, that's a good outcome that Indian buyers are buying, and the Middle East Eastern producers are shipping it's like a $7 freight to go to India rather than spending $20 to $30 to come to North America.","But this goes back to my earlier comment that, this is just how economics works. Low cost providers are providing into a market that's attractive for them, and so trade flows will continue to evolve. We have some spot tonnage that comes into this market as well as Brazil. And when that is too much, that overwhelms the market. That's what happened to Brazil and that's what happened to us in the last couple of months. We think that will moderate, and we see a positive market going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed.","Mark Connelly","Thanks. Just a quick follow up on the pipeline issue. With cold weather affecting the barge season, there's already talk of high barge demand through second quarter. Is that going to drive your freight costs higher?","Anthony Will","For CF, we\u2019ve contracted our barge logistics and as well we have our own railcars were 5000 and we have our own trucking group that\u2019s managing an increasing amount of our truck logistics. You're correct. I think with the cold weather, the ice, and ice lot probably will be a little bit later, but the volume of water that's probably going to be going down the rivers will make barge traffic going up slow.","So, the impact of the Magellan for us is ammonia, and we do barge ammonia for Verdigris as well as Donaldsonville, and we are already putting that. What we believe will happen into motion and I think we\u2019ll be fine. But I do think that barge freights probably will go up and we can see what\u2019s other competitors and customers are doing, locking up lows points like Saint Louis and CF for Midwest or securing large logistics versus the spot vessels that are coming in for its inability to get that, that\u2019s what I think will be impacted, but these vessels are coming without barge service connecting to the sale might suffer an inability to get service for a short period of time.","Anthony Will","The other thing I would add, Mark to what Bert has said is, generally speaking much of the tightness in the barge market is focused around dry product and we have \u2013 we own our own ammonia toes [ph] and have long-term leases on the other ones. So we\u2019ve got pretty ready access to the vessels and have power on long-term lease as well. And because of the bases differential favorability in Oklahoma we can actually move Verdigris ammonia down into New Orleans for about the same price or even some days cheaper than what we can produce it in Donaldsonville, and because Donaldsonville already on the Newstar. What we tend when we do an ammonia export is lot of times end up making that the Verdigris tons that go out.","So, on the glass half full side of the equation high barge costs and freight costs in general just increase the in-market premium that we get. And so given the in-market network and capacity that we have -- that\u2019s actually a really good thing for us as opposed to a bad thing, high oil, high freight costs, high scarcity of a vessel another options all play to our advantage instead of becoming a detriment to us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Good morning. What would say contribute to your UAN net realized price in the quarter that seems more and more below our spot expectations for the quarter? Was it in particular key end markets who were selling into that weight on that or maybe it was forward sales? And then in terms of your outlook for UAN with respect to pricing that has been a little bit weak here in the last two months, what gives you the conviction that the channels not already full -- your outlook for more corn and the fall application season was light, that seems very supportive, but how do that channels not already full or your competitors haven\u2019t already sold forward?","Anthony Will","Steve, let me answer the first piece of that and I\u2019ll turn it over to Bert to handle the forward look. So, I\u2019m going to take you back to our November transcript. I\u2019m not sure how much clear we could have been about saying, look our forward order book, we liked to the price when took it, we didn\u2019t see the huge run-up coming in the fall and expect most of the fourth quarter to contain a heavy dose of fill from the summer. So I understand that a lot of people sort of having \u201cmiss out there on UAN price\u201d but its not clear to me what we could've done differently to have provided visibility in that what people should\u2019ve been expecting.","And my only sense is, and I say this with the most respect for your work like you got to listen what we say instead of what the publications are posting for spot price, because we gave you the script for what was to happen in terms of the fourth quarter results. But that said, I\u2019ll turn it over to Bert and let him talk about our view into the first half of 2019.","Bert Frost","Yes. So, looking at, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s general fall. We\u2019ve spent considerable time on the last several years identifying tanks and size of tanks and the ability of the distribution system to absorb the tonnage that\u2019s produced they imported. Today the UAN market we believe for North America will be above 14 million tons. And I think demand for specifically UAN will be robust given that the fall ammonia season was so light. And when you look at the fall ammonia season comparison, 2018 was a very poor year comparable to 2016 [ph], the difference being that in 2016 we didn\u2019t get a lot in Canada and the Northern tier, but did in the Southern tier. It was the opposite this time.","And we did get a lot of movement and product supplied in Canada to Northern tier and did not in the Southern tier which is a bigger consumption area. That means that kind of the industry taking about 40% went down, so 60% did not and that could be considerably 700,000 to a million tons of ammonia. That will be impossible for that to all go out as ammonia. It will have to go to upgraded product. And so, we believe our customers are preparing for that and realizing that they need to get those logistics in place, those logistics can reserve and that is with us and others.","And so competitors may have sold forward, that\u2019s fine. The market in terms of the being weak on an end base, is actually very strong with urea trading where it is in NOLA at the current UAN price which trading above its historic premium. And we think positioned very well and we\u2019re probably, I\u2019d say, four to six weeks away from spring starting and that\u2019s just plays right into our strengths with our storage network, end market production and we think that UAN pricing will fare fairly well in Q1 and Q2.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed.","Don Carson","Yes. I had question on \u2013 your thoughts on the moderation of Asian and EU energy prices on the global cost curve. Normally in your presentation you\u2019ve got a cost curve and what the implications are for what you think U.S. pricing would be. For example, in Q3 you are implying that \u2013 then cost curve would give you a 260 to 310 NOLA urea price range in 2019, you went through some of the your cost advantages over TTF [Indiscernible] site. So can you update us on where we are now compared to what you\u2019re talking about the third quarter given lower energy prices? Thanks.","Dennis Kelleher","Yes. Don, this is Dennis. When we talk last time we\u2019ve been \u2013 as you said the range was as you laid it out little bit $300. What we\u2019re saying today is basically the floor that we talked about because the shelf fits is roughly the same sort of that\u2013 say, 250, but the ceiling has come down to say sort of 285 to 290 to account for what\u2019s happened to oil prices than to related effects that they\u2019ve on gas prices. So we still face a pretty steep cost curve even with what\u2019s happened in energy prices. And if you look at those two numbers I just gave you, you can see it way at the left-hand side of the cost curve, that there is still as Tony and Bert have been discussing, a tremendous margin opportunity still left in the business.","And we\u2019ll have to see what happens to oil prices. What we\u2019ll see now is that OPEC compliance has been reasonably good. OPEC plus and price from upper I think at $64 Brent today, I\u2019m not sure exactly what the forward curve is going out, but it looks like its perking up just a little bit.","Anthony Will","And I would just add Don, on that one. You\u2019re absolutely right. When we published that curve, I think Brent was at 70 -- mid-70s and now it's low 60s. The one thing that moderated against that a little bit is internal to China, not what they're importing but internal China at least according to the Woodmac [ph], their coal prices have remained relatively flat if not increased a little bit. And so as Dennis said, you may have a couple of those bars on what was otherwise a fairly flat shelf that have changed positions a little bit here and there, but -- and you got compression in terms of the width of that high to low, but its not like the low end to that has collapsed up by any stretch of the imagination.","The other thing that we\u2019re pretty excited about honestly is after we published the curve in October you got into November and December in U.S. gas price, it\u2019s spiked for quite a while. It looked like the forward into the first quarter was up with a four handle on much of that and when you look today it\u2019s come down dramatically. We\u2019re in the mid 2s now. And so there is -- I think it goes to what we spoke about earlier terms of the supply response in the U.S. and just how much capacity there is to gas around here. And if anything our cost structure is favorable to when we produce this chart back in October and we\u2019ll have to see what happens to the rest of the year. But we\u2019re very pleased to be largely open gas right now and -- because I think there is some upside for us out there.","Bert Frost","Yes. Don, the other thing that I\u2019ll point out, but its always important I think to remind people who look at the cost curve what they are facing what they are a good indication. So what average prices would be for sort of the year if the energy prices that we lay out in the detail we\u2019re prevalent? And it really is a price floor not a price ceiling. And so you can get into the periods during the year and you can get in two years in which the demand is a lot stronger than the immediate supply and you can get prices on average that rise above the cost curve as we have seen in prior years.","And one thing that I think that they\u2019re going makes us confident in this perspective, that as you look forward going from the 2019 through 2021, 2022 the rate of growth and capacity is outstripped by the rate of growth and demand, And so despite demand balancings moving in the right direction for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed.","Duffy Fischer","Yes. Good morning. Two questions of the impact of the floor application fall season in North America. First is, if we get the big expected spring like you think does that change the mix of nitrogen products between urea, UAN and ammonia or will the mix be normal. And then two, what is that do to your inventories both dollar amount that you carried through the year? And then how much kind of product you have replaced to meet a big demand season?","Bert Frost","So impact to the floor fall you cannot \u2013 as you enter floor we plan for a normal season and we got decades of to shows what normal is. And some of that presold and some of that is sold fast. As we roll through the fall it was evident early, I\u2019m talking about by the 10th November we would not have a fall ammonia season. And so we quickly pivoted in and redirect the tons to different markets and position the plants differently. Our intension is always to run our plants full and to then prepare for the spring and position those products for demand starting kind of now in the Texas and Oklahoma market and as the market moves north those markets come into play.","So first, Spring, we are playing for a big spring with 93 million acres were constructively positive what can happen in the corn sector, one because of the low stock use ratio on corn. We believe that the $4 position today corn has some upside, beans probably has downsize, but carry out almost 100% increase in the carry out in soybeans, very difficult to store and to move and special if you don\u2019t some revolution as Chinese limitation on imports there, plus you\u2019re going into the Brazilian shipment [ph] season now.","So we\u2019re planning out a lower level of soybeans exports from the 24 billion ton type range going forward. And that I think put pressure on soybeans. So the attractiveness of corn I think it goes to 95 million acres. And then moving this additional demand from the fall to the spring will make it difficult to get all those tons out on a timely basis. The ammonia season moves in a period of days and weeks and that\u2019s where I mentioned earlier trucks and other logistics become paramount.","And so, I do believe the mix is going change, let\u2019s say about 700,000 to a million \u2013 700,000 to a million tons of ammonia did not go down in the fall. If you bucket that three different positions just dividing it by a third, 300,000 tons of ammonia will move to the spring, we\u2019re ready for that. And then get it multiplied by the N factor because UAN is 32%, Urea is 46% and ammonia is 82%. You\u2019re going to see a substantial amount of urea and UAN, being needed in the upper Midwest and inventory wise we plan to go in full and prepared and then the challenge will be resupply. So we\u2019re having our railcar position to move those tons as well as our barging assets and we\u2019re up to the challenge.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. In your fourth quarter results can you talk about how much your volume was limited by short season? And how much it was limited by your own turnarounds? And can you also say something about the level of imports of nitrogen fertilizer you\u2019re expecting to the United States in the first half of 2019?","Anthony Will","Jeff, let me handle kind of the first pieces of that or at least the piece of the first piece of that and then I\u2019ll throw it over to Bert.","Jeff Zekauskas","Sure.","Anthony Will","The turnaround activity while it\u2019s high for us really -- had we had extra ammonia in the fourth quarter that would\u2019ve either had to go out as exports which the ammonia exports are fine. They make some money. But they're certainly not as valuable as the end market ag sales are. And so the volume shortfall on ammonia was really a seasonal issue as opposed to a turnaround issue. And we had a pretty good movement of the upgraded products. And at the end of the day that was a couple hundred dollars tons we\u2019re talking about. ","So it\u2019s relatively small number in the context of 19.5 million tons. But I would largely point that to the volume of ag ammonia that didn't go out versus what a normal season is as opposed anything else. And then Bert, I\u2019ll let you kind of comment on the rest.","Bert Frost","Yes. So, looking at the imports where we are to-date, I would say, we\u2019re ahead expecting 4 million to 4.1 million tons of urea and one probably needed 1.5 million tons of UAN and we\u2019re currently trending towards above that level. So I think you\u2019ve seen the weakness in NOLA. And Jeff, remember New Orleans is one of the few markets in the world that has liquidity at all times. In Brazil you have to bring that vessel in and nominated and it sold. You don\u2019t have to do that in NOLA and then there you walk off tenders.","And so we\u2019ve seen some traders. This is what has happened over the years, the traders bring product in, market gets lower and they take or some of these taking these losses and we believe that\u2019s decline over time as we\u2019re going from 8 million tons in first to four, but takes time for people who learn lesson I think. And so we expect that inputs coming in Q2 would be probably lower just because of total demand in position. And we think the market will balance that like.","Jeff Zekauskas","But I want to just comment a little bit on \u2013 so you do have [Indiscernible] imports kind of swapping around in NOLA but in market premium what\u2019s happen to that given the constraints on being able to actually move that product out of the region?","Anthony Will","Yes. I think a direct reflection of the importance of logistics contracts positioning and timing is where we are on both the market premium for urea and UAN and the ammonia for the matter. Ammonia is trading below $300 in Tampa and at $500 in the end market terminals. Urea is trading in 240 in NOLA and trading at $290 to $300 in the interior, UAN trading at 185\/190 in NOLA, trading it say, 210 to 240 in the interior depending on the production location. So you exactly right. This is something we\u2019ve talked about and we plan on continuing, because there is a value to being able to pick up and not has such a substantial position taking a vessels of 30,000 tons at prices several million dollars where you been taking it by the truck loads and I think that\u2019s called just appropriate positioning risk for our customers who want to provide that opportunity for them.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Anthony Will","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","So, with the lower fall application that goes into spring, farmers can decide to apply little bit of ammonia, but maybe more likely urea and UAN. And how do you think that will play out in terms of volumes of each, because your margins are different on each product. So how do you maximize your profit while helping your growers and related just quickly how much urea did you export during the off season here and what was the net back on the export? Thank you.","Anthony Will","Okay. So, looking at that question and we don\u2019t sell directly to farmer, we work with our retail and channel partners to do the optimal decision-making for the farmer. And that is directly connected to the 4Rs for planting the right product at the right rate, at the right place, at the right time. And so we make these products and we can move our products in different places whether that would be export domestic, up to the river, on the rail, with the trucks, through a pipeline, with the idea of having or the idea of having that product in place for our customers to pull.","And so, when you\u2019re looking though at corn farmer who is planting for yield and their trend yields this year is of 176 bushels an acre. If you\u2019re in the [Indiscernible] space, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and probably Nebraska pivots irrigation areas, your target is probably 220 to 280 bushels an acre and that\u2019s what it was pulled off last year. So, as you\u2019re planting you\u2019re pulling nutrients off the soil and those nutrients will be needed and especially needed for seed, optimal seed growth. What we\u2019re seeing is a combination of that application but ammonia play the pivotal role in the initial growth stage of the corn crop and then either urea or UAN or a combination there of both application.","And so, yes, margins are different for upgraded product as we go, but we\u2019re driven. I think to serve the needs of the farm center and retail center and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. On urea exports, what we [Indiscernible] where our products go and that driven for that market also. So when there is an attractive opportunity we will export and we did that last week. We took a vessel to Chile [ph] where we\u2019re going to be loading in next week and that was positive net back compared towards the domestic market was giving us. Last year we export a little over 400,000 tons of urea, 450,000 and UAN cost to 1.5 million tons focused on Europe and South America, but we shipped to Australia and Ukraine also.","And so those are great opportunities for us. We were happy to build our customer base as a global participant in this market and as those opportunities come to as we will execute against them.","Dennis Kelleher","And in particular on Urea I would say much of the year last year or the U.S. was a little bit of the port of last resort for a number of international producers. And so what you saw was NOLA trading at a bit of a discount international parity. And so on, virtually every one of those exports that we conducted last year that net back was substantially above what NOLA was offering. And so I think from the standpoint urea in particular export is a great option for us.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed.","John Roberts","Thank you. Was the buyback activity in the fourth quarter about the max rate that you can do in an open market program or could you bought back a lot more stock? And just I think it is about the pace of buyback that we might expect?","Anthony Will","So, John, we had an authorization that was capped at 500 million and in mid October we were \u2013 the share price was trading in the mid-50s, and then as you wound toward the end of the year we had dropped to the low 40s. So I think what you saw was a increased activity that was reflective of where the share price was in the fact that taken shares out in the low 40s is also providing about a 3% after-tax yield for us given the dividend on the share.","So, we think that's a great opportunity to take that down. And going forward I think what you'll see is a pace that is going to be reflective of market conditions and cash generation as well as where the share price is and with lower share price expect us to buy more in. So that\u2019s kind of the how we think about the world.","John Roberts","And then on slide 16 in the back on the expected closures in China, about half of the expected closures are assumed rather than actually announced. Could you talk about the assumptions behind that estimate?","Bert Frost","Yes. The assumptions that way into that is looking at where the coal prices are as well as electricity price and the internal pricing versus being able to get kind of import parity. What are the number of plants that are below breakeven from the standpoint of cash flow perspective? And so, we have a sense of that the aggregate loss from a cash perspective on the number of those plans and that's what goes into that that assessment. We can\u2019t tell you which ones do you turn off the lights first, but we see that as likely coming. And we think there's going to be about 5 million tons of closures as we make our way through this year. Lot of those plants may not be producing today. They could be on curtailment or shut down, but because they haven\u2019t been announced these closures they haven\u2019t yet list yet, but it certainly wouldn't surprise me if it doesn't change the net balance from a Chinese production demand standpoint. It's just there going to be moved in permanent closure as opposed to temporarily curtail.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [Indiscernible]. Thanks for taking my question. Question on just from a modeling perspective for 2019, any puts and takes to think about whether there would be the tax rate or really just \u2013 anything that slide from modeling perspective would be helpful? Thank you.","Bert Frost","Yes. I mean, from a tax perspective what we\u2019re looking at is probably a federal tax rate of around 25%, with sort of mid 20s, so there will be 21% statutory rate plus some state and foreign taxes. Remember that there are largest foreign jurisdiction in Canada has a higher tax rate that we have here today. That however is for provision purposes from a cash perspective you'll see in the in the 10-K, we have a substantial amount of net operating loss carry forwards which are laid out there. But in addition to that we have the ability to take bonus depreciation is to deduct 60% of the cost of capital in year and we\u2019ve got a capital budget next year for four to 450.","So I'm sure how good that our earnings from a tax perspective, you all have different perspectives, but we\u2019ve got way to shelter those, so I wouldn't expect in 2019 we\u2019ll be paying a significant amount of federal cash taxes despite that what we have in the provision.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. You mentioned in your press release you\u2019ve been monitoring the Iranian sanctions and the Chinese re-exporting. I was wondering is there a role to you taken more active stands than just monitoring? You do have pretty active market intelligence as far as I know. How we see this playing out? Can its Chinese traders keep exporting with no interference from the U.S. government?","Anthony Will","Well, I think there\u2019s certainly is the option for some of that to continue and then more recently there's been I think some discussions about doing direct business with India and trying to do some currency payments and movements that don\u2019t touch the international wire system. So, that would allow some of that activity to happen. Our view all along has been that the gas is virtually free, the plants are built. They\u2019re going to run those plants and those tons are going to find a way into the international market through some vehicle and it does created a bit of an overhang and some disruption, but our view is that that was just part of the global supply picture and we were counting on them not happening.","I would say that the U.S. government is well aware that those tons are coming out and some of the stuffs are just outside the areas that we can provide or that the government can provide appropriate pressure against. But I do think longer term the as long as the sanctions stay in place whether it's access to technical expertise, access to new parts particularly some of the more exotic materials that need to be fabbed in Europe or other places that are more directly affected. You may see either a reduction in operating rate or slowness for like the Lordegan plant coming up kind of thing. So I think, what's running is going to continue to run, but depending upon how long this goes on, that could drop off a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","AndrewWong","Hey good morning. So this is regarding the $500 million of debt that's due next year. Do you plan to repay that? Or do you plan to roll it over? And maybe just more of a general question on capital allocation, aside from debt repayments and share repurchases, is there anything else that you look at investing into maybe expansions or M&A things?","Dennis Kelleher","Well I mean, if you go back to our capital allocation philosophy. We would like to invest in growth for our business where we can do that and have it be accretive on our cash flow per share basis and above our cost of capital. There are however not a million of those things for us to do, and we're pretty picky about the projects and the M&A prospects that we look at.","So, absent anything of significance in that area, we want to return the cash to shareholders, but we want to do that within a frame -- in a framework that it reflects our commitment to long term investment grade metrics.","And so what we've committed to the market is, we're going to repay on or before its maturity date, which is in May of 2020, the last of the $500 million of the 2010 or 20 I think it\u2019s 2010 bonds. Those are the carrier coupon rate of about 7 and 8.","So, when we finally get that done, we'll be sitting at an interest cost per year cash and just cost of below $200 million per year, so a significant reduction in fixed charges. I think, it's also important as Tony pointed out, that we also do share repurchases as a means of returning cash to shareholders in [Indiscernible] like a 3% ish after tax yield on that, and it does eliminate a lot of fixed charges as well. So we believe that both taking the debt out and also reducing the fixed charge associated with dividends are credit positive.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today. I'd like to turn the call back to Martin Jarosick for closing remarks.","Martin Jarosick","Thanks everyone for joining us. And we look forward to following these conversations at various conferences we\u2019ll be over the next few months."],"4821":["CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  8, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Dan Swenson - Senior Director of Investor Relations & Corporate Communications","W.

My name is Nova, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Sir, please go ahead.","Dan Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Swenson, and with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its first quarter 2014 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of the webcast presentation and from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dan and good morning, everyone. Yesterday we posted our financial results for the first quarter, in which we generated $1.3 billion of EBITDA or $513 million of EBITDA excluding the gain on the sale of our Phosphate business. This is a strong level of performance given the business conditions and unusually volatile natural gas cost environment we faced during the quarter. These strong results were delivered primarily because of 3 factors.","First, our experienced and high-performing team who are widely regarded as the best nitrogen operators in the world. Second, our expansive network of production, logistical and distribution assets, which create opportunities that no other nitrogen company can access. And third, our structural cost advantage based on North American natural gas.","Coming into the year, we were concerned with the relatively high level of ammonia inventory across the system. However, our team executed extremely well and we shipped 577,000 tons of ammonia, a 73% increase over the same period last year. That accomplishment was also enabled by our expansive network of distribution and storage assets which allowed us to carry over ammonia inventory from last fall and continue to operate our ammonia plant at high rates without undue concern about system inventory levels. As a result, we were able to operate our ammonia plants at a system wide average of 98% of stated capacity and had inventory available in the appropriate market regions to provide customers product when the demand came.","This winter was the coldest in North America in 30 years, resulting in record natural gas withdrawals and increased short-term volatility in natural gas prices. Henry Hub prices averaged over $5 per MMBtu during the quarter, with significant basis differentials in several areas that were, at times, well into double-digit dollars per MMBtu, including pricing locations that feed Courtright and Port Neal. However, the hedges put in place by our gas team enabled us to realize an average gas price of just $4.34 per MMBtu during the quarter. These factors, our employees, our extensive asset base and our natural gas cost advantage are an enduring set of competitive advantages that provide us with significant, sustainable cash flows and enabled us to deliver 44% gross margins in our Nitrogen business.","During the quarter, we also made progress on a number of initiatives that helped execute our strategy to increase nitrogen capacity per share, which translates directly into increased cash flow-generation capacity per share, while at the same time we lowered the cost of financing the enterprise.","We repurchased 3.9 million shares in the first 4 months of 2014. Our repurchases, along with high return investments to expand our current nitrogen capacity, have increased nitrogen tons per share by 144% since the beginning of 2010, which is shown on Slide 6 of the deck.","We are further growing our nitrogen production capacity through our expansion projects at Donaldsonville, Louisiana and Port Neal, Iowa. We made good progress on these projects during the quarter, both of which remain on schedule and on budget. I'd refer you to Slide 5 in the deck for a few pictures of progress at the 2 sites.","We've begun construction of urea warehouses and ammonia storage tanks at both locations. We are also nearing completion of civil foundation work for all the operating units at both sites. These projects will increase our nitrogen capacity by 25% when they come online in 2015 and '16 and will leverage our existing asset base to grow our cash generation capacity with very favorable return characteristics, even in difficult market conditions.","We also made significant progress in the quarter to lower the cost of financing the enterprise. We completed a $1.5 billion investment grade long tenor debt issuance. And we completed the sale of the Phosphate business to Mosaic for an estimated $1.1 billion of after-tax proceeds that we have reallocated back into our high-margin core Nitrogen business.","By focusing on operational excellence, investing in high return growth projects and maintaining a low-cost capital structure, we believe we will continue to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Bert to provide a deeper discussion of the nitrogen market conditions and our operations during the quarter. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Thanks, Tony. During the first quarter of 2014, we saw total nitrogen sales volume growth over the first quarter of 2013, thanks to very solid ammonia, ammonium nitrate and other nitrogen sales volume. The increases in sales volumes of these products offset decreases in urea and UAN. As Tony mentioned, our demand planning and logistics teams did a great job anticipating the robust ammonia demand we saw in the Southern Plains and lower Corn Belt regions. The poor application [ph] conditions in the fall of 2013 created some pent-up demand but, more importantly, we had product in position and ready to ship so that we were able to meet demand and realized a very strong 73% year-over-year increase in ammonia volumes.","In addition, we also had good industrial volume, including the delivery of our first ammonia shipment to Mosaic following the close of the phosphate sale. Ammonium nitrate shipments, including AN export sales, contributed to a 5% increase in AN sales volume. Other nitrogen products, particularly Diesel Exhaust Fluid, experienced strong volume growth from industrial demand.","Our first quarter urea production volumes were lower plus a lower inventory position the first quarter of 2014 compared to 2013 contributed to a decline in the first quarter urea sales volume. We realized good prices relative to market conditions and saw our inventory further declined during the quarter.","In the UAN market, customers were hesitant to make purchases in order to avoid inventory risk. Customers communicated that they are mainly purchasing to cover current commitments and will wait to buy until dealers and farmers committed to spring positions. Rather than selling into a weak environment where prices did not reflect the value we saw in our product, we built inventory with the expectation that more attractive sales opportunities would be available in Q2.","Except for ammonium nitrate, product pricing declined in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 2013. The cold and wet fall of Q4 2013 contributed to a weak ammonia application season and resulted in a higher-than-average industry inventory carried over into 2014. Prices in Q1 were pressured by high ammonia inventory coming into the year but improved throughout the quarter. Granular urea prices declined year-over-year due to higher global supply, while UAN prices were weighed on by buyer reluctance to take on inventory risk.","As we look at the first half of 2014, we expect to see very strong shipments across our nitrogen product portfolio. We forecast at least 92 million acres of corn to be planted and with favorable farm-level economics, nitrogen demand continues to be robust.","We've now seen warm weather make its way to the upper Midwest and we are delivering significant volumes of product to our customers. We have been setting ammonia delivery records at several of our terminal locations such as in Blair, Nebraska, where we safely loaded 235 trucks in a 24-hour period compared to the prior record of 177 trucks. This new record was enabled by a modest-sized but high-return investments we made to increase our load-out capabilities at the terminal.","Robust ammonia demand is also being seen across our Corn Belt distribution points and is resulting in ammonia inventory quickly being pulled down. We believe this inventory drawdown is industry-wide and our estimates show producer ammonia inventory to be very low.","Urea demand has been healthy. And with the lower North American imports received compared to last year, we're seeing a resulting tight inventory position that is supporting spot market pricing.","Given the tight inventory position in ammonia and urea, we expect farmers will increasingly seek UAN to fill their nitrogen needs. Additionally, recent wet weather patterns have curtailed pre-plant ammonia application in some areas of the Corn Belt. Farmers are now getting back into their fields and should be focused on getting corn seed into the ground and following up with UAN side-dress applications.","Given buyer reluctance to take inventory positions, UAN imports are also down from recent years. This is turning out to be a very spot-focused UAN market, which we expect to drive positive sales volume. Our inventory has been positioned in anticipation of that demand.","As we look beyond the spring application season, we expect North American nitrogen prices, as represented at the U.S. Gulf, to decline to global parity. These prices are being impacted by current Chinese urea exports, which are expected to increase during their low export tariff season. This market view is consistent with Chinese new tariff policy and the recent declines in Chinese coal prices. When the Chinese low tariff export season opens in July, we could see urea full prices similar to what we saw last year in the U.S. Gulf. However, we expect the market to balance due production outages at marginal cost producers when prices decline below their cash costs.","Producers in areas with higher gas cost such as Eastern Europe, some producers in Ukraine, have already announced production shutdown as prices have dipped below their cash breakeven points or due to civil unrest.","In context, it is important to note that with gas prices in the mid-$4 per MMBtu range, U.S.-based nitrogen producers can realize very positive cash margins at these perceived floor levels. This positions CF Industries to generate strong cash flows even during periods of weaker market conditions.","Now let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Bert. Our financial results for the quarter demonstrate the robust cash generation capacity of our business. During a quarter characterized by very difficult market and natural gas price conditions, we generated $1.3 billion of EBITDA or $513 million excluding the gain from the sale of the Phosphate business.","Our Nitrogen business had strong results, generating $434 million of gross margin, which was 44% of the $988 million of segment sales.","In addition to addressing and overcoming logistical and nitrogen market challenges, we were also able to mitigate a substantial amount of the volatility seen in the natural gas market as a result of the record cold weather experienced during the first quarter. Late in 2013, we put in place NYMEX hedges for 75% of our natural gas needs for the first quarter at very attractive prices. Even though we experienced some temporary spikes in the basis differentials at a couple of our plants, the hedges reduced our exposure to short-term volatility in the natural gas market. As a result, we had an average realized oil and gas purchase price of $4.34 per MMBtu compared to the Henry Hub average of $5.05 for the quarter.","We're also quite pleased with the progress we've made during the quarter on a number of long-term strategic financial objectives. Progress on our capacity expansion programs continued with $278 million in cash capital expenditures during the quarter. We expect spending on the program to ramp up during the remainder of the year as we begin to take delivery of more of the major equipment and as we continue mechanical system construction work throughout the year. Including the amounts paid this quarter, we still project that we will have roughly $2 billion of capital expenditures related to the expansion program during 2014.","Together with maintenance and other capital expenditures, we expect total CapEx for the year in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion.","During the quarter, we bought back 3.2 million shares, returning $794 million of cash to shareholders through our repurchase program. Through April 30, we purchased an additional 677,000 shares. Cumulatively, the repurchases we have completed since 2011 have had the effect of reducing our share count by over 25% since we completed the Terra acquisition.","During the first quarter, we issued an additional $1.5 billion of long-term investment-grade debt. This consists of bonds with 20- and 30-year maturities and coupon rates of 5.15% and 5.375%, respectively. The addition of this tax-efficient, long-duration financing creates a debt funding profile that is nicely laddered over many years and has provided us with very attractive low-cost financing.","We also are pleased to complete the sale of the Phosphate business to Mosaic and expect to realize approximately $1.1 billion of after-tax proceeds from the transaction. We have set aside $460 million of these proceeds to reinvest in the expansion projects, some of which will be reinvested in a tax-efficient manner that will increase the net present value of the projects. We are also pleased to have Mosaic as an ammonia customer now and have begun shipments to them from our operations in Trinidad.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dennis. The first quarter saw outstanding ammonia shipments. As we move into the second quarter, we are well-positioned to provide the products our customers need. Our team continues to focus on operational excellence and executing our business plan every day. And this is why we are able to generate significant cash flows even during difficult market conditions.","I would personally like to recognize our natural gas procurement team for their work to minimize our exposure to short-term volatility in natural gas prices, which helped us to generate great results for our shareholders this quarter. I would also like to highlight our tax team, who were able to structure the Phosphate sale, and subsequent reinvestment, back into the capacity expansion projects in such an efficient way as to increase the NPV of these projects significantly.","With that, we will now open the line to your questions. Nova?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Yes, Tony, 2 questions, 1 operational, 1 financial. On the operational side, I noted that you said your ammonia units ran at about 98% operating rate in the first quarter. Just wondering if you can compare your operating rates versus the industry and how much additional volume you think that gets you. And then in the financial side, I didn't hear any comments on the status of your MLP review.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Don. I'll tell you what the operation side and then I'll turn it over to Dennis on the MLP side. On the operation side, understand that if you just lose 1 day per month of operating because of maintenance outage or something like that unexpected, it drops your operating rate down to about 97% of capacity. So the fact that we were able to run the system at 98% is pretty darn good, particularly given the high level of ammonia inventory we had coming into the system. I don't really have good data on what other people were doing in terms of the operations during the quarter. But I think the 1 thing that I would highlight is, because of the network that we have and our ability to move ammonia into storage when we need to, it doesn't put a constraint on our ability to run our plants full out all the time. Dennis, you want to handle the MLPs?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Sure. Don, as we said before, we've engaged 2 bulge bracket banks to look at this, the MLP question, for us in a comprehensive way. The last time we talked about this, what we said was, as we look across our system and we look at the older assets, the stuff that's not under construction but low tax bases, we believe it doesn't make a lot of sense to be selling those into MLPs because the tax hit associated with that would make that quite unattractive. And then obviously, we're continuing to look at the newer assets as well. The newer assets will not complete until sometime in 2015 and 2016. So at that point in time, you have to look at the tax code and what that provides for, whether that makes sense or not. But we will have something more definitive to say about the conclusions around the study at some point later this year. I don't have anything to add to that specifically today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Given the magnitude of the buyback in the first quarter and current balance sheet metrics, can you give a little more color on your thoughts on the program, particularly as it appears there are some ample industry headwinds on the horizon?","W. Anthony Will","Sure. Thanks for the question. I'd say a lot of this question has to do with your view of appropriate time frame. And as we look at the business, it's not the next 3 or 6 or even 12 months that we're that obsessively focused about. It's the long term. And as we get out 12 to 18 months, we're going to have the capacity expansion upgrade parts of Donaldsonville online. As we get out 18 to 24 months, we'll have all of the capacity online. So that's going to increase our nitrogen production by 25% and have an appropriate corresponding impact on our cash flow generation. And as we sort of sit back and look at the value that we're trading at today, given the context of that capacity coming online in, we are very comfortable with the pace and the rate at which we're buying shares back and we think viewed in the longer-term time horizon, our shareholders that are with us will stand up and roundly applaud the decisions that we're taking today. So while we would like to buy at bottom tick, we're not going to sit on our hands and try to project when that is. We feel very comfortable with the prices that we're sweeping those shares in at.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just a very quick follow-up. In your release, you mentioned UAN volumes decreased due to some buyer deferrals and pricing may have been a little bit pressured by increases in domestic supply. Can you talk about what you've seen over, let's say, the last 4, 6 weeks as planting has really ramped up and any preliminary expectations going forward over the summer?","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. So for UAN, as we mentioned, we saw a difference between how we valued our products and what we thought would happen as spring unfolded to what the market was -- how the market was pricing UAN overall. Yes, there has been increased domestic production but of course bonding decrease in imports, as well as an increase in exports. So the system, we believe, coming into this period, second quarter, was fairly balanced to tight. And we believe that because of the late, moist and cool weather that we received in April, which really slowed down ammonia applications, that's going to push farmers to probably purchase more UAN than we had anticipated. And so, we positioned our product for that, utilizing our distribution assets, as well as customers have been stepping in and buying every day. And we believe that, that will continue through Q2. After that point, there's always a rebalance in this market where there's an inventory build that lasts several months, and we will enter that market at the appropriate time.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two questions, one a near-term question and then a longer-term one. On the near-term, could you talk a little bit about why you think Chinese coal prices went down? And then who are the other people you expect or other regions that you think will wind up shutting in some capacity over the summer? And then on a longer-term basis, Tony, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but if I think about the next couple of years, in my mind, it looks like this. You finish off the $580 million of the repurchase that's left. In the second half of this year, you'll have some insight into where your CapEx budget is and probably feel -- hopefully feel that you're not going to have material overruns that might allow you to feel comfortable allocating that $1 billion of phosphate proceeds towards either a repurchase or to something else. And then as we move into '15 and '16, we look forward to the decision of whether to leverage those new facilities up, which I think are about $700 million of EBITDA, or to put them into an MLP. And then you'll also be considering if we think back to before when -- before the announcement of the new facilities, there was, I think, almost $2 billion of brownfield projects that could have been. So I guess what I'm saying is, is your line of sight on sort of continued buybacks and volume growth beyond just the sort of '15, '16 period that we're all contemplating today?","W. Anthony Will","Vincent, thanks. I'm going to ask Bert to start off with the Chinese coal and the other regions of the world that we may see shutdowns in, which we just have some news on today in fact. Let's, go ahead, Bert.","Bert A. Frost","Regarding Chinese coal prices, they are already very low. You see a lot of integration plays taking place by the coal producers moving into urea production as of just an integration for that raw material stream. But when you factor in -- if the marginal ton, the import ton, whether from Indonesia or other coal-supplying regions of the world into China, the prices where they're at today are, if they're cash positive it would be questionable. Then you have to look at the cost curve for gas, anthracite, different types of coal, locations, freight. And I believe where they are today and where they're projected to go in June or in July at the opening of the low tariff season will be very similar to last year, could go a little bit lower. But at that point, I don't know if they can sustain that production rate and investment needed to stay active in the business. Relative to the next question on who we expect not to operate. As Tony mentioned today, we received information from KEYTRADE late -- I guess late in their day, early in our day, on the shutdowns from the DF Group in Ukraine due to civil unrest, as well as OPZ is not operating. So I expect that to take 150,000 to 200,000 tons of urea off the market, but there are other places that are not. The Egyptians are on per month, right? Per month, yes. There are other areas that are not operating due to gas shortages being -- the typical ones which we mentioned, Pakistan, Bangladesh and then gas reductions to plants, which would be Egypt. You've got some plants coming up from turnaround. But overall, I think that, even some low gas cost regions are moderate and will not have gas to produce, and then we'll see some of the European, Eastern European, Romanians, Bulgarians, probably have difficulty going forward into Q3.","W. Anthony Will","And Vincent, on your second question about sort of the longer wavelength stuff, I'm going to kind of tag team this one a little bit with Dennis. I'll just start off. You're absolutely right. The brunt of $2 billion of spend on the capacity expansion projects this year is going to happen during Q2, Q3 and into Q4. That's one we're going to be mobilizing the legions of contractors on sites to start the mechanical erection above ground and take delivery from a lot of the larger vessels. And so, as we get into the back end of this year, we'll be through the brunt of the spend on those projects and have much better line of sight in terms of how things are trending and when we expect the projects to come online and what the total cost is. So at that point, we'll be in a much better position to sort of gauge our ongoing position in terms of sources and uses. And then I'll ask Dennis to go ahead and just take it from here.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes. Vince, I think the way to look at is if you go back to what we said in New York, back in December, and what we've been saying since we sort of outlined what our -- this really goes to what your question is, and that's really longer-term capital allocation. We sort of outlined our capacity allocation priorities at that point in time. As Tony said, we want to finish the projects, we want to complete the share repurchase program. We've got some ongoing CapEx and dividends as well. And during that period of time, we expect that the business will continue to generate some significant operating cash flow. We've had the sources of liquidity that we talked about, the $1.5 billion bond issued, $1.4 billion net of tax, $1.1 billion sale of phosphate. All of the things we talked about, those things are playing out as we expected. And so, beyond that sits what we believe could be some substantially free cash flow. And we'll have to make a determination at that time. But the framework for thinking about what we do, whether it's capital returns or investments in projects really, if we have projects in our core business that we can invest in that are well above the cost of capital and those are attractive, we'll invest money in those things. If not, then the money obviously is there for the return to shareholders. So none of that has changed. With respect to your question around financing, the additional capacity when it comes online, we said that we want to be at a debt to EBITDA level around 2, 2.5x. We believe today that we're at the -- comfortably at the lower end of that range. We're mindful of the fact that, as you point out, we'll be bringing on significant amounts more EBITDA with the new projects and we'll make a determination at that time. But our view is to stay solid investment-grade. We believe that means 2 to 2.5x EBITDA. And if there is significant borrowing capacity that could be accessed at that time, at attractive rates and such, then we would certainly look to do that.","Operator","The next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe a question for Bert and reflect on the outlook and the market view today relative to the beginning of the year, clearly some really strong performance in ammonia in the quarter and getting the inventory situation cleared out, and that was a big concern going into the year, maybe balance that by prospects of some more Chinese urea exports. Maybe can you talk about how your view of the year, at least the first half, if not the year, looks today versus it did a few months ago?","Bert A. Frost","Thanks. Good morning. It is different. Coming into the year, we did have a high inventory level of ammonia as well as the rest of the industry and we were concerned because Q4 did not operate as well as we had hoped and I suspect the industry probably less several hundred if not 400,000 tons of ammonia unapplied. So that was in tanks or at plants and we worked since December, you saw us export a few cargoes and then worked to mitigate that risk by moving product to our distribution facilities, selling product in NOLA to some of the importers, moving product spot up through some of the tanks on the River, as well as our industrial business. So a multipronged attack, I guess, on ammonia, which served us well through the quarter and allowed us, I think, to enter into Q2 favorably positioned but still positioned to get the positive momentum from the I states. So in Q1, that was mostly in Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma movement to the ground for wheat as well as corn pre-plant. And then now you're seeing that movement, you're seeing in Q2, a greater drawdown, I think, through the pipeline into the river terminals for corn. Still to go is the Northern tier, which is Canada, North Dakota and Minnesota. So we're watching that. Hopefully, that's going to dry out soon. So that's how we progressed through January. January saw an increase as we went through the months on urea, probably started around 330, peaked around 430 and we're settling back now. I think we're a little surprised at how positive urea movement was through Q1 and into Q2, and that is a reflection, I think, of probably fewer imports and then early pull on urea. And then UAN has been fairly stable through the quarter, it probably started in the lows of $250 and approached almost $300 NOLA. And so, we do think, as I said in our prepared remarks, that UAN will be the positive player in Q2. We should see an overall drawdown of all products. So I think coming from where we were in January to where we think we could end up for the first half, it's a pretty good position for CF as well as the industry. Chinese exports were probably the surprise. I don't think anybody anticipated that you see 2 million tons of exports out of there in January and February. You had an India tender, but that product seemed to go everywhere. And I think you would probably err on the high side of expectation of exports out of China through 2014 and we're preparing for that eventuality. Other than that, I would say we're very positive. I think even with the -- if you were to list the difficulties that we can look back on, logistical constraints, excess product available in the world market, cool, wet temperatures in the United States, and the view where we are today is a pretty remarkable position. And I do credit the team, the guys had planned well and executed well, and I think we're well-positioned to enter the back half of the year. I think prices will go down a little bit, probably -- last year we reached a low of $275, we could dip below that, but I don't think we can sustain that for very long. And you're going to see people falling off. So I don't want to be too optimistic, but I am optimistic the back half.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, in urea in the quarter, your utilization was around 80%, it's a little bit lower than you've seen the last couple of years. Anything notable on the plant side that your utilization was down?","Bert A. Frost","I'd say we did have some downtime in Donaldsonville, during the quarter. We did favor UAN over urea during the quarter. And so, you don't see us make those moves, but we do throttle up and throttle down as we see -- deem necessary or market-driven. And as I said in my comments, we drew our inventory lower through the quarter and so that's where we are.","W. Anthony Will","Adam, I'd also say, that's one of the benefits that our network has, which is, if we do have a urea plant take some unexpected downtime, we're able to reallocate and move that product, barge and pipe into the -- through our terminal system, and that helps us drive our ammonia business. We had conducive weather for it. So we've got a lot of levers to be able to pull kind of regardless of what happens out there and I think this is just another example of just how we can utilize our broad asset base to take advantage of what otherwise might have been challenging for other participants.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A question for you on natural gas. In your press release, you observed that the long-term curve is below $5 through 2020 and you may have also seen 1 of your peer companies in nitrogen elected to layer in some hedges or disclose that they did so yesterday for 2016 through 2018. I guess my question would be, if you can provide us with an update on your philosophy, I think you would need to board approval to go out that far. I don't know if there's any inclination or desire to do so. So perhaps you could kind of update us on your approach there given the shape of the curve?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, Kevin. Thanks for that. As we looked out the curve this morning again what we saw, was despite all of the volatility that we had, the low storage level we have going into the spring, coming out of the winter, what we see is a curve that doesn't reach $5 until you're sometime out in 2020. And so, to us, that underpins our belief that the long-term trading range for natural gas in the United States is going to be sort of supply economics-driven and it's going to be between $3 and $5. So that is unchanged. With respect to our philosophy on hedging, we've done different types of things in the past. But generally, what we're trying to do with our hedging program is to dampen the risk that is associated with near-term volatility in the markets. You can see that we did that to quite good effect in Q1 and we've also got significant amount of hedges as we that we set on for Q2. I can't comment on specifically which competitor you're talking about. But as we sort of -- as we think about things longer-term, would we consider doing something long-term? Sure, it's possible. But typically, what we run into when we talk about long-term deals is, suppliers want to supply above the curve and buyers want to buy below the curve, and so it doesn't make a lot of sense. Our sense is that this is the deepest, most liquid natural gas market in the world. There is not a security of supply issue to be managed here. And we really do focus on really dampening out the near-term volatility. But as I said -- that having been said, we have the ability, with the approval of our board, to do all sorts of other things too if those things made sense. 1 thing I would point out that we have done, or 2 things, is we've got 2 contracts, one with Orica, which we signed this year for ammonium nitrogen, and also the Mosaic deal on ammonia, where we've got margins locked in above gas prices. So we've done some things on the output side to kind of deal with some of that as well. But we remain open but we also remain very committed to our long-term outlook on gas resources development and then the $3 to $5 price range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the potential sales impact from the Woodward outage? Is this a situation where you can catch up based on your current inventory in Q2? Or is this a situation where we may be facing some lost sales because of the 6- to 8-week turnaround in May versus June?","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Tim. Appreciate the question. Obviously, if you're ever down longer than you're planning to be down for a turnaround, you're going to lose some production. But there's a lot of levers that we have to be able to pull in order to make sure that we don't disappoint customers on commitments that we've made. And Bert and his team have done a great job of moving some things around in order to do that. And one of the other levers that we have that we don't spend a lot of time talking about is our ability to shift some turnarounds if we need to. And so, we have decided to push one of the scheduled turnarounds that was previously scheduled for Q4 of this year out into next year and take it in Q1 next year, and that basically leaves us an ability to deliver from a total production standpoint volumes that we were anticipating in our plan at the beginning of the year. And so, the benefit of the network that we have and the scale that we have is we can deal with some of these unplanned outages in a way that other people frankly just can't manage. And as you said, a big chunk of the outage time is being consumed with turnaround activities anyway, which was just going to happen later in the year. So we're trying to minimize the overall impact and we think by the back end of the year, no one will notice that it happened at all.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Great. And 1 last question around, I guess, the labor procurement at your expansion sites. I think there was a media report where the site manager indicated that you've secured 20% of the 2,000 contract workers that you'll need eventually at Port Neal. Can you give us a sense whether that, within your range of estimates at this point and the development of the site? And maybe just give us an update overall across the sites how you're feeling about labor availability? I know you cited that as one of the major challenges as you head out over the next 2 to 3 years in managing that budget.","W. Anthony Will","You bet, Tim. On the labor side for the projects, we're -- we feel very comfortable about where we're at overall. We're in the process of marshaling up to almost kind of 2,500 contract workers at D'Ville. And we're moving up there and we'll soon be at that sort of run rate here within the next month or 2. And we do have good availability of skilled workers for Port Neal as well. And what we're seeing right now in terms of the wage rates that are required to bring those people in, it's very consistent and in line with our original estimates in terms of overall project costs. And there's always puts and calls on these big projects in terms of how they're running. But everything we've locked down in terms of fixed costs were completed much of the way of civil construction and so forth continue to give us full confidence that we're both on schedule and on-budget within plus or minus 10% of the authorized $3.8 billion. So we feel very good about where we're at. A couple of the really large projects that were expected to launch in the Gulf region on the petrochemical side have been delayed. And so that has not sucked up a lot of the skilled contractor base. So again, we feel very comfortable about where we're at right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley of BGC Financial.","Mark R. Gulley - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Two questions. You've talked about capital allocation several times during the call. First question is, can you update us at all on your thoughts on downstream expansions at Medicine Hat, particularly given the low natural gas cost up there and also given the fact that one of your competitors secured a very cheap natural gas cost lease from a Canadian natural gas producer? And then secondly, you also talked about basis differentials on natural gas. You also have that at product prices. Is there anything you can do to get your pipeline partner to expand capacity so you can move ammonia cheaper, more of the cheaper upper -- to the upper Midwest?","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Mark. I'll handle the capital allocation and I'll ask Dennis to talk a little bit about the basis differential and what we're doing to kind of manage and mitigate that going forward. On the capital allocation relative to Medicine Hat, as you noted, there's a very positive spread in the upper Northwest and into western Canada on realized urea prices versus historically ammonia prices. And that's what's making us interested in looking at that kind of project. The challenge in Alberta is -- and a lot of the energy companies in the tar sands and others that have gone after those kind of projects have looked at, which is wage rate and escalation. And so we are being very cautious and very thoughtful about going into this, and it's only if we can lock in some pretty good contracts and some security around what the total cost of construction is that we would be willing to go down that road. So we're in the throes of the discussion. We've got some good help with our technology partners and construction companies and others looking at it. We're going at it full-bore. But we're only going to do it if we can guarantee returns of well above our cost of cap. On the basis differential side, I'll ask Dennis to go ahead and talk about that.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Okay. Thanks. I'll talk about gas basis differentials, Mark, and I'll hand over to Bert to talk about what -- your question with respect to the ammonia pipeline and capacity there. During the quarter, as we pointed out in the press release and in our prepared remarks, we talked about being exposed to some very significant basis swings, particularly at 2 places: One was at Dawn, which is our Courtright facility in Canada; and the other one was at Port Neal, Iowa. And I think we need to put that into context. If you look at Port Neal, Iowa, for instance, the average basis dip for the quarter was about $3.84. There were days, as Tony pointed out, where those differentials widened out to $20 plus, but it would only be for a day or so. Now that occurred after the -- the normal basis differential at Port Neal is around $0.13 per MMBtu, and that's generally very, very stable over time and simply reflects transportation. So obviously, this winter was quite anomalous, we wouldn't expect that to happen on an ongoing basis. So that's what happened in the quarter. With respect to going forward, we've got 50% of our Dawn basis differential hedged for the next 12 months. And we'll look at basis exposure from time to time and we may put hedges in to sort of dampen out that volatility exposure. But this is the sort of things that we, as a gas committee, discuss on a monthly basis and we'll take actions when it makes sense to do so. I'll hand it over to Bert on the ammonia pipeline issue.","Bert A. Frost","So on the pipeline, we use both pipeline systems, primarily the NuStar system, which is the Gulf -- old Gulf States, which goes up into the corn states and the Magellan, which we load out of Verdigris. And so it's more a part of the components that we build for the whole, which are for ammonia. We use the pipelines and the next step up of cost component would be barge movement and then vessel, and then rail and truck. And so we use each of those modes to move the product. I think we're the largest consumer or capacity utilizer on the NuStar up to our terminal locations throughout the Midwest. I'm not sure if they need more capacity. We use all the capacity that we can. When you have 2 application seasons, fall and spring, it's really just a build and then where you could use capacity, or extra capacity, is in November and April for the recharge. So what we've done is invested in Palmyra, which is a receiving point. We're able to load barges out of there and quickly move products on a shuttle service to various terminals in a cost-effective way, as well as just utilizing our terminals that we've invested a significant amount of money over the last several years in order to unload or discharge the terminals and load them and bring product in as fast as possible. So we may shut several terminals off to a certain point to reload a few key terminals at that same moment. So I think it's more how we're maximizing the value of the pipeline is the efficient use of the complete system in the lowest cost manner.","W. Anthony Will","Mark, 1 other thing I'd like to add is that, we're running all of our ammonia plants sort of full out every single day, so we can't really mitigate basis differential changes with ammonia movements because we want to be able to run our end-market plants just as hard we do the ones on the Gulf. So I think it kind of goes back to what Dennis was saying, which is even though we've never really seen this happen before, what we'll likely do to take that volatility out of the equation is to hedge the basis differentials going forward, as well as the underlying gas requirement at Henry Hub and manage it that way instead.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn of Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You briefly mentioned DEF early in your remarks. Could you sketch out that current market for me, what you're shipping today, what's your current ceiling for volumes would be and how gross margins for that product measure up to the mid-product average for the whole complex today in the mid-40s?","W. Anthony Will","Sure. Matthew, good morning. I'll ask Bert to handle that one.","Bert A. Frost","So DEF is a quickly growing market. I think year-on-year, you're seeing growth of 20% to 35%. Just as the new class 8 trucks come in and are integrated into the trucking fleets, there's this sort of direct and dramatic growth, I think, as you see those incorporated. And the next move will be off-road, and then Marine. And then as you get to different-size engines, we project a very positive growth trajectory for DEF. And I think if you look at Integer or any of the other folks in the market, they would project that at a 1.5 million-ton urea equivalent market by 2020. But it could be higher as dosing rates go up due to efficiency standards and things like that. So we're looking -- when you look at the -- that's the market. When you look at volumes, we're consistently participating in a market share of -- actually I hesitate to give that. So we're a healthy participant in that market. And the premiums for the product over granular urea for urea liquor or DEF range in the $50 to $100 per ton.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Alright. Any other promising opportunities you're currently exploring for industrial sales, indexed or gas linked sales? I guess, how active are you in wanting to layer in that kind of lower volatility, perhaps maybe lower margin type of shipment.","Bert A. Frost","The second part of your question is the key component. It depends on the margin. We're not going to pursue it just to get volume. We're not going to pursue just to sign a contract. There has to be something that's attractive for the plant that's supplying the product, for the market that it's in. And if you look at the 2 contracts that we signed, Mosaic was a win-win for both companies. Mosaic was able to acquire the assets that integrate into their system. We're able to supply a great customer a new ammonia contract that fit their needs. For Orica, same principle, a very nice asset base located that's logistically advantaged for them and for us to sign that contract with a healthy margin for the plant and allow that to have a long-term viability was very attractive. If other opportunities came up where we were able to link up with companies that probably have a similar view culture and integration point which, let's say, work well with us and that type of offer is attractive, we would look at that. But again, it's something as we look at the whole component on the margin capability for the business.","W. Anthony Will","And I think the key there -- I would echo what Bert said. The key there is we really only want to partner with a few select, really, leaders in the particular spaces to do this. It's not a broad-based \"we'll take all comers.\" Mosaic is the clear leader in phosphate. We think they're a great customer to have and we're excited about being able to supply them. And we are able to lock in honestly and kind of derisk the return profile of those new -- the new capacity expansion projects and get a mid-teens sort of return on the capital going into that plant. So that made a ton of sense for us, and our contract coming out of Yazoo City was going to expire at the end of '16 with Orica and they're the leader in ammonium nitrate here in North America and again it made sense for us to work with them to secure a home for that production. So we feel very good about those but, to echo what Bert said, it's really aligning around the right customer and finding economics that work for both parties.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I was wondering if you could talk about some of the net backs you might expect for Medicine Hat. Just because with the Viterra stores now owning one of your nitrogen competitors, that may change the dynamic of where you're selling your product in the North?","Bert A. Frost","Regarding net backs or customers or competitors, we look at it holistically. And so, where [indiscernible] are we on, what markets are available to us. We work with all the majors, the major retailers, wholesalers and traders and determine then what product goes to what locations. Obviously, the first I guess step is logistically integrated or logistically advantaged, and that's what we would look at first. So the Canadian market, the Northern tier, is where that product probably will go and is going today. And so, it's -- I don't know if that answered your question, but that's what we're looking at. And I would say North Dakota is probably, for the expansion project, the key market, Montana, that northern region where we have a good market share today.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","And just finally, it's been touched on a couple of times this morning, but do you see more volatility in AECO gas than American gas going forward?","Bert A. Frost","No, I wouldn't think so. Effectively, it's all going to be -- it's all North American gas. Yes, there's a differential in AECO to Henry Hub and that may persist as production comes on in east of the United States and pushes MMBtus back into Canada. But I don't have a view that it's going to necessarily going to be any more volatile or less volatile than the underlying Henry Hub market.","W. Anthony Will","But long term, we do see AECO gas as continuing to be, even though North American gas in aggregate is very attractive compared to the rest of the world, AECO within North America tends to be a real relatively low-cost gas environment. Typically, it's got a basis differential of about $0.50 to $0.70 below Henry Hub. And so that's another reason why that asset at Medicine Hat is so attractive, because the cost structure of that one really, compared to even the rest of our asset base, is very, very attractive.","Operator","And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Tony Will for closing remarks.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks. We're excited about the prospects for CF Industries. We have an experienced and high-performing team executing our plans, the most expansive network of nitrogen production and logistical assets in North America and a structural cost advantage from North American natural gas. With these competitive advantages, we believe in the sustainable cash generation of this business. We also believe in a balanced view of capital deployment, investing in high return projects that leverage our core capabilities, otherwise returning excess cash to stockholders while maintaining an efficient balance sheet. To that end, we made terrific progress on all our strategic initiatives, on our capacity expansion projects, the sale of Phosphate, share repurchases and our investment-grade debt issuance. We are executing a set of strategic initiatives that will significantly grow our nitrogen and cash-generation capacity per share of stock and we believe this focus will enable us to continue delivering terrific results to our shareholders.

Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the second quarter of 2016, in which we generated EBITDA of $329 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $342 million, after taking into account unrealized mark-to-market hedging gains, costs related to the termination of the OCI transaction, net foreign currency losses on intercompany loans, and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects. Included in these results and not adjusted for is a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $61 million.","For the first half 2016, EBITDA was $536 million, while adjusted EBITDA was $642 million, after taking into account the same factors as for the second quarter. The first half results include a realized loss on natural gas hedges of $117 million, which was not adjusted for. So, even with the challenging conditions in the global fertilizer market, our underlying business performance remains strong.","Before turning the call over to Bert and Dennis to give details on the quarter, I want to provide some observations and thoughts about the nitrogen market, and our response to current industry conditions. There are some industry elements that are more structural and permanent in nature, while others tend to be more temporal. Fortunately, the elements that are structural tend to be strengths and benefit CF.","These include: the global nitrogen demand continues to grow at roughly 2% per year so there is strength underpinning our industry; natural gas represents about two-thirds to three-quarters of the cash cost of producing nitrogen; and North America has a long-term natural gas cost advantage. North America is one of the largest nitrogen consumption regions, where demand far exceeds domestic supply, and therefore, it's heavily dependent upon the imported products.","CF is the world's low-cost nitrogen leader with the largest North American interior production and distribution system. CF's nutrient ton production will increase by more than 25% in the next few months and, as a result, CF has the enviable position of being structurally advantaged and one of the profitable nitrogen manufacturers in the world with significant growth imminent.","However, the industry is under pressure, facing several significant challenges. Fortunately, these issues tend to be more transitory in nature, and include: the nitrogen industry is in the state of significant overcapacity with additional new capacity yet to still come on stream through 2017. However there is little to no new capacity additions currently in flight beyond 2017, and with underlying demand growth in nitrogen, the global supply demand balance should start to resolve beginning in 2018.","The combination of excess nitrogen capacity with lower global energy costs, coupled with devaluation of certain key currencies and assisted by low transoceanic freight, have led to the dramatic fall in nitrogen product prices. We expect this situation to persist in the near-term with prices under continued pressure for 2017. However, even in these conditions, CF enjoys greater than 30% gross margins. I want to pause for a moment and reemphasize this last point. We operate in the commodity business and, even in the face of significant industry overcapacity with prices that have cratered, CF Industries was able to deliver first half 2016 gross margin of 35%.","How was that possible in a commodity industry, you might ask. The answer is, although the global cost curve has widened with new capacity additions and has flattened because of lower global energy costs, it is certainly not flat, far from it. North America producers still enjoy a very significant advantage. With our realized price of urea at roughly $250 per ton in the second quarter and gas around $3 per MMBtu, the typical North American producer earns approximately 50% cash margin on incremental production. The takeaway here is that not all commodities are created equally and we occupy the very advantaged position within the nitrogen industry.","Current industry conditions are at a level that we believe is unsustainable over the medium-term. Pricing is below cash cost for a significant amount of total global production, and industry profitability in many regions is too low to support normal maintenance and turnaround activity, let alone equity returns, and certainly well below that required for investments in new capacity. This situation is leading to curtailment or permanent closure of high cost production.","China alone has announced closure of over 4 million tons of urea, since the first quarter and over 7.5 million tons year-to-date, with utilization rates currently around 60%. Similarly, producers in countries with relatively high costs such as Lithuania, Hungary, and the Ukraine have utilization rates under 60% as well. The net result is that, although we expect difficult industry pricing conditions to persist through the next year, the lack of meaningful new construction activity after 2017 coupled with expected capacity closures is expected to lead to price recovery beginning in 2018.","Against this backdrop, CF's long-term strategy remains unchanged, which is to: focus on operational excellence by being the safe, efficient, reliable operator of our assets, while maximizing returns by leveraging our world-leading production and distribution network; grow our cash flow per share by delivering accretive initiatives with returns well above our cost of capital; and maintain investment-grade ratings and a strong balance sheet, after which excess cash is returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Our plan over the next 18 months is consistent with our longstanding strategy and addresses the current challenging industry environment. Specifically, we will complete and start up our major expansion projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. At Donaldsonville, we have fired up the reformer and expect ammonia production to begin during this quarter. At Port Neal, offsites and utilities are complete and operational, and ammonia production is expected to begin late-third quarter or early fourth quarter, with the urea plant to follow closely thereafter.","We will reduce annual CapEx to less than $450 million starting next year. This level of spend allows for continued safe, reliable and compliant operations, while reducing discretionary spending and conserving cash. We will reduce our controllable expenses, and we'll maintain a strong balance sheet by preserving cash. To do this, we have suspended our share repurchase program, and we will be in a position to delever in 2018, when $800 million of debt matures.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis, who will discuss our performance for the quarter and our outlook in more detail. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Given the challenging market for nitrogen, we are pleased with our sales results from the quarter, as they demonstrate the active role we take in responding to shifts in global supply and demand, market opportunities and customer needs. The lower pricing environment of the second quarter was driven by global oversupply, with an excess of tons targeted to the U.S., despite NOLA and Tampa trading below international parity.","In North America, the quarter began with solid demand at the beginning of April that helped to support selling prices. The strong run we witnessed in March for ammonia applications resulted in a portion of seasonal demand being pulled forward into the first quarter, which had a negative impact on the volume of second quarter ammonia shipments. The positive pricing position during the first quarter lasted for approximately three weeks into the second quarter, after which pricing moved steadily lower for all products.","In early April, it was a tale of two Corn Belts in the U.S., with western farms planting on time, while the eastern states were hampered by several weeks of wet and cold weather that delayed fertilizer applications in the middle of the season. This delay allowed wholesalers and traders a window to import additional product and supply eventually exceeded demand. As a result, pricing fell throughout the quarter and hit levels that did not appear to make economic sense. By the middle of the quarter, wholesale liquidation took place, pushing prices even lower, with importers struggling to generate cash positive returns.","The combination of additional imported product and subsequent liquidation pressured the urea barge market down below $200 per short ton FOB NOLA by early May. By the end of the quarter, the NOLA value for urea had fallen to just below $175 a short ton. Against this backdrop, the company's realized price for urea during the second quarter was $247 per short ton, a significant premium to prices reported at the U.S. Gulf.","CF also responded to changing conditions by actively leveraging our scale, efficiency and expertise in distribution, targeting new alternative destinations and logistical options. Our fleet of over 5,500 railcars and 32 barges is complemented by over 2.5 million tons of North American storage and access to both the NuStar and Magellan ammonia pipelines.","The recent completion of our re-injection terminal at Garner, Iowa affords us new flexibility in how we move ammonia throughout the pipeline. By gaining the ability to reinject ammonia at this site, it allows our teams to instantaneously transport product from the western Corn Belt to the eastern Corn Belt, which is a tremendous benefit to have, as Port Neal comes on later this year.","In rail, we are identifying new approaches in how we can better transport additional volume. In the prior year, our teams did not have a single unit train depart the Donaldsonville site. In 2016, however, we have loaded 19 unit trains to-date. For those who may not be familiar with shipping, unit trains become increasingly economical as the volume transported increases. And with the capacity expansion projects coming online, we have leveraged that additional volume to our benefit.","Additionally, the recent drafts of the Surface Transportation Board's language on competitive switching are encouraging and present additional opportunities to streamline rail distribution routes and reduce costs.","Our team also responded to changes in the domestic fertilizer business through our ability to switch production quickly and safely from one product to another. As I described earlier, imports continue to pressure NOLA urea prices late in the quarter. However, during this time, UAN was trading at a premium to urea on a nitrogen equivalent basis. We responded to this opportunity by pivoting our capacity to maximize our UAN production at the expense of urea. As a result, we were able to better capture the nutrient basis differential that was priced into the market at that time. This helped to improve our average price per ton for UAN, which was $202 per short ton for the second quarter of 2016. Many of our investors have heard us describe this capability that's built into our system before. And the second quarter was a prime example of our production and distribution flexibility in action.","In aggregate, the combined result of an increased focus on system-wide maximization was healthy price realizations across the three major products: ammonia, urea, and UAN, that were notably higher when compared to the reference published prices at NOLA and Tampa.","We believe that 2016 denotes the high-water mark for urea capacity additions globally. And we do not expect any new capacity to be added to the global system beyond 2017 and into the foreseeable future. As we have said many times, farmers must apply nitrogen every year to feed the world. As such, global demand for nitrogen continues to grow at an approximate rate of between 1.5% and 2.5% per year or the equivalent of 2.7 million metric tons to 4.6 million metric tons of gross urea capacity.","While this continued demand growth will absorb excess supply in the coming years, as Tony said, we see tangible evidence today that suggests that additional rationalizations should continue to occur throughout the global system. In the current pricing environment, estimates indicate that, despite the decrease in the cost curve, many global nitrogen producers are estimated to be operating at or near their variable costs. The result thus far has been more than 8 million short tons of global urea capacity that has been shut down in 2016 with the vast majority of that capacity located in China.","The steady decrease in Chinese operating rates to the lowest point in more than four years support this observation. In periods of decreased domestic pricing, Chinese producers have historically looked at the export market. However, the trailing 12-month average of their exports has declined steadily, since its peak in July of 2015, when prices globally were notably higher than they are today. Accordingly, Chinese exports are expected to reach full year volume of approximately 9 million metric tons to 10 million metric tons in 2016 compared to more than 14 million metric tons exported in 2015.","Domestic prices in China are down approximately 30% year-over-year. And at a price of $195 per metric ton FOB China for export, we estimate that up to half of the urea industry in China is unprofitable.","Moving on to the North American natural gas market, April Henry Hub cash prices began the second quarter below $2 per MMBTU, aided by a warmer-than-normal first quarter. Cash prices traded as low as $1.71 per MMBtu in mid-April, primarily due to a healthy storage balance and reduced demand coming out of winter.","After ending the withdrawal season with nearly 2.5 Tcf in storage, strong demand and production declines contributed to a slower-than-normal start to the injection season. Throughout the quarter, natural gas prices have trended upward with smaller than average storage injections and forecast for a warm summer contributing to the increases. On June 30, natural gas traded at $2.93 in the cash market, an increase of $1.22 per MMBtu from the quarter low.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the second quarter of 2016, we generated $329 million of EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.20. Included in these results were, on a pre-tax basis, approximately $211 million in unrealized net mark-to-market gains on our natural gas derivatives, $165 million in transaction costs, mainly comprised of the termination fee of $150 million paid to OCI, $38 million of net foreign currency losses related to intercompany loans, and $19 million in expansion costs for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities.","When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $342 million, and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.33. Included in these results is a realized loss of $61 million or $0.75 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges.","In 2017, we expect to receive a refund of approximately $690 million related to the carryback of certain U.S. tax losses from the current year to prior tax years associated with the bonus depreciation provision of the PATH Act. The amount of this refund is dependent upon the timing and completion for certain capital projects. As of June 30, 2016, our prepaid income taxes were $855 million, including approximately the $690 million related to the carryback of these U.S. tax losses.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 53.2% and was impacted by the following items. First, we've recaptured the manufacturing profits deduction we took in 2014, when we decided to carry back current tax losses to that year. Second, we established a valuation allowance against certain differed tax assets related to our foreign operations. These were partially offset by the deduction of previously capitalized OCI transaction costs. The net effect of these three items is about a 20% increase in our tax rate. Excluding these items, our tax rate for the second quarter would have been closer to the statutory rate of 35%.","Interest expense for the second quarter was $61 million and included the following: $76 million in interest on our outstanding debt, plus $32 million in amortization of loan fees, which included amounts related to the terminated bridge loan associated with the OCI transaction, less $47 million in capitalized interest.","The first distribution from CF Nitrogen to CHS, under our strategic venture with them, occurred on August 1, 2016 for $75 million. This total is comprised of approximately $30 million related to the partial first quarter of 2016, during which the strategic venture commenced and approximately $45 million related to the second quarter of 2016. If you recall, each quarter, we've recognized a non-controlling interest amount related to this investment, which for the first quarter was $17 million, and for the second quarter, was $23 million.","However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS maybe different from the amount recorded as non-controlling interest in any given period based on the terms of our agreements, which in effect provide producer economics to CHS. For 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range $2 billion to $2.2 billion, of which $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion will be for the capacity expansion projects, and $450 million to $500 million for sustaining improvement and other projects.","The increase in project spend is mainly related to labor productivity issues with third-party contractors. For 2017, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. This will focus on sustaining capital to ensure our plants and facilities operate in a safe, complaint and reliable fashion.","As Tony mentioned, we are reducing discretionary capital expenditures, sustaining a strong liquidity position, and maintaining and defending our investment-grade credit ratings. On July 29, 2016 the company amended its senior unsecured revolving credit agreement to reduce the size of the facility from $2 billion back to the $1.5 billion in place prior to the announcement of the OCI transaction, and to increase the maximum total net leverage covenant from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2017.","We have provided a schedule in the press release that goes over the details. This will provide us with additional liquidity and flexibility, should be needed. We are also in the process of seeking a similar amendment from our private placement note holders. As of June 30, 2016, we were well in compliance with all covenants on our indebtedness. The amendment we have made to our revolver and the amendment we are seeking to make to our private placement notes reflect the prudent and proactive manner in which we manage our capital structure.","Additionally, we have been making reductions in our controlled book costs by managing down activity in M&A and information technology, along with a reduction in third-party plant-level contractor expenses.","With that, Tony will provide closing remarks, before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. CF's business model, assets, and team are resilient. Although falling energy prices, capacity growth and currency devaluations have created an extended period of low prices, CF's structural advantages continue. Ultimately, we believe higher cost capacity will shut down, leading to a recovery in nitrogen prices and margins. We remain among the lowest cost nitrogen producers in the world, have significant eminent growth in the next few months, and have advantaged access to the world's largest consumption regions. Our business remains strong, and we have a bright future ahead.","With that, we will now open the line to your questions. Danielle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a courtesy to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Should you have additional questions, we ask that you reenter the queue. We will answer additional questions, as time allows. And our first question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. There's been a little more noise surrounding some of the various summer field programs this year, particularly on UAN. Just what's your assessment thus far on volume commitments? And do you feel that some of your competitors have been more aggressive than in past years? Just any general remarks would be very helpful. Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. The summer field program was different than in previous years. We launched it much later than normal, and that was on purpose. We have been following and talking with our retailer and customer friends, and realized that the desire to take on additional products late in Q2 was just not there. And we have the capability to manage our system, like I said earlier in my prepared remarks, with different production levels at the plants as well as inventory and exports, and that's what we did. And so we ended up launching the program late in July, where normally it's been a June launch, and that afforded us the opportunity to participate more in the end market, tail-end of the application season in a higher net back position was the result.","But it also allowed our customers not take maybe a month to a month-and-a-half of additional product into their inventory, when they weren't prepared to do so. So looking at this year and where we are on volume for the field program, our program at first was received a little coolly. Our prices probably were higher than what the market had anticipated, but as we've rolled it out and had conversations with our customers, it has been received better, and we have been taking on orders, and we're already shipping against some of those.","And so, what we look towards is, the program was not designed to be as big as it had been in the past. We expect that there will be an improved market and we want to participate in that market as we roll forward. And so we have taken on an acceptable amount of volume and we will continue to do so, as we go. And regarding the competitors and other people, I think there were some competitors who just weren't able to wait as long as we did or they maybe saw a different market than we did, and probably received a lower netback than we are.","And some of that was also driven by imports. There are imports that come into this market, where we continue to be an import market, and I think will be into the foreseeable future for all of the end products. And I think some of the other producers outside of the United States decided to target some of their shipments probably at lower prices. And so, we'll see that as the end values mature. You will see those coming back closer to their historical range and the market will move forward.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful color. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up for Dennis, as we head into 2017, is there anything to think about regarding the cadence of the $690 million in tax refunds? Is that just all contingent on past profitability or forward profitability and what's already been paid in cash taxes? Just any color would be appreciated.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think our sense of the timing is, it's probably the receipt of it is around third quarter of next year. And obviously, that depends on getting your returns in and all the rest, that sort of thing, but no, there is not really \u2013 and then, as I said in my remarks, the actual amount of it is dependent on getting certain equipment online over a certain time period. And so, what the $690 million represents is our best estimate of what that's going to be given all of the factors that you've talked about.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's great color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. I want to suss out a little more about your commentary that you don't feel that nitrogen price is really going to improve until \u2013 I think you said, the end of 2017, as some of the supply additions come on. Can you maybe just elaborate more, are you talking about you don't feel like floor and ceiling prices are going to rise or that you don't think that prices are going to rise much off spot prices? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I'll give you a high level, Joel, and then I'll let Bert chime in here as well, but as we think about kind of aggregate price over the year with all the new capacity coming on, and until you see some significant shutdowns and allow that new capacity be absorbed based on underlying demand growth, we think that continues to put sort of a ceiling on where pricing trades for the products over the next 18 months.","Now, the things that can change that are, if we see more rationalization sooner relative to the production base that's out there, you'll start seeing recovery more quickly or if you start seeing some more historical deltas in terms of energy prices around the globe that are reintroduced that can also accelerate the rate of price recovery.","But I think, our view is, at the end of the day, I think given the status quo assumption about ocean freight and where energy prices are trading, with the net amount of new production that's still coming online over the next 18 months, it's going to be tough sledding here for a number of competitors. We don't see really a catalyst driving prices substantively higher.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I agree. Joel, good morning. I think when you look at where we've been in the last six months, with a low of, let's say $165 NOLA to $265 for urea, UAN in the high-$130s to $215, and Midwest ammonia from $300 to $530, we have an actual, a pretty wide spread that has occurred just in the last six months. And I anticipate that that type of spread will continue as we see retailer activity on resisting taking inventory, that opportunity to expand even further the price spread happens.","And so, what you see us doing is managing our production, managing our exports, managing our distribution assets, working with our customers. We have contractual commitments as well as spot commitments, to make sure that we're producing at a high level, moving our product, and anticipating some of these swings and capturing some of those.","So I don't think you can strip out the lows, and then factor those in for another year and a half, because I do think it's going to be a dynamic market. But as we steadily move into it, and as Tony mentioned, some of these catalysts that are driving some of these changes, currency, freight, gas, petroleum, and then overall demand, which we see increasing, I think they'll improve over time. So I'm positive, but I want to be realistic in how we view the market.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","That was very helpful. And then, my second question would be, one of your large competitors in nitrogen last night indicated that a lot of buyers in North America have \u2013 didn't buy product in the summer because of supply additions and they see a lot of pent-up demand in the upcoming application periods. Can you comment on what you're seeing under that light as well?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I can't imagine who that competitor would be that would \u2013 no, we saw that comment. And we agree with that perspective, and we're seeing that. Imports coming in are lower, and it's a realistic perspective from a retail outlook saying, I'm not sure as a retailer, I want to take that position. Fine, we say, as a producer, that we will manage our system and we will work with you, our retail friends, to make sure that we supply the product at a comfortable position and risk profile for them, but don't expect those prices to be there when you want to buy. And that's exactly what we saw in the spring, was as demand was pulled forward, prices escalated very quickly, and so that's the dynamic nature of this business that I was speaking of earlier, and that we expect to continue.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick one, so as you look into next year in the U.S., when farmers most likely are likely to plant less corn and you're going to have more capacity additions coming to the market in nitrogen, how much more you think prices can go down? I mean like, are we getting closer to a floor, where guys will have to shut down very quickly because if volume's coming down, capacity going up, that definitely will put significant pressure on prices?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Edlain, good morning. So a couple of things here, one of which is, over the last few years, even though the amount of planted corn acreage has moved around a little bit, the aggregate amount of nitrogen nutrient tonnage has remained relatively flat. I mean, it's moved by a couple hundred thousand tons here or there, but it has not been a dramatic swing one direction or another. And even with all the new capacity coming online in North America, we will still be a substantial net importer of nitrogen. We'll need about 30% of our total nitrogen requirements to be met from imports. And North American producers are among the lowest cost producers globally.","So anyone that's got assets that are producing here in North America are going to run those plants flat out, and if there is trimming to be done on the global scene from a production standpoint, it's going to be in the high cost regions. So it will be the Chinese anthracite people who'll continue to shut down; some of the high cost Eastern European gas countries like, as we mentioned, Ukraine, Lithuania, Hungary, and so forth; and then there are other regions where there is either, sort of, gas availability problems and you see curtailments like in Trinidad, for example, or in other regions where there is political instability, like Libya for example, where you also see some production coming off-line.","So, as we look forward, one of the reasons we believe that pricing continues to be under pressure next year is the fact that there is this new capacity that you talked about coming online, but we don't really believe it's fundamentally going to move pricing dramatically lower than, where it sits today, because we already think there is a number of \u2013 substantial volume of capacity is already operating below cash cost, so it really can go substantially lower than where we are, and it's certainly not going to affect the operating rates of North American producers.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, thank you. And one quick one, like, in terms of production, so as we look into next year, when all your plants are up and running, and if you still running at full operating rates, like, how much sales volume, like, in nitrogen will you have available at that stage , let's say, we look at the end of 2017 or so?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","If you're asking what will we have available at CF?","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Yes.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We run our plants at capacity every day. So we're obviously looking to optimize our production capacity based on ammonia and what's available, and then how we can upgrade which is the higher-margin product for urea, UAN, and ammonia. And so, if you look at the aggregate number, it's going to be just based on our capacity and we will move that product into the global market as well as the U.S., but I'd say 18 million tons.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That's product tons not nutrient tons.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, guys. That's what I was looking for. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Happy summer to you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","You too.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So, you've all been pretty consistent in your call, of course, for U.S. natural gas prices to remain low. In your deck, you're laying out this view of what's available at $3.50. I'm interested in your view on the medium to long-term relative natural gas cost in exporting regions like Ukraine, where your cost curve notes in your presentation acknowledges there's been substantial year-over-year compression in the spread versus the U.S. price. How do you regard the threat that a globally more evened out energy price environment could place a cap on your profitably going forward, even once we see some of this excess supply today absorbed?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, as we look at the factors, Matthew, that could affect that, one of the big ones is just where Russia Gazprom prices their exports to places like the Ukraine and so forth. There is another one that is kind of how LNG continues to evolve and how much of the new production ends up moving off of, kind of, oil-linked based contracts more onto a spot basis.","I think, over time, it's about $3 or $4 to get any sort of reasonable capital recovery on LNG contracts. And so, if you say Henry Hub trades at, kind of, $3, that means LNG importing regions to trade somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 or maybe a little bit above, by the time re-gas and distribute from their end to the production plant. So, as we look forward, our view is, we're likely to be able to enjoy, call it, $4 plus or minus advantage over most of the rest of the kind of importing, or gas deficient regions.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think, Matthew, the other thing, I think, you necessarily have to look at, when you talk about energy costs, you've really got to kind of look at oil. And what we do know is, with the low oil prices that we've seen, you've seen oil exploration drop off by major oil companies. They're not putting the, kind of, money into the deepwater and the Arctic and these more frontier regions that they used to be, in terms of exploration development. In addition to that, we've also seen development activity in North America with respect to onshore oil production come off as well. So eventually, the problem solves itself. The stuff that's on continues to decline, the declines don't get replaced with new projects and, eventually, the oil market straightens out. The question is how far off are we from that happening. Today, it doesn't look like it's near, but certainly at some point, the piper has to be paid, because if investment hasn't gone into the exploration and development, eventually the supply dries up, and the demand has \u2013 while the demand is growing.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. I appreciate that. Let me ask this then as a follow-up, you actually cover a number of companies that are benefiting pretty substantially from political efforts that have resulted in trade restrictions. And I saw last month that Commerce is moving ahead with its investigation on claimed ammonium sulfate dumping and\/or unfair subsidies out of China. What's the potential for you in like the domestic nitrogen industry? This may sound way out there, but to pursue more of these kinds of measures, particularly now that the threshold for, quote-unquote, damage, at the hands of overseas product has been somewhat reduced and the nitrogen for requirement itself is reduced?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. It's something that we continue to investigate and look at. As you could appreciate, these cases are fairly complex and take a long time to get there. One of the issues of bringing a new damage claim is, the demonstration of financial harm and there is a baseline threshold in terms of profitability and the challenge a little bit is, even though pricing is down, margins are down, profitability is down, our gross margins for the first half of the year were still 35% for the second quarter, over 45%. And the problem is that that level of profitability, the Commerce Department doesn't have a lot of time and interest in talking about the economic harm that we may have suffered. So, something we continue to look at, we probe, but there is not a lot of, I would say, imminent movement likely to happen in that regard.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. Thank you. Slide 17 in the presentation does not exclusively call out India, I was hoping you could comment on how their push for greater self-sufficiency is factored into your estimates. And then post 2016, I might have missed it, but do you have a forecast for Chinese urea exports?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Slide 17...","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sorry, slide 13, where you showed the capacity additions and closures. And maybe India is factored into the other component, but I was wondering if it does factor into the outlook.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So, India does show up in other, in both 2015, 2016, and I think in the 2017. But I think there is only one or two plants that we're talking about that are net new capacity that's coming online. So it's not a huge volume of production.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","When you look at India though, just for a quick comment, they're a huge market at over 30 million tons of consumption with 21 million tons, 22 million tons of that produced and 8 million tons more or less imported. And when you look at the gas constraints, the energy constraints, the power constraints, you have a hard time looking at that as an opportunity to build urea plans, when you can import that at below their production cost and that energy is not being directed to the public's better use. There have been a lot of announcements on new capacity, but most years there are announcements and most years those don't happen.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other things is, in India, in particular, because there are such heavy subsidies and price controls in place, the return profile that you are able to potentially get there is really subject to government control and there's no guarantees everywhere in a commodity market that's tough enough, even in the places like the U.S. But when you are operating in an environment where the end product maybe subject to pricing controls, where it limits the price that you're able to charge in the domestic market, it's really a difficult thing to get your mind around wanting to put new capital in the ground over there.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","A new plant that was built two years ago, that still does not have gas supplied to it and it has not operated. And that's 1.2 million tons urea plant sitting idle. So I have a hard time, with Tony, how can you invest when you don't even have gas for your current plants.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. And just as follow-up, nitrogen advisory services are obviously a key component of precision ag platforms. How do you expect this to impact the application rates? And do you expect it to lead to any change in grower preferences between different grades of nitrogen?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, one of the things that we see, Sandy, is, across a couple of different initiatives, one of which is, the 4R Nutrient Stewardship programs that have been rolled out, which is to minimize the environmental impact or loss to the environment of nutrients, keep the applied nutrients where they should be in the field and available for the crop, changes around a little bit, sort of, the application, intensity, away from the fall and more of it into the spring and over the course of the spring, instead of just one big dump.","But one of the benefits of the targeted precision ag is higher crop densities. And so, if you're going to get the same kind of yield with higher density, you actually need to get an increase of nitrogen application per acre in order to accomplish anything at the grower level. So we do see those trends kind of moving in a direction that is, I would say, net-net positive for us over the long run. It might change the form a little bit or the timing of when that happens from the fall more into the spring, but that's one of the benefits that Bert talked about with our extensive flexible distribution network that we're willing to inventory product and, kind of, take that risk off of the hands of the retailer, and then capitalize on the opportunity, when the application season does come. So, for us, we look at all of those trends as being net positive for a business.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the Chinese export tariff. The Chinese producers appear to be lobbying the government to reduce it or get rid of it entirely. It seems to me that if they get rid of it, it's just going to lower the price, anyway, but how important do you think that decision is by the Chinese government at this point to sort of indicate their desire or willingness to support the industry or to kind of push it more towards the rationalization and environmental cleanup phase?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","What we see, again, from China, every year is a different year, and every year is a different pronouncement or program coming out of China. If you look at the base model of China, we have unsustainable coal prices, unsustainable logistics, unsustainable issues in terms of pollution and just areas surrounding what's being produced and exported. And so they are going to have to rationalize, and we see that taking place with 8 million tons coming off, and we expect additional rationalization and, if pricing remains at its current level, possibly permanent shutdowns.","The export tariff is about $12 per ton. So, if today, \u2013 and this number has been moving, but Chinese urea is quoted in the $195 to $200 range FOB for granular. And so you cut that price down to, let's say, $185, you're still, one, quality is poor, or less \u2013 it's not received as well as our products or some of the products coming out of the Arab Gulf. And so is that enough for them to compete? I don't think $12 is going to get them over the hump to allow them to compete on a consistent basis at the current market.","So we expect to see \u2013 they need to have rationalizations, their domestic industry cannot support the total capacity they have. So, like Tony said, they're operating at a 60% to 65% operating rate and their exports are trending down. All those are trends that in the lowest cost, probably, position that they will have with, again, coal being low, currency around 6.65 yuan, and so, the only thing probably going forward, I would say, moderating is moderating up on all those issues. So you can get $12 on your export tariff, you're probably going to lose that to raw material costs and freight costs over time.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And in particular, in that regard, the subsidy on electrical used in energy intensive industries is going away as is freight. And so, to Bert's point, we see a number of things that are offsetting to the higher cost side, internal to China, that will either be a net increase in the cost structure in aggregate or at least offset any kind of reduction in the export tariff.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, just as a follow-up, I saw last night, a note that indicated that SABIC is trying to raise urea prices by about $20. Is that something that you're hearing? Do you think that has the ability to stick? I mean, clearly, that region has been the big importer into the U.S. this year?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. SABIC does a good job. I mean, they move their products all around the world. They have contracts into the U.S. They have contracts into Thailand and Australia, and so they try to ratably move their product around the world. We're seeing \u2013 I can't really comment on them raising prices other than that, I think what you're seeing in NOLA, which is our market, the low of $160, $165, we're now at $185 and probably even moving up from that. So prices are slowly moving up. I think that's in recognition of when you look at the UAN and urea comparison, both of those products are trading at a very good value.","And actually moving forward with maybe another question, looking at how farmers should be looking at nutrients for fall applications and even spring applications. Yes, corn is down at, let's say, $3.40 for a forward harvest position of corn, but ammonia has moderated equally down, and all the nutrients are down. So on a nutrient basis, it's still profitable to plant, and we see consumption to be fairly strong.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other issue on that one is, we think that there is such a substantial portion of the global capacity that's operating at or below cash cost that I think somewhere in the range that you're talking about is necessary just to keep supply available over the medium-term anyway. So, I think that's kind of what has to happen over time.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much, guys.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Your interest expense, your book interest expense is running at about $140 million or so a year, ex-non-recurring items. Does that number go up to roughly $300 million next year, when you can no longer capitalize your interest? I understand it doesn't change the cash interest that you pay, but does your book interest go up to about $300 million? And when you receive the $690 million tax refund, are your plans to repay debt with that?","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, let's start with the first piece, the answer to that is yes. Once we stop capitalizing interest, Jeff, we'll be back around $300 million a year towards expense. As you know, our interest payments quarterly run around $75 million, $76 million a quarter, so that won't change. It just won't be capitalizing anymore and they will start to go to expense.","With respect to the cash from the refund, I don't really sort of think of it that way, because cash is all fungible, the cash will come in the door, and it along with the operating cash flow that we generate and other sources obviously, will be used for a whole number of \u2013 obviously running the operation and a whole number of other things. But what I would do is just sort of repeat Tony's comment. We're going to build cash on our balance sheet, so we've got the flexibility to take out that $800 million in 2018, if we have to do that to defend our ratings.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great, And for my follow-up, I think, (52:27) will bring on about 1 million tons of ammonia in the fourth quarter, with the phosphate operations not really starting up maybe until mid-year next year, do you think that that capacity will make a difference to the global ammonia market or do you think it doesn't make much of a difference?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, when you look at the additions to ammonia that are coming on, not just SABIC's, but Dyno's plant in Waggaman, our own, yes, there is additional capacity coming on. Traditionally the Arab Gulf ammonia tons stay in the East. And so supplying South Korea, Japan and some of the caprolactam production there. And so they've done good job of managing their production supply, so any additional supply, you have to watch and see how it goes, I can't give you a number on what that could be.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","One of the benefits we have a little bit, Jeff, in that regard which is, the seaborne ammonia trade doesn't directly impact kind of our ag markets, because unless you've got the end market cryogenic storage, which really only the producers have, you otherwise can't move anhydrous ammonia from the Gulf or from Tampa, up into the Corn Belt. And so, while it affects some of our industrial-based contract business, it doesn't really affect our ag business that much.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Good. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","This is Ben Richardson (54:06), sitting in for Don. Wanted to ask a question about the timing of your startups and how that might affect mix, both the Donaldsonville facility and the Port Neal facility.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So the upgrades are running at Donaldsonville currently. And so when the ammonia plant starts off, that doesn't really affect mix at all. It does add additional new ammonia production to the network. And as you know, we have a pretty sizable supply agreement in place with Mosaic that's going to start up at the beginning of next year. So a big piece of those tons are already spoken for beginning next year in terms of where they're going.","Relative to Port Neal, we have the urea plant attached to the ammonia plant, we would expect to run the urea plant absolutely full out, with the excess being some incremental anhydrous that shows up in Port Neal, but generally speaking, we're going to want to run that urea plant flat out. And there isn't a lot of ability to move the mix in Port Neal. There is a couple of the hundred thousand tons, so we can flex back and forth between urea and UAN, but generally speaking, the new plants are just going to come on in and, kind of, run at capacity.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe first a question for Dennis, I know you talked about preserving cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the 2018 maturity. Is there anything you could do to accelerate that or you got the cash basically sitting there at this point? I know there is a call premium on the bonds, but other options on tenders, or anything like that that you could explore?","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean when we've looked at the 2018 bonds, last time we looked at it, Adam, effectively the make-all provision on it or the premium that it's trading at in the market were roughly about the same. And I think our philosophy is, A, we don't need to do that, and, B, if I'm going to be paying somebody to use his money, then I'm going to use his money. So there really is \u2013 there's not really a lot of economics in that and there really isn't a need to do it. I think it's just a matter of having the liquidity available at the time to repay that, if we have to do that to defend our rating.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then on market, just hoping you could talk a little bit about export out of the Gulf and your ability \u2013 how you're doing on driving some increased export opportunities? I would guess UAN is the bigger priority into South America, maybe size what that potential could be over the next 12 months to 18 months, 24 months.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So we have been exploring the export opportunities for the company over the last several years in preparation for the additional capacity that's coming online, and the upgrading capacity already has come online. So this year, you've seen us export all three of the major products, ammonia, urea, and UAN. Smaller for ammonia and urea. And for UAN, we'll hit a record this year and we're exploring all different kinds of markets. We've been shipping product to Europe, to Argentina, as well as opening new markets in Colombia, Chile, and Brazil.","And we're excited about the opportunities in South America, because we do believe in the benefits of UAN and that's being received well, and so the growth is there. So, I think you will see us continue to grow those opportunities, but it is weighted against, obviously, netback options and what's best for the company.","So, I think urea will grow as we bring the capacity online. If we have a differential again like we've had in the first six months of this year, where the U.S. traded at discount to the international market, then we have a pretty good incentive to export the products out of the United States. So, today, I would say all going well will be less than 1 million tons of total exports for the year out of Donaldsonville.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Dan Aldridge for closing remarks.","Dan A.

We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation.","I'd now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining the CF Industries third quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its third quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook, and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the third quarter and for the first nine months of 2018, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $300 million and approximately $1.1 billion, respectively. This compares to adjusted EBITDA of $134 million and $709 million for the same periods in 2017, a 50% increase year-to-date over 2017 results.","We added $294 million of cash to the balance sheet during the quarter, while at the same time repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $90 million.","Including activities after the quarter end, through October 31, we have repurchased a cumulative total of 3 million shares for approximately $150 million, which leaves $350 million still remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. Cash on the balance sheet stands at approximately $1.1 billion as of this call.","These results reflect continued strong execution by the CF team against the backdrop of an improving market environment. We are operating well, and most importantly we're doing it safely. Our rolling 12-month recordable incident rate at the end of the quarter was 0.67 incidents per 200,000 work hours, considerably better than industry averages. And as Bert will discuss, we are very well-positioned for the fourth quarter and the upcoming spring application season.","Longer term, we believe global market fundamentals will continue to enable CF Industries to generate significant cash through the foreseeable future. First, we expect the global nitrogen supply and demand balance to continue to tighten. Global demand for nitrogen has grown at a long-term annual rate of approximately 2% per year. At the same time, net global urea supply additions are expected to fall short of this rate as you can see on slide 10 in our materials.","All the new nitrogen capacity in North America has been running for some time and there are a limited number of new plants expected to be started up globally through 2022. Because it takes roughly four years to construct an ammonia\/urea complex, it is unlikely that significant capacity will come online during this time period beyond what is already visibly under construction today.","Second, we believe global energy fundamentals are likely to drive international hydrocarbon prices higher, while at the same time, North American natural gas prices should continue to remain low. CF benefits greatly from this spread as it elevates production cost for the upper half of the global nitrogen supply curve, while keeping our production costs low as estimated in our 2019 cost curve shown on slide 15.","As Dennis will go into more detail later, global investments in oil and gas exploration and development since 2014 have declined dramatically. U.S. shale, however, has seen increased investments. This resulted in higher production in the U.S., which kept natural gas in North America trading around $3 per MMBtu, despite the strong growth in U.S. gas demand.","In fact, the NYMEX forward curve for gas is priced well below $3 per MMBtu through 2025. We believe these factors will support CF's structural cost advantages in the years ahead. Along with our consistent operational performance, this should further strengthen our cash generation, and allow us to create significant shareholder value.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk about the market environment in more detail, then Dennis will discuss our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Our performance during the third quarter has positioned CF well, as we work through our fall ammonia book and continue preparations for the spring application season. First and foremost we had solid shipments in the quarter. This included a successful UAN fill program, along with 780,000 tons of UAN and urea exports combined. These efforts kept our plants running at full rates and allowed us to capture international sales when domestic customers were unwilling to take a position. We also built a strong book of business into the fourth quarter as customers accepted that significantly lower nitrogen prices were unlikely.","This includes shipments from our UAN fill program, which will continue well into the fourth quarter. As a result, we are very happy with our position across our network, and have the flexibility to capitalize on market conditions in the spring. Looking ahead, we believe there is substantial support for the current price environment.","During the third quarter, higher LNG and natural gas prices in Asia and Europe caused marginal producers in those regions to curtail production significantly. In fact, reported global urea outages, not including China, affected approximately 5 million metric tons of nameplate capacity, the highest for any quarter that we have on record. We believe the winter heating season will likely keep natural gas and LNG costs high for producers in Asia and Europe.","China's declining role in global urea trade also contributed to higher global prices. Through August 2018, China exported less than 1 million metric tons of urea, a 72% decrease from the same period last year due to the high cost of feedstock and rigorous enforcement of environmental regulations.","Additionally, the market is still absorbing the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran. In the short-term, it appears that Iran will have fewer destinations for its exports, which could limit their participation in the global market and further reduce supply. The global nitrogen supply may be lower than many expected, demand in the short to mid-term maybe stronger. We project 93 million acres of corn to be planted in the United States, which is about 4 million more acres than 2018.","This should support a good fall ammonia season. Ammonia represents a solid value to growers, and with a favorable corn to bean ratio, we expect growers to apply ammonia if weather conditions allow. Otherwise, we expect greater demand for upgraded products in the spring as farmers try to maximize yield.","Additionally, industry observers think that India will tender 1 to 2 times before March and large nitrogen consuming regions such as Brazil and Europe still have to catch up on purchases. Overall, we believe this leaves CF in a very strong position through the first half of 2019, and we are looking forward to the opportunities ahead.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the third quarter of 2018, the company reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.13, EBITDA of $308 million and adjusted EBITDA of $300 million. During the quarter, we added $294 million of cash to the balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1 billion as of September 30. At the end of October, our cash and cash equivalents balance was around $1.1 billion even after having invested approximately $150 million to repurchase about 3 million shares of common stock.","Capital expenditures in the third quarter were approximately $130 million, as turnaround and maintenance activity increased. Looking ahead at the balance of 2018, we still have significant turnaround and maintenance activity ongoing. As a result, we expect our capital expenditures to total approximately $425 million for activities this year.","Given the favorable trading conditions in the global nitrogen market, we expect that fourth quarter results will significantly exceed those of the same period last year. Longer term, as the cyclical nitrogen recovery continues, we expect to generate substantial amounts of cash available for deployment.","All of this has been enabled by excellent operational performance and an improving world marketplace. As Tony indicated earlier, we expect North American natural gas to remain plentiful and low cost compared to the rest of the world. Our view is reinforced by the multi-year decline we have seen in overall oil and gas upstream investment globally.","From 2016 to the current year, overall upstream investment on an annual basis is down roughly 40% compared to 2014 according to the International Energy Agency. Although global oil production of around 100 million barrels per day has kept up with growth in demand, it has done so by cutting into spare capacity, which is down to only 2% of daily global production and declining.","Exploration activity has been drastically reduced. Conventional oil and gas discovery volumes in 2017 reached an historic low of 6.8 billion barrels of oil equivalent, just 25% of the 2000 through 2015 annual average. This likely means that there will be fewer major greenfield development projects in the future. Similarly, from 2015 through 2017, greenfield project investment itself fell dramatically with the volume of conventional resources sanctioned dropping roughly 50%.","Some of this capital has been redirected towards already producing areas so-called brownfield assets, which has helped to stem base production decline, but much of this investment does not address the longer term need to supply growing demand. On the downstream side, LNG liquefaction investment is down significantly as can be seen on slide 14. Although the market will still need to absorb fully, the capacity increases of recent years, significant increases in LNG imports, particularly in China, will lead to \u2013 will likely lead to a tightening supply and demand balance post 2020.","Lastly, as can be seen on slide 14, China has been aggressively reducing investment in new coal production. This trend underpins our belief that it is likely China's nitrogen industry will remain a much smaller participant in the global nitrogen marketplace driven by higher input costs and governmental efforts to burn less coal.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move on to your questions, I want to recognize our employees for their outstanding work. They continue to execute our business exceptionally well. In the past 12 months, a highly volatile period that included very low prices, our employees remained focused on operational excellence, and as a result, we're able to generate nearly $900 million in free cash flow over that time.","Our focus on disciplined capital stewardship enabled us to deploy that cash generation along with cash from our balance sheet to create value for our shareholders by accomplishing all of the following. We retired $1.1 billion in high interest debt, paid $280 million in dividends to our stockholders, invested in additional North American production by repurchasing the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company for $388 million, repurchased $90 million worth of our shares, and still ended this quarter with more than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","As we look ahead, we are even more excited about the future, because we expect the following factors will only further enhance our business results. The continued tightening of the global nitrogen supply and demand balance, higher energy costs in Europe and Asia with continued low natural gas cost in North America, and because higher energy costs and environmental enforcement actions have effectively removed China from global urea export participation. Our focus, capabilities and asset base positions us exceptionally well for the years ahead.","With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. You may begin.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a question or two of unrelated pieces, please. The first one just, could you talk about the outlook for the UK business given the gas outlook? I mean, is there opportunities potentially to start redirecting ammonia from the U.S. Gulf to the UK, improve your cost position in Europe?","And then second, balance sheet wise, you ended the quarter with about $1 billion of cash. You've got the $500 million bonds left to repay, and you've targeted $300 million to $500 million of targeted cash on hand for the balance sheet. Should we think of any excess cash moving forward really going to share repurchase in the absence of any strategic opportunities that emerge?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Adam. I'll handle the UK bit, and then hand it over to Dennis for the cash piece. On the U.S., we have purchased some spot ammonia cargos. Economically, it's a little bit better for us just to export straight out of D'ville (00:15:06) as opposed to try to move it over into the UK operation and then buy into the UK, just from standard global trading positions of ammonia as opposed to move diesel production over there. But we have moved some ammonia into the UK operations periodically, and been able to benefit based on where the spikiness in gas was in the UK this year.","I will say that there's a fair bit of our industrial business over there. It's actually indexed back to gas. So when gas price goes up, we pass a lot of that through. That's not as true on the AN side for the Ag marketplace. But AN pricing has been kind of keeping up reasonably well, and been tied pretty closely to what's going on with European gas cost.","So, it's a weird \u2013 a little bit of a weird situation. We're making okay money over there. But in fact, when the gas cost in Europe is real high, and we're only making okay money over there, it creates a huge opportunity for our U.S. asset base. So in some ways, it's a little bit of a natural hedge.","And on the cash on the balance sheet, capital deployment, I'll hand it over Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, our capital deployment strategy is unchanged which is, first and foremost what we like to do is invest excess cash in our business, and our strategic fairway is to see if we can generate returns in excess of our cost of capital, and do something that is incremental on our cash flow per share basis accretive if you will to our base business plan. So that's how it's going to be our preference.","Having said that though, there're not an infinite number of opportunities to do that. In the current environment, we certainly don't want to be investing in building new plants, because assets trade on Wall Street at a significant discount replacement costs. Now, if you look at the inorganic side, there has to be something for sale to buy that we want to buy that's actually going to be accretive, and there's not an infinite number of those opportunities out there.","So, I'd say is, in keeping with our share \u2013 at our capital allocation strategy, we want to return excess cash that we don't need for the business to the shareholders. We have been biased in the past and currently towards share repurchases, because we believe that the share price today greatly undervalues the business. And I think that that's something \u2013 that philosophy is unchanged as we go forward into the future.","What I would point out is that just with the 3 million shares that we bought leading up to October 31, that we've already created over 1% accretion to our shareholders, and as time goes by those \u2013 that gets bigger. And so when you think about accretion to our base business plan, it has to be something really, really attractive.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","For us to do something different.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Do something else.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. You may begin.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Just two quick ones. You talked about not wanting to invest in new plants, because assets traded at discount to replacement cost, but what environment do you need to see in the U.S. for investment to start building for new capacity? We've seen Methanex start to talk about a new methanol plant, and of course the commodities are different. But in some sense, the economics are somewhat similar.","And then my second question is on your cash conversion cycle. I've noticed over the last couple of years it's been changing quite a bit in terms of your accounts payable being due a lot more quicker than in the past. Can you just talk about both of those?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","On the kind of what you'd need to see to add new capacity over here? We've done a fair bit of analysis on kind of the return profile required at least for us to think about adding new capacity. And basically the problem over here is that for the most part it's difficult to get fixed price labor contracts or LSTK kind of bids that are anywhere close to being reasonable. And so you're facing a real uncertain construction costs profile out there, and every single project that has been executed in North America has run over, particularly in the area of labor cost, because productivity has been particularly poor.","And when you are increasing the cost profile of a project by about $250 million of capital, that's sort of equivalent to $2 of MMBtu benefits you have to gain in order to pay for it over the life of a project. So, if you can do a fixed price contract in other places in the world that have $5 or $6 gas, generally speaking, you're going to do better from an economics return standpoint than you are by building projects in North America. So, I have a hard time believing that it would make sense for anybody to build over here just given how difficult the labor market is.","And in particular, if you look at the amount of both ethylene and methanol or ethylene cracker and methanol projects that have been announced, the war for skilled labor is getting increasingly more challenging, which just drives up construction costs even farther. And based on the tariff regimes that are in place right now, certain of the exotic steels that you have to bring in from offshore are also fairly expensive.","So, when we look at building in in North America, we think it's a little bit of a fool's game to try to do that. There's other parts of the world where it makes a lot more sense. And then, on the working cap piece, I mean, I think we're running at negative.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I think we've \u2013 I mean, the way I look at it is, I don't think that we're selling our products under different terms to people from the accounts receivable perspective. We had \u2013 back when we were doing the expansion projects, we had higher accounts payable obviously, because you had a lot of money going out the door to pay for the expansion.","But in addition to that, what I would note is, you probably have seen that on cash flow statement. The delta in customer advances is very significant this quarter compared to what it was last year. And what that reflects really is, we think a growing confidence on the buyer side in the price deck for nitrogen going forward. And so that's a very healthy development for us. There was a point in time in this cycle where we weren't sure that customer advances would ever come back, and they've actually come back quite significantly. So we're basically a negative working capital type company. And I think, that will be with us at least for some time given where we are in the cycle.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. You may begin.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. In terms of your just asset base, can you just walk us through some initial thoughts on 2019, including just your projected operates versus 2018? Any changes in product mix, as well as the preliminary acreage outlook. And when you think about North American nat gas, what are your current thoughts on the AECO and Mid-Con basis? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, good morning, Chris. So we have more turnaround activity in 2018 than we had in 2017 or 2019. So I would expect, year-to-date, I think we're down a couple of percentage points versus last year. I'd expect that to return kind of back to normal, but that's sort of more on the margin, so a little bit more production.","In terms of our product mix, Bert really makes that decision on the fly, and it has to do with, are we better off having incremental granular in hydrous or are we better off having the incremental UAN. And so he looks at kind of what the pricing realization is, what the inventory positions are, what the demand is. And at the end of the day, a netback margin decision on how to optimize kind of the \u2013 or maximize the company.","So we have ranges of kind of what we produce. And I'd say somewhere between 7 million and 8.5 million tons of UAN is probably where we're producing, and the specific of where we land is highly determined by margin in any given period of time. But given that production profile or sales profile for the year, that means we're producing and shipping, call it, on average about 700,000 tons of UAN every month. And we only have about \u2013 from a working inventory standpoint, about a month, maybe six weeks of usable production during that period of time. So we really need to be consistent producers and sellers as we move along, because you don't have the option, given how big we are, just to step back from the market for extended period of time, at least with respect to the UAN.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","With respect to the differentials, Mid-Con and also for Alberta, those closing up is going to be a function of how fast the evacuation capacity comes on versus how much production capacity they develop. So if you look at the forward curves at least in the Mid-Con, I think it's two years out or so, three years out, maybe you see a drop off in that \u2013 those differentials.","With respect to Alberta, Shell has announced, I think, about a $31 billion LNG project in British Columbia. But that's going to take a very long time to build. $31 billion, it takes a long time to spend that on a single project.","So I think the Alberta differentials are going to be with us for quite some time. I suspect that the Mid-Con differentials will stretch out just because even as you build out evacuation capacity, there are times when the prices are right, the development of additional production capacity exceeds that, so we'll have to see how that develops. But right now it's a good dynamic.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrne from Bank of America. You may begin.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Were any of the lower volumes that you had shipments in the third quarter actually intentional? Where you were holding back on perhaps selling some refill product? And then had a question about the slide 11 that shows actually declining demand in China. To what do you attribute that to?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Steve. So, relative to third quarter, I think our ammonia production was darn close to where we were last year, it was basically flat. And if you look at our inventory from the standpoint of where we said we're $50 million lighter in terms of our inventory from a balance sheet perspective, than where we ended Q3 of last year. And given that gas cost is lower and we're putting inventory in it, with the cost of production, that's quite a bit lower from a tonnage standpoint.","So, we have kind of been able to maintain our volumes for the year, despite being a little bit lower on production, because of turnarounds by squeezing inventory. So, I wouldn't say that we did a lot of holding back, and in fact, that's kind of what has positioned us so well for the go-forward, which is we have a lot of inventory space that enables Bert to kind of think about when we want to make sales, and when we want to go ahead and take the foot off the accelerator.","And I don't remember what the second...","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","On the second question regarding Chinese consumption, we have seen some variability over the last five years ranging from let's say 53 million tons of consumption up to 57 million tons of consumption, some of that's economically driven in terms of industries, because it's a very large percentage of their consumption is used in industrial applications, as well as we believe just declining end base a little I'd say steady end-based consumption for the crops.","So, on an overall basis it's like a \u2013 when you look at over last year, it's actually up 2%. And so I don't see that much of a decline.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But I think part of it, Steve, is the central government has come out with this strong position saying kind of net flat urea consumption through 2020. And what you're seeing here is, I think in response to some of those initiatives actually taking root. So, we don't think that there's some big drop off coming. We think that a lot of that has already been socialized and implemented in China. And so from here going forward, we think there's a fair bit of industrial demand growth still remaining there, and that's what gives us a fair bit of confidence about what the demand side looks like going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. You may begin.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Bert, what percentage of your third quarter volume was at summer fill prices? Just trying to get a sense of the price momentum as we go into Q4 and next year? And how much of this September-October run-up in nitrogen prices that you'll realize in the fourth quarter. And I noticed you had about $313 million of customer advances. What \u2013 were these at the old summer fill prices or this is at the new higher prices?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, when you look at the summer program I'd say Q3, you're rolling out of Q2 heavy demand into Q3 very low or non-existent demand. So you are incenting customers to purchase products that they will store for a period of time, and could be until spring. And so, we launched the UAN fill program the second week of July. And as that rolled out, and then shipments began rolling out in later July. So, a majority, all of Q3 UAN volume was a part of the fill program, and as I mentioned, some of that will also well into Q4 we'll be shipping \u2013 continue to ship on.","For urea, when you look at, we were rolling out of a weak pricing period in the low 200s, and then we booked several exports early in let's say July and some in late June for Q3 as well as some programs for moving Midwestern product, and those tons shipped through the quarter, and we look at urea being more market based in Q4. And then for ammonia, a lot of the fall demand that's being shipped today, some of that was booked in Q3, and some of that will be booked in spot. And then when you look to Q1, we're wide open for 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. You may begin.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Thanks. I had two questions. Actually, I want to follow-up on that last question. Bert, we've obviously seen some of your competitors look at doing less fill in the past. Is that something as you've looked at this summer's fill program, you could \u2013 CF could also look at doing maybe not really doing fill doing more of a month-by-month or does your storage not allow you to do that?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Morning, Joel. I'll jump in first, and I'll turn it over to Bert. I think going back to what I said earlier, we're producing about and meeting the ship about 700,000 tons of UAN a month, and I think if you're a bit of a smaller niche player, you probably have some opportunities to not be in the market every day, and to pick and choose timing. So, I would expect those people should be able to get on average better price realization over the course of the year, because you can pick and choose your timing a little better. Because of just the scale of this business, it's pretty hard to take a month off and say, no, we're not going to be there.","And what we found when Bert launched fill is that there was pretty strong appetite. And so we were able to kind of build a bit of a book, and then that's what helped us take prices off was the fact that there was such a demand increase.","So, I think it's \u2013 part of the recent demand rises in this kind of environment is because of the actions that Bert and his team have taken. So we don't really have the option of not being out there just given our size and our scale. But Bert, do you want to...","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I look at it in terms of the optionality available to the company, and what is going on. There are several factors that drive our decisions being global demand, domestic demand, this is new international market. And we're constantly monitoring what's going on globally on the Ns, UAN, urea, ammonia. And so we're taking decisions that obviously are driven by profitability. So if we believe in terms of the gas costs and the structure available to us, it's a profitable decision, we will do a fill program. However, if we believe that it's not attractive to us, we won't do a program to the same degree, which you saw in 2016.","And so when you look at the options available to the company exports, distribution, product mix, making more urea and ammonia and less UAN or vice versa, mode of shipment, vessel, barge, a truck or rail, we're weighing all of those. And then the pricing \u2013 laying the pricing over top, and we work together as a team to make that decision and discuss with the management team and then we execute, and we feel very positive about our position today and especially our position going into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. You may begin.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to get a sense for some of the proposed European anti-dumping duties on UAN, and how that might impact global trade flows, and if they put restrictions on Trinidad, Russia and North America. Do you see a change in European nitrogen consumption habits? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Mike. So the big issue around the EU Commission is, this is largely I would say an effort that was brought forward by the Eastern European producers. So you've got the Poles and Romanians and Lithuanians. And the challenge for them is they're paying near $10 per MMBtu gas, and then they're not even producing in the region of consumption. So they've got a fair bit of logistics cost to get much of that product over to France and Belgium, and so forth.","And frankly they're losing money like crazy, and they can't run and so they turn to the EU Commission to looking for support. And for us, I think, we sell less of our product over there than a couple of percent in aggregate. And I think it's less than 1% of our profits. So it's not really material for us if we end up having to shift where we ship that product. The bigger issue is this is really bad news for EU farmers, because what it's going to do is, it's going to jack-up pricing on what they view as their most effective form of nitrogen.","And as a result, the other products are going to fall in line, you're going to see increases, not only in UAN, but also in in AN, CAN and urea, that are going to be going into Europe. And so, European farmers are the ones that ultimately are going to feel the real sting of where this all shakes out at the end of the day. And one of the things the Bert and his team have done a tremendous job of is developing relationships in outlets and demand for us in Latin America. And so, it's just as easy for us to send our UAN into Latin America as it is to send over to France and Belgium.","And so I would just expect there to be some subtle movements in terms of where kind of the product flows. But at the end of the day, it's pretty non-material for us, the people that are really going to lose here are the EU farmers.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. You may begin.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning everyone. Tony, you talked about sort of the greenfield opportunity and the labor issues. I'm just wondering what maybe the brownfield opportunities are within the company, and I'm thinking in particular to the two new facilities you constructed typically, new facilities have some capability to expand, is that not attractive, and just as an aside to that, I did read something about some expansion in Medicine Hat, just a headline, so if you could maybe fill it in as well. Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes, good morning, Vincent. The new plants are running extraordinarily well. Chris and his team have them running at about 20% over original nameplate which is absolutely astounding. It's kind of we built two plants and ended up with three almost. And \u2013 so they're already kind of really firing on all cylinders. There may be some incremental opportunities to enhance them a little bit, but those are relatively smaller. And as we look at kind of the cost and challenges of moving anhydrous around, that was really what was making us think about Medicine Hat from the standpoint of incremental investment.","We've got two ammonia plants out there, only one urea plant were very long ammonia and the rail rates are challenging up there. And so, we've been looking at, do \u2013 is there an upgrade plant or something else that can be done up there, because you're dealing with AECO gas that's some of the cheapest gas in the world, and that was part of why Bert and his team signed the deal with J. R. Simplot Company that be able to export through their Portland Terminal, so we get good margin realization out of that production.","As we've looked at Canada, the Trudeau government and some of their carbon backstop legislation makes it really challenging for us to want to put any kind of new capital up there right now, because I think they're doing things that are really anti-business and make it very difficult for us to want to spend money in that particular area.","So I think we've looked at it a bunch of times. It's difficult because of labor costs up there and some of the governmental actions, and creativity of Bert and his team in terms of finding alternative outlets means that we've got really good solutions. So it's something we continue to think about, but we're not thinking about it actively, if that makes sense.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning. So just regarding the cost curve that you guys put out, I like how you show that the demand has this monthly volatility. I was just curious on the cost curve, and I understand it's a little bit complex to show the volatility, seasonality on a single slide. But could you maybe just talk about your view on the seasonal changes in the cost curve that you could see coming out?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","When you look at the cost curve and what's going on, how we follow it is we're constantly engaged in different growing regions of the world, South America, Australia, India or Asia, Europe, North America, not much is happening in Africa, although we would like to see that to take place over the next couple of years.","But when you look at the seasonal variability, it really is a North\/South, except when you extrapolate out crop changes, whether that's corn and what's going on in South America today with the tariffs, and extreme probably growth possibility of soybeans in Argentina and Brazil, you could see some changes there on demand mix. But that drives kind of how that cost curve in shipment rates and demand and pull rates and application rates then drive that seasonability.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew, I'd like to make two other points, which is if you look at the cost curve, what you see is that \u2013 in that yellow band, that's kind of our estimate, what you see that, I'm going to call it volatility it's a variability seasonally. And if you look to the left of that, what you see is that there's a very flat shelf from where it sits. So even if it moves to the left significantly, you don't really get a significant downshift in price.","The other point that I would make is with respect to the width of the bars themselves, we make rather conservative assumption that installed nameplates capacity runs at about 95% of capacity. And so if that were to contract significantly, really anywhere in the middle of the cost curve, what that would do is, to the degree we had seasonal variability above the cost curve or even below, what you're going to have to do is be bidding in the higher cost tons, more of the higher cost tons to the right on the cost curve. So there's fairly conservative view of sort of what price outcomes would likely be in a supply driven, cost curve driven marketplace.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other thing Andrew that I'd just add on that is, this is a static view of 2019 based on where things from an input standpoint sit as of today, right. So if you see a dramatic change in Brent crude or China coal or even exchange rates, all of those things start having an impact in terms of the shape of that curve, and those things evolve over time.","But as we sit here today and as we look forward, and as we've kind of taking a look at what the forward energy curves look like, and the freight markets and so forth. This is sort of our best estimate of what the year will look like, although there's a lot of volatility out there, so things do shift. We don't tend to update this on a regular basis just because it moves all over the place. So this is meant to be directional what we expect to happen with a fair bit of volatility around it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens, Inc. You may begin.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. We've clearly seen fall ammonia application rates in the U.S. dropped sort of on a secular basis. So when you say that you're expecting a pick-up in fall application, do you see that as a shift from that long-term trend, or is that just a response to the increased acres?","And then second question let me start on now, notwithstanding your earlier comments on buybacks. So I was a little surprised to see your capital allocation slide referenced your dividend growth rate. With the dividend flat for three years, is that slide suggesting that raising the dividend is something you think is important?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I'll take the first question. Regarding fall ammonia applications, there are two drivers for fall application. Number one is weather. And so when you \u2013 and we've had some constrained seasons in the last couple of years in the fall, where either snow came early or wet and cold weather came early. Last year, we had a very good window that was opened into December. And so, there's that issue. The other is price and value to the farmer.","And so, what we've learned, I think, over the last, I'd say, five or so or maybe even longer years is you needs to be in an attractive value for the farmer to put down in the spring or in the fall, and we want to incent that. We want fall application of ammonia to continue, it's a good agronomic opportunity for the farmer. It leaves in the position to be able to quickly get into his field with his basic nitrogen needs fulfilled, and then can continue as they move with precision farming to variable applications in the spring, maybe some urea, some UAN to complement the fall application of ammonia.","We, at CF, we value that that pool on our system. Because, as Tony has mentioned, we produce 24\/7, 365, and we have our terminals throughout the Midwest to serve that business that were developed 40 or 50 years ago. We maintain them. We spend a lot of money, and we want those assets to be utilized and that product to go out a certain percentage of it in the fall. And so, I don't see a shift \u2013 actually I see a shift in trend probably returning to a higher level of fall application relative to today at $4 a corn for fall of 2019, that's attractive. The pricing that came out in Q3 and Q4 for a fall application is attractive, and we're seeing that product move to the ground today.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And Mark on the dividend growth rate, I don't think this slide has changed much in the last couple of years. So it's the same sort of slide with the same arrow on it that we've had, maybe with just an additional year tacked on.","And really let me talk a little bit about kind of our philosophy on the dividend, which is that there are a number of our shareholders, large institutions that value having the dividend and want to see that grow and need to have that in there for us to be in the portfolio. And as you look back through kind of 2012, 2013 into 2014 and 2015, we started increasing the dividend in order to try to maintain what I would call a more average yield from the standpoint of the S&P 500, so that we were not an outlier one way or another.","Now the unhappy consequence of the share price drop in 2015 and in through 2016 and 2017 is that the dividend yield look like it really blew out, although the dividend itself stayed the same amount. And now it's kind of coming back into a more normal range. And I would be delighted if we're in a place where our dividend looks meager by virtue of yield from the rest of the S&P 500, because it means our share price is back up where it belongs, and then we'll think about whether a more even handed approach between increasing dividend versus share repurchases make sense. But I think in the near-term back to Dennis' comments earlier, we view our shares as being a tremendous value right now, and that's kind of where our focus is.","Operator","Thank you. And next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. You may begin.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Your pricing outlook for 2019 is $260 to $310 which is flat to down from where we are today. That doesn't match up with your bullish outlook, and the cost curve that you mentioned. Can you just slice that out for us? And then secondly \u2013 sorry, go ahead and I'll ask my question later.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I was going to say look, a full year of $260 to $310 is above where this year has been so far. So, I think that is actually up year-on-year, and that's also sort of the floor cost. I think there's always back to Dennis' point, if you see demand developing, there's a point of view that there's a fair bit of catch-up demand that's got to show up in the Northern Hemisphere, both in terms of in Europe and North America.","And so, inventories are kind of light in the channel, and with India tendering another one or two times, you could see the demand-vertical bar on the supply curve move farther to the right, and all of a sudden, you could be well above that number and entering into a demand-driven marketplace. So, what we're not doing is projecting what the year is going to be. What we're saying is, this is what the economics tell us as of today. But you end up with a lot of variabilities that can drive different outcomes.","And then extrapolating that urea value to the other end values paints a pretty nice picture for 2019.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And then P.J., and I will just remind you what I said earlier which is that we assumed in these bars that the nameplate capacity for all of them runs at 95%, and obviously, you're well aware that that generally doesn't happen.","The other point I would add is, Iran is likely going to be out of the marketplace. So, this is really a cost of input situations, and not just sort of saying the price will therefore be within this range. It may well be, I'm not saying it won't. But I wouldn't say it necessarily ends up in that way.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But the last point, so year-to-date, our average urea selling price is, call it, $260, $259. So, the midpoint of that range ends up being at like $285, that's $25 ahead of where we are today. That's another $350 million of EBITDA. So, we're not unhappy about that forward view of the world.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. You answered my question. I was going to ask you if you're being conservative. But let me ask you this, you mentioned that you're unlikely to build a new plant. So, do you think \u2013 given your comment on buy versus build, do you think M&A is attractive and is that something you would consider and in which geographic regions? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think, as Dennis pointed out earlier from a philosophy standpoint, spare or excess capital we'd like to be able to deploy back into the business and grow. And the benefit of buying versus building is, it's \u2013 you get immediate cash flow, you maintain the S&D you're not subject to all the risks of cost overrun and everything else that go along with it. And so, I think from that standpoint, buying particularly when assets are trading below replacement cost makes a lot of sense.","For us who want to do it, though, back to Dennis' point, it's got to be clearly accretive versus our other alternatives. And our other alternatives are buying our shares back, at we believe a very attractive value.","So, we're \u2013 in some ways, there's more synergies if the plants would be North American based, because they would just tuck directly into our network and our system, and there's logistics and other efficiencies that come along with that. But we'd be open to facilities outside the U.S. if the value proposition was such that we believe we could make a risk-adjusted return that was in excess of alternative uses of that cash.","So, it's certainly something we're interested in, we're thinking about, but there's a relatively high hurdle that it's got to beat which is what else can we do with the capital, and right now, we can buy shares back at what we believe are pretty attractive prices.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. You may begin.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. If we can stay on that cost curve a little bit, you have Eastern Europe, Lithuania, Ukraine there on the right hand side. But in the history of urea, price has not once corresponded to the cost of these guys, right? So, they don't operate on price. They operate based on gas availability. That to me suggests that they're running flat out anyway. And so if we run into a shortage, shouldn't we blow right past them and into either the very high end of China intrasite or even into East Asia gas which is not on your cost curve, since it's a marginal producer?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Jonas, when you look at the cost curve and some of those countries that are in the far right side, and your point on they have operated, they have. They have domestic demand that is difficult to reach with some of the seaborne traded tons. When you look at this whole graph, what we're trying to present is where we think that price will trade of the seaborne traded ton and specifically to NOLA.","But you're right, the Gazprom priced gas that goes to some of these Eastern European producers in Croatia or Hungary or Romania, yes, they have some of their own gas, Poland, does place them as high cost producers. And by the way, some of those plants are the ones that took extended downtime that we identified in this 5 million tons so they do take downtime. There is times when they can't compete, they were $9 gas this summer with pricing at the $250 level, and so they took one, two and three months or even more down or we're buying spot ammonia as did the Poles this past quarter.","And so this is a fluid situation. Those were also older assets that we don't believe have been maintained as well. And so when you get into a difficult environment, it's difficult to make reinvestment or investment decisions for the future.","And that's why I think as part of harking back to a previous question on the EU dumping case, there was an issue that some of those producers that were part of the EU dumping case did not invest to make other products that are more demanded in Europe like calcium ammonium nitrate or other products that have a higher value.","And so there are several issues with that that drive specific to your question in those producers, but the cost curve is real, and we've seen it drive, you may get extraneous movements up and out or below like we saw on 2016 and 2017 in the summer, but then like this summer, we saw that move above and now that cost curve reflects $310, and we think there's a possibility that in 2019, it could go higher than that.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And Jonas, let me just tag on to the Bert's last comment there which is the last couple of years have been very difficult for the marginal producers globally. And so a lot of those plants have not been well maintained or the ones that have been offline for some period of time will have a very difficult time coming online with any sort of reasonable reliability.","And so, I think that's kind of embedded back into your question as if you see some seasonal volatility just to the high side in terms of demand, you could easily bust through the top end of that curve and kind of be in a runaway demand driven part of the cycle in the near term.","And honestly, that \u2013 there's a reasonable chance of that happening this year with the extra 4 million tons of corn acres increased with acres and so forth in the U.S. and the fact that there just is not a lot of excess material out there. So that doesn't suggest what could happen to the upside, it's just \u2013 that's what we think sort of the four conditions are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. You may begin.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Could you give us a sense of your geographic mix of sales for 2018 U.S. versus international? And then maybe break international into export versus your UK operations?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","When we look at the mix that we have, we're about a 20 million ton producer of all \u2013 including Trinidad in the UK and movement of those product ton basis. In 2018, we will probably export around 1.4 million tons of UAN and about 400,000 tons of urea, and on ammonia probably 200,000 tons, maybe a little above that. And so, that does not include Trinidad ammonia.","And so, when you look at what we do, you can just run that on an average, but we're not looking to the market \u2013 in terms of market-driven, we're price-driven and value-driven and profit-driven, we're not market share-driven. And so those numbers you can see as we see attractive places or attractive opportunities in North America, those tons could stay home or those tons can move abroad. And so, we liked what the export package brings to us in terms of the flexibility and optionality to the plants and to our mode options. And so we plan to continue to grow that if profitability is there.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then back on your global demand outlook on slide 11, do you think that India demand could stall out in the next year or so or even decline with the higher prices, and therefore greater subsidies they need? And their need to import from further away from Iran \u2013 than Iran?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, most of the Indian demand is basically for sub-susistance farming, a big piece of it is. And so, a reduction in major gen availability will lead directly to reduction in yields. And I think the one thing that the government does not want to have is a food crisis on (00:58:20). So, we do not see a reduction in the Indian consumption going forward.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We see growth. India is a huge planter and consumer of sugar, of wheat and end consuming crops, and they have grown in terms of their overall demand over the last several years has been positive, and those are the years when you go back to 2008, when urea was $500 to $900 a ton, their subsidy bill was $15 billion, if I remember correctly. So they have participated as the market has rolled up, they have continued to buy. There has been some announcements of new rebuilds of plants, but those were high cost plants that were shut down, because they were not competitive in previous years, so we don't know why they would be competitive today buying LNG at $10.","So we still see them as a good export destination market. Their imports have averaged between let's say, 6 million to 8 million tons over the last five years and production holding fairly steady at 24 million tons. So, there are 30 million to 32 million ton consumer of urea and that's the end that they do consume, they're not an ammonia or UAN market, and we see that steadily growing on that 1% to 2% growth rate that we've projected for the world.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Miner from Bloomberg Intelligence. You may begin","Jason Miner - Bloomberg Intelligence","Thank you. There's been a little buzz here about implementing E15 possibly. I wonder if you could talk about what you see as a possible impacts to nitrogen demand from that, and how you think those might unfold over time?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, we're positive, any movement of ethanol, I've told the team I would put it on my lawn if I could. But E15, the implement \u2013 probably, we're not going to see the impact of that until the summer months, and then as it rolls out and is available, but it is a positive, and it's a positive incremental gain on the consumption of ethanol. That as well as the exports when petroleum is above that $60 to $70 level and corn is around that $4 level, the ability to produce ethanol and export it to different countries even though China has cut that off, we're still seeing good growth and good demand externally. So the combination of E15 and exports is a nice boost for the ethanol business and that's about 50% of the grind today where you've got corn on feed, corn going to ethanol and then the remaining being exports, great sustainability for the demand for that product. And that's why we're seeing \u2013 when you're looking the corn to be in ratio, being positive, the extra juice has the ability to move that products. So if you're a farmer you're probably going to choose the insecurity with soybeans, you'll move more towards corn and that's why we're projecting at 93 million and possibly even 94 million acres of corn which is that incremental demand for nitrogen that as we're seeing is a positive movement for 2019.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer from Barclays. You may begin.","Sean Gilmartin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. This is actually Sean Gilmartin in on for Duffy this morning. Thanks for taking the question. Real quickly, I was hoping you could just walk through kind of your longer term view on Chinese urea exports and kind of the main factors that are underpinning that view. Obviously, I'm assuming that the environmental regulations are holding. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about there? And if that longer term view doesn't hold, what's gone wrong? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think if you look at what's going on with the reduction in coal production and really clamping down on some of the zombie industries and excess capacity, it's been fairly consistent in terms of the central government's approach. And urea is not a big employer of people, and it is a big environmental footprint from the standpoint of both particulate matter emissions as well as fresh water usage. And so, I think with the emphasis on trying to improve environmental quality, urea has got a big target on its back in terms of one of the worst industries One of the worst industries that allow access capacity to exist in.","Our belief that was counterbalancing that food security and access to self-sufficiency from a nutrient perspective is important. And so, we believe that they want to maintain a self-sufficient industry. But you can do that pretty readily at existing levels which is why we've said that our view going forward is there're probably about 1 million or maybe 2 million ton exporter a year, probably pretty consistent with what happened this year in 2018 which effectively reduces their impact on the global trade coming off of when they were almost 14 million.","So, this has been a tremendous benefit globally. And I think from our perspective, we don't see it coming back. Once these plants get turned off and are down for an extended period of time, and it's extraordinarily difficult to rebuild them.","The one thing that is kind of concerning to us is, when you end up with like the Trudeau Government in Canada with the greenhouse gas regulations that they've put in, it's entirely possible that you'll shut down very low cost, low emitting plants in the rest of the world, which will keep Chinese plants operating because the world needs that kind of production. And really what Canada thinks is being like think globally, act locally is absolutely backwards. They're doing something that's harming the global environment instead of helping it. But our hope is that the Chinese regulators will continue to focus on improving local environmental quality and that will take care of itself over time.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexandre Falcao from HSBC. You may begin.","Alexandre Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for the question. India has announced that they should become self-sufficient in five years in urea, no imports. How feasible you think that is? And I saw that in one of your slides you actually anticipate one of the plants in India to 2019, so is there any risk that this plan is probably delayed? That's the first question. Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We've been watching this in some of these plants are moving forward that were mothballed and when we went and visited as well as looked at pictures of what mothballed means in India it's abandoned and it's trees growing up in the plant. So it's a complete rebuild. Now obviously labor is cheaper in India and probably some costs are cheaper in India. But the net effect is you've got to operate these plants because it's the same technology worldwide and it's so many MMBtu of gas and then your operating costs.","And so when you're importing LNG at $10, you're starting effectively with the urea cost just for gas of $240, and let's say their cash costs are less. But it is difficult in an environment that we just demonstrated with our cost curve to stay profitable. And so this was the issue with these plants 10 years ago when they were shut down, they weren't \u2013 or even longer, they weren't profitable, and they still have to build the pipe \u2013 the gas pipelines and the infrastructure to receive the gas. And there are plants that were built the Methanex plant that was built in India probably six or seven years ago that still really hasn't operated full speed. And so countries can do what \u2013 and governments can do what they want, and subsidize what they want, and those conditions can occur or go on for a period. But it's difficult to fight the gravity of economics.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The plant that's projected currently to be coming on line in 2019 is Chambal. And Bert and I met with them. We were in India last. And my sense is that their own internal projection, I'd take the over probably on that one, but we are betting in. But the government's initial desire was to try to get all of these plants built by private funds and the amount of uptake on that has been close to zero I think the Chambal plant was that was the only one so far.","So as Bert said, it's always a risk. But if they're running them on $10 imported LNG, we're pretty happy if they actually run, because that means that with $2.80 gas in the U.S., we've got a pretty good spread there.","Operator","Thank you.

Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter 2017, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $272 million after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","The first quarter demonstrated the agility of the CF team and of our business model, as we had to contend with navigating the effects of changing buyer behavior and an uneven price environment. Through it all, the team performed exceptionally well, finding the best margin opportunities out there.","We produced and sold more tons than ever before. However, the record volumes were about more than just additional production capacity. They reflected how our people responded to a rapidly changing marketplace in order to capture the best opportunities available, whether those opportunities were in the strong early demand for ammonia and UAN that developed in Southern Plains or pivoting to expand our exports when the spring stalled and buyers held back.","Our manufacturing system is running extremely well, with our new plants performing better than we could have imagined. Donaldsonville Ammonia number 6, our new plant, is running above 4,000 tons per day, roughly 10% above nameplate, while the Port Neal ammonia plant is producing over 2,850 tons per day or 18% above nameplate, with more upside to go on both ammonia plants.","Both new urea plants are about 4,350 tons per day, 13% over nameplate, and the new acid\/UAN plant at Donaldsonville is over 6,000 tons per day of UAN, more than 20% above nameplate. All the tons that we produce above nameplate capacity, which at these rates equates to roughly 250,000 tons per year of ammonia, for example, are basically at variable cash costs only. Given the North American gas cost is among the lowest in the world, those incremental tons are highly profitable for us.","With our low cost structure and flexible network, we run our plants at maximum rates. Even when North American buyers pulled back, as the weather got cold and wet in late February and through March, our team took advantage of the options we have to export, options most of our domestic competitors don't have. And although netback pricing for exports typically isn't as strong as Corn Belt delivered pricing, if the North American buyers aren't buying, we have very cash positive options abroad.","In fact, despite record exports, if you compare our average realized pricing for the quarter with many of our competitors that have in-market production, I am really proud of what our team accomplished. They moved the tons, kept the plants running and realized good cash margins \u2013 so good, in fact, that the company returned to generating positive cash flow for the quarter.","We added $148 million to our cash balance during the first quarter, which stood at $1.3 billion as of March 31. However, that performance was against a backdrop of overall low global prices. As we look at producers in high-cost regions, we are seeing rational behavior in response to these current industry conditions. For example, we have seen reductions in Ukrainian urea operating rates and recently announced curtailments of ammonia production there as well.","Chinese producers have reduced operating rates and exports due to the low global price environment. Reported Chinese operating rates for the first quarter remained below 60%. While there were roughly 9 million metric tons of capacity shut down permanently in China last year, an additional 7 million metric tons has also been idle. A majority of those plants have been idle for many months and are not currently running despite local Chinese spring demand. We believe this increases the probability that a substantial portion of these plants will not restart. This low level of Chinese production is evident in reduced export activity, as shown on pages 13 and 14 of our accompanying slides.","According to industry sources, Chinese urea exports were 1.2 million metric tons during the first quarter compared to 3 million metric tons during the first quarter of 2016. We continue to expect 5 million to 6 million metric tons of exports from China for the full year 2017, which is down significantly from recent years.","At the same time, the number of new capacity expansion projects being initiated around the globe has slowed dramatically. We continue to project the rate of net new capacity growth after this year and for the foreseeable future to be well below the normal annual demand growth rate of 2%, as is illustrated on pages 15 through 18 of our materials. Therefore, we expect the global supply and demand balance to tighten over the next few years, leading to industry recovery.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk about the market environment in more detail. Then Dennis will discuss our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Our operational performance during the first quarter showed how well we have prepared for the environment the nitrogen industry faces today. Over the past year, customers have resisted taking position and are increasingly delaying purchases until the last minute. As a supplier, we have to be ready to meet demand when and where it develops. Our operational advantages enabled CF to do that exceptionally well during the first quarter, as early strong demand emerged in parts of North America.","Warm and dry weather allowed the Southern and Southwest regions to be very active in applying ammonia during the first quarter. Our Oklahoma plants ran very well. Shipments for January and February were more than double the four year average.","We also shipped a significant volume of UAN during the quarter because of early demand. The wet and cold weather that appeared in the Midwest in mid-March slowed applications and purchases by our customers, leaving significant nitrogen demand to be filled through the rest of the application season.","Additionally, given the approximately 90 million acres of corn expected to be planted in the U.S. this year, we anticipate strong demand for upgraded products in order to make up for the lack of fall and early spring ammonia applications.","Even with the unfavorable weather at the end of the quarter, our ammonia sales volume grew by 25% over the first quarter of 2016. Urea and UAN applications did not begin in earnest during the first quarter, but we sold record amounts into the channel as our customers prepared for spring.","Sales volume for urea was 4% higher than last year, while we grew our UAN volume 27%. The average selling price for each product improved over fourth quarter 2016 results, but was lower than the first quarter of 2016. Ammonia prices rose steadily from the middle of the fourth quarter through the end of March due to healthy industrial demand and operational issues at several locations around the globe that kept supply tight.","Urea prices, and to a lesser extent UAN, followed a very different path through the quarter. NOLA barge prices for urea were below $200 a ton in the middle of the fourth quarter rose to about $250 a ton at the end of January and then fell back below $200 in March.","Global nitrogen prices are responding to the capacity increases of the past few years, anticipated increases this year and changing buyer behavior. We believe the rising prices we saw in the U.S. in January and early February attracted imports to the United States. This was exacerbated by a lack of other export destinations such as India, which do not have a tender for several months prior to April.","When import vessels arrived in the U.S. Gulf during the back half of the first quarter and beginning of the second quarter, North American customers resisted taking spot positions ahead of spring application. Prices fell in response and are now at a point that should dissuade exports to the United States.","In North America, additional capacity will be coming online over the next year. We believe the North American capacity additions at Wever, Enid and Borger will not ramp up quickly enough to have significant sales this spring season, but will likely impact the remainder of the year.","It will take time for the global nitrogen market to adjust to all the changes that we have seen in the past few years and settling to new trade flow patterns. The flexibility CF has built into our manufacturing, distribution, and logistics system gives us confidence in our ability to optimize the business, no matter the external environment.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert.","In the first quarter of 2017, the company reported a net loss per diluted share of $0.10 and EBITDA of $218 million. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $272 million and our adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.05.","For the first quarter, our largest adjustment was a $53 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives. Interest expense was $80 million, which we expect to be our quarterly run rate until we pay down the notes due in May 2018, after which it should drop to approximately $66 million per quarter.","Depreciation and amortization expense was $205 million for the first quarter of 2017, up from $146 million in the first quarter of 2016. We expect full year 2017 D&A to be approximately $875 million. The higher D&A has also impacted gross margin per ton for all of the applicable segments.","To help you compare the gross margins in the first quarter to prior periods, we have added information to the segment tables in the press release and a chart on slide 10 in the presentation. In this tables and charts, we adjust depreciation and amortization and unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on natural gas derivatives from gross margin as reported to show an adjusted gross margin. We believe this will give you a better sense of the underlying cash generation capability of each segment.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $148 million of cash during the quarter and our cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet rose to $1.3 billion as of March 31. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $94 million. For the year, we expect to spend approximately $400 million to $450 million for sustaining and other new activities.","Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, approximately $183 million remains accrued but unpaid related to capacity expansion activities in 2016. Most of this unpaid amount is the subject of disputes with certain contractors and vendors and it is too soon to estimate the timing or final resolution of these matters.","We will continue our prudent approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018. The 2018 debt retirement will be funded by the federal and state tax refunds of approximately $800 million we fully expect to receive in the third quarter of 2017.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their hard work this quarter. I've highlighted how well our team executed the business, but most importantly, we did it safely.","Our rolling 12-month recordable injury rate at the end of the quarter was 1.13, which is well below industry benchmarks. I particularly want to recognize our team at Verdigris, Oklahoma, who recently achieved 1 million safe hours without a recordable injury.","CF structural advantages, our access to low cost North American gas, operating in import-dependent North America and the long-term demand growth for nitrogen are enduring. Our operational advantages, scale, production flexibility, extensive in-region distribution network and export optionality set us apart from other producers. Taken together, they position CF to benefit disproportionately from the cyclical recovery we believe will begin to take shape in 2018.","With that, operator, we will now open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. As a courtesy to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to two questions.","Should you have additional questions, we ask that you re-enter the queue. We will answer additional questions as time allows. For our first question, we have Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, maybe to begin, Tony, Bert, maybe I'll talk about the market environment a little bit, as you think about the spring and how the market has evolved quite rapidly and changed in maybe March and April with where we are today, and as you think about market premiums to be realized in the second quarter. Can you talk about maybe the lack of the need of in-season application for urea, UAN? And how that might influence realized market premiums for your product in the second quarter versus the first, which obviously had a lot of export tons that start to move offshore as the market slows late in the quarter?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Adam. This is Bert. And you're right, this has been a strange evolving market, and every spring is, whether it came early in 2012 when we had record applications of ammonia to the wet and cold February and March that we saw this year, which then delayed applications. And so, we're still working to get product through the system. I think ammonia is going to be challenged for the next probably next couple of week and we'll move a lot to side-dress. And so, you're going to see probably additional tons needed of UAN and urea to backfill for top-dress applications of those products.","And so, the premiums in the market, we believe we're still holding. You're seeing premiums over NOLA, which is a freight calculation as you move up and through, and you're seeing the N premiums hold for UAN, urea has fallen quite a bit from the highs of early March. And I think you're going to see that value probably improve a little bit. As we move and applications begin, you're going to see probably some needs to move product around. And so \u2013 I didn't get your question on the lack of applications. What was that referring to?","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, it's just how the move to position product offshore later in the first quarter might have impacted your realizations versus benchmarks maybe relative to your expectations on the fourth quarter earnings call in mid-February?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. There's no question that the volume of imports that came in, coupled with the increased capacity that's come online in North America, our own, overwhelmed the market. And that product came in just when the cold weather hit, delaying applications, backing up product in the system, and I think a lot of our customers had position limits and were unable or unwilling to purchase pushing pricing lower to a point where we're at, I would say, below many of the higher cost producers in the world that exported product to the United States.","And so, we're in a strange environment where UAN and urea are almost trading at price parity and that has not occurred. And so imports we see already are decreasing and have to in order to balance the market and bring back probably rational or normal price structures.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And maybe just a follow-up on China, and this goes to maybe the demand growth that you've seen. I mean, you look at the Chinese production and export rates year-to-date, applied some pretty significant declines and year-on-year off-take domestically in China, coupled with, I mean, what's been the very slow Indian import level. Is there any worry on maybe that long-term nitrogen demand outlook of 2% or do you think this is a one year pause with inventory issues in the channel that maybe provide opportunities into 2018?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think looking at China, the numbers just did not add up and we've been working on that. We even added a couple of teams over there to try to bring on the ground information back and help us understand better. But, clearly, operating rates with demand don't \u2013 the numbers still don't work. So, inventory levels had to have been higher in China going into spring and those have been worked down. We believe the same thing happened in India, where they were able to stay out of the market for seven months using internal production as well as probably higher inventory levels.","And it looks like in many places around the globe that those inventories have been worked off and I think you're going to see a return to probably healthier or more ratable shipping patterns over the next couple months. But where we are today with the pricing level of urea was not expected, and that's going to have to force some decisions by higher cost producers to cease production, and you're seeing that in China today.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That's very helpful. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to talk about ammonium nitrate a bit. I mean, these contracts, I believe Orica and Nelson Brothers, were signed a few years ago. They (22:08) January 1. Can you talk about how your ammonia nitrate earnings are going to shift versus what we've seen the last few years? How will the volume play out across the year? How the contract's structured, where you can tell us \u2013 just to get an idea what they're benchmarked to, what they're indexed to, so we can figure out pricing? And then maybe give a little bit color about how ammonium nitrate prices are tracking in the U.S., but also in the U.K. where you have a lot of capacity? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So you've hit on a good segment for us. The contract did commence January 1. It's a 10-year contract. We've got a great relationship with the Orica Group and Nelson Brothers. They work together, moving our ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate solutions out of Yazoo City. We've revamped that plant to be a world-scale, very competitive plant with a lot of optionality around it with nitric acid, ammonia, UAN, and DEF that we also ship out of there.","But I think what you're seeing is the positive impact of that contract, which is a gas-based contract with a healthy margin for CF. It's an extension of the previous 10-year contract, which we believe gives viability to Yazoo City for the long term. And so what we did is then restructured the physical plant, moving from high agricultural ammonium nitrate to high industrial, and a much lower level of agricultural product, which allows that plant to run full speed 12 months of the year.","You also highlighted what's going on in the U.K., and we've got now almost a couple years of the U.K. operations tucked into our system. The person running that operation, David Hopkins, has done a great job of improving our average price realization. And so you're seeing that reflected both the U.K. operation and the Orica\/Nelson Brothers contract in the performance of the ammonium nitrate segment.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And the other thing that I would just highlight here, Joel, is one of the things that Dennis called out is we're including adjusted gross margin calculations on the segment reporting data and as well as the nutrient ton volumes that we're selling. And if you look at kind of the adjusted gross margin per nutrient ton, ammonium nitrate is actually the best product performing out of the major four products.","Now, our other segment is above that yet still because it contains DEF and other really high-value premium products, but we are really happy with our AN segment. It's performing very well. As Bert said, we're really pleased with working with Orica and Nelson Brothers and the new contract we have in place and with \u2013 it's a business that we like.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Joel, this is Dennis. The other point that I would make is if you look at the gross margin in the ammonium nitrate segment \u2013 and the comment that I'm about to make applies to all four of the major products, UAN, ammonia and urea and ammonium nitrate. If you look at cost of goods sold and you take out of the analysis realized gas costs and also depreciation, amortization and mark-to-market, what we see across the board is that we are getting greater efficiencies, as cost efficiencies on a per-ton basis for all of the four major products and we're seeing that kind of roll through to the results.","It's not so obvious. We're trying to \u2013 obviously, as Tony alluded to, we're showing adjusted gross margin. We're trying to shed a little bit more light on it, but it's actually very good story from a manufacturing efficiency perspective.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. That 5 million to 6 million ton export estimate out of China for urea this year, is that assuming that some of that roughly 8 million tons of capacity that you have a roster of temporarily shuttered capacity, is there an assumption there that some of that restarts this year and that 60% operating rate that they're running at actually moves up from here? And then just on that point, what would you say the delivered NOLA urea price would be that would be a breakeven for those anthracite producers?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So on the assumptions, Steve, that's embedded in there, look, we came out with a 5 million to 6 million tons last quarter's call as our estimate. The first quarter actual exports out of China was 1.2 million. Annualize that you're just below the low end of our range. So we expect there not to be a dramatic difference in terms of operating rates across China versus what's going on today. And that also, I guess, embedded in there is an assumption that says there's not a whole lot of dramatic upward price movement across the segments for the rest of the year because otherwise that would bid in some additional tons, which would then lead to more exports. So we're taking just pretty much of a almost status quo look at the world. Bert, do you want to talk about \u2013 ?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Today, based on our understanding of a lot of the build-up to the cost structure of the anthracite producer being feedstock costs and the changes in taxes, subsidies, et cetera, today, we'd land in NOLA on a short-ton basis in the $220 to $230 per short-ton.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, Bert, another one for you. What would you estimate the percentage of nitrogen tons in the U.S. that \u2013 out of the total amount that will be applied in 2017 and maybe some of it from the fall application, what percentage has already been applied and what's not been applied yet, how much have you sold?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, Steve, that's a tough question, because you're looking at planting rates today, we're about 10% behind, and looking at corn, we're probably, let's say, 34%, 35% and normal, at this time, is 44%, 45%, so we still have some additional acres that's been very wet. And I think there's going to be some replanting in some of these areas that got inundated with water, with rain, the last week or so. Wheat acres are down and cotton acres are up. And we're just getting that the cotton market season going in West Texas in that area. So that's a hard number to get.","So, we are positive on the net number \u2013 net volume of N and we've got that somewhere in our deck of staying fairly close to the previous years. It's just going to shift a little bit, again, like I said because of lower wheat acres and we believe higher canola acres up in Canada.","And so, we're positive of what's going on. And we do think from, say, I-90 North, you've got a lot of ammonia still to go. We had a very poor Canadian season in the fall and there's still some crops on the ground that need to be harvested up there. And so, we're just now seeing movement out of our Velva Terminal in North Dakota. It's got quite an extended period we believe and then it's going to go north into Canada.","Side-dress takes place in the Eastern Corn Belt, that still has to get moving here in the next, I'd say, couple of weeks that'll start, and then you'll get through the irrigation run. So, we've got a lot of applications still to go. We're still positive for Q2, but I can't give you a specific percentage on that.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. This is Ben Richardson sitting in for Don. On exports from Donaldsonville in 1Q, can you give us some information on that, both in absolute and relative terms?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sure. So, we exported a significant amount of product in Q1 as compared to last year and compared to our historical run rate. On ammonia, we exported to Belgium, Chile, Mexico, Morocco and South Korea for approximately 200,000 tons versus last year 2016, similar period, about 25,000 tons. That's a reflection of our Mosaic contract not coming into service yet. The contract is in place, but Mosaic is not pulling the volume that is contracted, and we've worked out an agreement around that, so we've been forced to be more active in the export market.","UAN we exported to Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, France, Ireland, Mexico and Peru, all in small volumes, whether that be from small containers all the way up into full vessels for a total of about 270,000 tons against last year 135,000 tons. We also exported some minor products into Mexico through some rail movement. So, total exports are close to 0.5 million tons for the quarter.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Just following up, would you expect that your export activity will increase in the back half as you ramp up?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That's a question of markets. We look at exports as we look at our whole book as a determination around profitability. And so each plant has its own configuration of logistics, whether that'd be pipe, truck, barge, rail, and Donaldsonville is the only one that can export by vessel.","And so, when we look at each one of those, there's cost associated, rail has become fairly expensive for any of our products and has not been as viable as it used to be. And so, when we look at what we do on the export market or even what we move to the coasts for Jones Act vessels, that's all determined on, again, price, inventory, optionality, and what the market is doing. If the U.S. market operates as it did last year and delays \u2013 purchases is not moving forward in a positive volume-wise until, then, yes, we will export more or we will produce more urea rather than UAN and move that, whether that be export or domestic.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Ben, one thing I want to highlight though is our plants are fully ramped up. I mean, there might be a little bit of topping that we can do on a few of them, but...","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Sure.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","... the plants are running full-on. So we're not anticipating dramatic deltas in terms of increased volumes. We're going to have to manage through it at D'ville or across the rest of the system.","Ben Richardson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Over the last few years, we've seen a compression of both marginal feedstock costs as well as transportation rates in various forms from key exporting ports, like (33:50) and Yantai, et cetera, adversely affecting delivered price in the U.S. When we think about your outlook in 2018 and 2019 and the composition of the global cost curve on a CFR basis, what's the best way to think about delivered prices to inland U.S. markets? I mean naturally, trade flows are going to evolve, but any insight on how you're thinking about your spreads and consequent margin per ton potential, would be helpful? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Chris. I'll give a little bit of this and then, I'll ask Bert and Dennis to chime in as well. One of the factors that actually is hurting us, and Bert was just bemoaning a bit, actually helps us in other ways, which is the fact that it becomes increasingly more expensive to move product by rail from the coast into the inland system that you have to use Jones Act vessels to move it from the coast up into the Midwest, and then in a lot of cases, then transport it to rail to move it elsewhere away from the river. Means that costs from NOLA into the interior only continues to get more expensive, which means the in-market plants get to enjoy kind of that premium. And as the data indicates, North America is going to be import dependent for the foreseeable future. We don't see that turning around. So, relative to the premium, we expect to get above NOLA. We think that continues to grow basically with the cost of transportation, which is roughly inflation-ish, in terms of what we've seen with our own contracts.","On a longer-term perspective, there is ongoing development of the LNG trade, whether it's Cheniere others here, other producers and origin points, that does have the effect that you're talking about, which is to flatten the hydrocarbon spread from one area to another, but a lot of those contracts continue to have at least $3 to $4 of delta in them off of Henry Hub. And so, the way we're kind of beginning to evolve our thinking is if you're in an oversupply situation on the supply side, so really supply constrained, then you're probably talking about landed hydrocarbon spread into other places of $3 to $4 and you got to move it back to the Gulf and up into the interior. And that gives you a sense of what the margin potential is for our interior plants.","If you're talking about a situation where nitrogen demand continues to grow above what new projects are, so you're more in a demand-driven environment, then you're really going to start bumping up against farm economics. They're going to drive the price in order to bid more and more and more expensive tons back into the system. So it kind of depends upon what part of the cycle you're on, but in either one of those areas we feel pretty comfortable about our business model going forward.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. And just you included a few slides on this, but clearly the Chinese are rationalizing some higher cost supply, mainly lump anthracite and few smaller inefficient thermal facilities, but they're also adding a few, let's say, more efficient thermal facilities, which should be arguably lower costs. When we think about the longer-term cost curve out of Yantai, as their own cost curve evolves and lower operating rates persist, I guess, in the near term, how should we think about their net export levels, but also more importantly, that cost of the marginal ton exiting China, let's say, two or three years out? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Chris, on that one, part of the issue also is the location of where those new efficient plants are getting built. So there's a number of them that are not really set up as being export-capable plants, particularly the ones in Inner Mongolia and so forth, cost to get to Yantai, is so extreme that you would never export those tons. So while it does change the overall balance in China, it doesn't necessarily bring the cheapest tons into the play from an export perspective.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And I think you have to have a perspective on the feedstocks, the different feedstocks. So, yes, we tend to talk about anthracite, and you mentioned the new thermal plants, but they are gas-constrained, and the winter gas limitations will continue to constrain operations of those gas-fired urea plants.","And so I think when you look at China and our numbers of 5 million to 6 million tons for this year, if I go out two to three years, we are in a process of rationalizing the globe. And that you saw it in the Ukraine, you're going to see in the few other countries. I think Brazil is having difficult times right now, not only for their gas cost but where those plants are operating and having to move the product that you're going to have to see some shutdowns \u2013 permanent shutdowns, and China still has more to go. And I think when you get \u2013 combined growth \u2013 historical growth pattern as well as that factor of taking product offline, then you're back into more of a demand-driven rather than a supply-driven market.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's very helpful. And thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Hey, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Your prior answer didn't mention coal prices in China and it seems like urea pricing is disconnected from coal now. So, was that just a short-term phenomenon that we experienced last fall and through the winter?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I think to the extent that you see a disconnect, it is a short-term issue. There's tons that get produced and are sitting in inventory and at port or in transit. So, to some extent, people are trying to monetize those and recover as much cash as they can because it's some cost they've already been produced. It's a very different story when it comes to replacing those tons from a supply standpoint. And what you've seen is a reduction all the way down to 1.2 million export out of China so far and no indication that it is getting more than that as we move forward, I think, is an indication that production rates and exports are really tied to coal cost and that there is some rational economic decision-making being taken place here.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But anthracite coal prices have not changed that much. Your mine average still remains around $135 per metric ton and so that is the cost, the high cost, that as you work that through, the calculation makes it impossible in today's market for that ton to make it out of China, and probably difficult to sell in China for a profit. So, Tony is right, some of that stuff that's at the port has been there for months and is probably degrading. So I think they're in a difficult situation in China.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other challenge, honestly, is, given the number of vessels that came this direction, the imports that we saw in Q1 with NOLA trading at a discount to other destination ports, you wouldn't see those tons show up here anyway.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then secondly, I guess there's some discussion about rolling back the ban on tax inversions? How do you think longer-term, strategically, about maybe the window opens and you have a chance to not be tax-domiciled here through some transaction versus the hope that longer-term U.S. rates stay low and it's just worth staying here because you have confidence they'll stay low long-term?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The White House also came out with a point of view of corporate taxes in 15% range. I mean, I think that's optimistic relative to what we're hearing being talked about at the House and Senate level. But a competitive corporate tax rate obviates the need for any kind of thinking about re-domiciling somewhere else. We love being a U.S. corporation. We want to stay here. We just hope the government gets it right and levels the playing field.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Your UAN per ton price was $171 and at least by my calculations, I thought the NOLA price averaged about $182 in the first quarter. So why would your UAN prices be about $10 a ton below NOLA, if that's a correct calculation?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I don't think that \u2013 I'd have to look at the average NOLA value, but you have to remember, the quarter's sales don't start January 1. We have a book coming into Q1 because we have a shipping program and logistical assets that need to move. So you're rolling into the quarter with a sales book and you're rolling out of the quarter with a sales book. So your average price is a blended price. And you remember, we started from lows of $130 in NOLA for the fill program and rose up to about $180. And then, you have logistical constraints. Like Tony mentioned, some of the rail rates just aren't that attractive and so that has an FOB limitation. And then you throw in some of our exports, which Tony mentioned are at a discount to NOLA, but we believe are the next best option for us.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And the other piece is, Jeff, as Bert has mentioned, when you got to take a Jones Act vessel to the East Coast or the West Coast, you're competing with Russian tons that are coming in. So although there's a referenced NOLA price, it's not that you can sell every ton that we produce at Donaldsonville at that price. The market isn't that deep, especially with our new UAN plant pumping out 6,000 tons a day. So we're doing over 13,000 tons a day...","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Out of D'ville.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","... out of D'ville alone and Bert's got to find a place to take those tons. So the ones that we move to the coast are not going to be at NOLA pricing on a netback basis, but they're still very cash flow positive for us.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And, secondly, you've indicated that the estimate for the partnership distribution for CHS was $35 million, though it's not yet declared. And your minority interest in the quarter, I think, was $6 million. In thinking about your adjusted EBITDA, shouldn't your adjusted EBITDA reflect the $35 million amount that's not yet been declared, or how should the payment to CHS be reflected in adjusted EBITDA?","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, the way we reflected in adjusted EBITDA basically is the way you would do it from an accounting perspective. What I would point out, though, Jeff, is if you think about the minority interest, $8 million for that (45:30) and $35 million, the $8 million reflects the share of U.S. GAAP income that is allocable from CFN to CHS. The distribution is based on a calculation pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement, which is intended to give both CHS and ourselves producer-like economics on the tons that we off-take. In their case, it's urea and UAN.","And so, the way I would think \u2013 I mean, you can come up with your own adjusted EBITDA calculation, I suppose. But we come up with it just according to the accounting numbers. But I think over time what you'll see is that those things tend to somewhat converge. If you want to have some more color on that, you can talk to Martin about it afterwards. He'll give you some data on that.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I'd like to follow up, actually, on the demand question. So, I mean, it feels like the demand has been wavering a little bit this year, and we've seen corn acreage cuts globally in places like China and the U.S.; nitrogen in general is overapplied in places like India and China, and nitrogen overapplication is an environmental concern as well. And we've seen in the U.S. and other places that yields can improve without big increases in nitrogen applications. So, I mean, first would be just what are your general thoughts on those kind of things I've raised? And maybe second is more of a detailed bottom-up approach on where you expect to see nitrogen demand growth longer term? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We can get into the philosophical side of N being overapplied. What you're seeing taking place in India, which gets a lot of commentary, you're actually coating \u2013 it's mandated, you have to urea treat in India, so you're getting much better efficiencies, but you're still at 30 million tons. They reached a high of 32 million or 33 million tons of consumption. And so that's still to play out, I think, with where they are in this current season in terms of application, excess or not.","And whether it's China, yes, I think there's some debate on that issue, but again corn application for urea in China is about, I think, 18% of their nitrogen or their urea demand. And so, it's a broader issue than just corn. Corn acres being cut globally, not necessarily so. You're seeing maybe a 3 million to 4 million cut in the United States this year versus last year, but significant growth in Brazil and Argentina. We're seeing tremendous demand for UAN in Argentina, direct reflection on corn and corn yields. But you've got yields in Brazil that could increase by 25%, with increased applications of N. They generally apply with a little bit of N and possibly a little bit of urea topping that on the second crop, but not much. And I think there's some precision ag improvements that could take place in Brazil that could improve yields. So I don't agree with your point on N being overapplied globally.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean that's the story at the P and the K guys, but not what the farmers actually realize. The other thing, Andrew, that I'd point out is, we look at ag demand growth to be in the sort of 1% to 2% range and industrial growth to be more in the 2% to 3% range. And there's a lot of drivers around the industrial side, whether it's ongoing adoption and implementation of the mission statement activities, as well as a host of intermediate and feedstock chemical applications, anything from resins to melamine to other things, but also sort of tend to track population as opposed to other things, and there's a tie-in there with GDP. So, there is pretty good correlation going back in time, but we're not counting on sort of ag demand growth to be the driver of this long-term.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then, just on the new builds, I mean, obviously, it doesn't make sense to build a new plant in the U.S. because it's pretty expensive and you probably would lose money in today's environment. But there are other regions that seem like they're willing to build plants, or at least looking at it. And maybe could you just share your views on the CapEx cost globally?","And then, maybe are there regions that you feel they could build a plant even if maybe a project doesn't meet like, let's say, a 15% hurdle rate, as they would have to in the U.S., but maybe provide social benefits, for example, like in India that you've mentioned that they want to refurbish or rebuild plants? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I think you always have a situation where if a government decides that they're going to make that investment for social reasons, then they're in a position to be able to do things from a \u2013 that are non-economic. I would say, while the labor component would be cheaper in other regions of the world, labor represents somewhere in the neighborhood of between 45% and 55% of the cost of a facility. You've got the engineering and fabrication of very specialized metallurgy vessels and so forth.","And those costs are going to be largely euro denominated or maybe euro and yen denominated for a lot of that stuff, particularly the really high cost technical pieces of it. And so while you can build a plant in other certain regions of the world for a bit less, our view is it's pretty tough to build integrated ammonia urea complex for less than about $1.8 billion to $2 billion. It's tough to do that even if you've got really, really cheap labor involved to do it.","And so there are going to be places, Nigeria, Iran that are plentiful in gas where labor's cheap and there's some benefits to building those things that may get built. But, again, if you look at the projects that have been announced that are verifiable, where there's actual work being done, it's well below what the industry growth rate is, after you include this year.","So, we feel optimistic at least about the next sort of four, five years.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Neil Chandan Sanyal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Neil calling in for Vincent. It seems that UAN prices have been holding up better than urea prices recently on a nutrient ton basis. I'm just wondering how do you see that relative price dynamic evolving through the year.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","They are holding up and we see that. And I think it goes to Tony's comment of because we're a broad-based company with assets and storage assets, production assets throughout the Corn Belt, we're able to see we think very positive price realizations at our interior plants.","And I do think, because UAN is consumed in just a few places and also produced in just a few places, it's not as easy to move around as urea. So we believe that UAN on a relative basis will hold up well throughout this year. There will be a correction for pricing come the fill period and that'll be probably later in the year. We think that because of the late planting this year and late field work, you're going to see UAN applications going well into July. And similar to last year, where we launched our fill program in late July, you're probably going to see something similar to that timeframe for 2017.","Neil Chandan Sanyal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","This is Oliver Rowe in for Ben. Thanks for taking the question. The near-term excess capacity story is pretty well understood. I think less certain is how long the shakeout period is going to last. And when I look at your capacity addition slide, there is a small deficiency beginning in sort of 2018, 2019, but a lot of excess capacity in the years preceding that. So in terms of the S&D balance, it seems like it could be stressed for quite some time as the prior additions are absorbed. So how confident are you in your view that 2018 is the year of recovery versus say 2019?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I don't think that what you're going to see is a gigantic bounce in 2018, right. I think what you're going to see is it starts to come up off the kind of lower levels and then it's going to continue to accelerate as you get into 2019 and 2020, but we fully expect 2018 to be a better year than 2017. So, anytime you're kind of moving the right way up the curve, that's a good story.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, I think the other thing I'd point out is, if you look at our slide 14 and then also what we've got in terms of the closures, we've been pretty conservative, given what we know about or believe we know about the cost structures of some of these plants. We've been pretty conservative in respect to what we think the closures are likely to be. It's possible that there could be a greater level of disinvestment and higher number of closures, particularly in China, than what we have forecast in. So I think it's worth taking a look at sort of that part of the slide deck because I think that what \u2013 if you're going to see a steeper inflection point, it's going to be because closures happen more quickly and in a higher volume that what we're showing on our projection.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","The other thing is, even though you're absolutely right, Neil, that there's a fair bit of excess capacity that come online in sort of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, it's not that it's easy to idle or take a plant down and just let it sit there and then be in a position to bring it back up. In the past, we've included some slides that indicate the challenges with having a plant that's off for more than about 18 months, ever bringing it back up again.","So the benefit of sort of a fairly long period here between kind of 2016, 2017, and maybe in the beginning of 2018, that's painful as a lot of those plants go down and they're never heard from again. And so while there is some overcapacity above and beyond that's been built, that sloppiness tends to filter itself out through the system.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. I just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're going to approach the summer fill season. It seems like last year, the buyers were a lot more cautious. I mean how do you sort of think about setting the price, given that there is more capacity out there this year and then a new competitor up and running in the Midwest or even price it to get a historical movement of product, or even try to be more price sensitive even if that means slower pace of dealer participation?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, if you were to ask that question last year and see that how it unfolded last year, I think it would have been \u2013 it was just different. And so, normally, we used to take a pretty healthy book on in June and ship against that book July through December. And last year, that just did not happen. And we expected it, we planned for it and we utilized the various options that were available to the company, which were alternating between products, urea, ammonia, and UAN, exporting significant amount where we could and did, as well as utilizing our storage capacity and moving product to different markets in the United States through our Jones Act vessel that we brought online last year.","Customers were unwilling then to take positions. It was more of unsure what the forward market would like and not wanting to take a risk position that they felt was averse. I think that's the exact same scenario we have coming into this year with new capacity coming online also. And as Tony mentioned in his comments, we have to wait for the new trade flows to materialize and for product to sell out, and customers as well as suppliers to kind of get their sea legs and we believe that's going to take time.","We are patient and we're in conversation with our customers now in preparation for that period. And we believe we'll be able to move through it fairly well.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Michael, one other thing I'd add to it is, and Bert alluded to this, but I just want to emphasize it a little bit more, which is the degree of the flexibility we have from a production standpoint at Donaldsonville. We can effectively decide to granulate the entirety of the new urea plant. And if the demand isn't there or the nutrient ton value isn't there, turn off the acid plant for a period of time if we want to. And we are bringing on a DEF unit this summer in Donaldsonville as well.","And so, one of the things that Bert and his team constantly are doing is the trade between what's the value per nutrient ton and different options we have from a production standpoint, and instead of blowing our brains out on a low fill price, we may decide to granulate a lot more where there is many more homes for it on a global basis.","And so, really, there's a lot of different arrows in our quiver based on product flexibility and export optionality. And Bert and his team are going to look at that and figure out a way to maximize our results, whatever that may look like.","Operator","Thank you. And our next comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. So, it sounds like the expectation is that wet weather will shift demand to urea and UAN, but you also invested heavily in your ammonia terminal system in the 2010 through 2014 timeframe. So, you can meet ammonia demand in a very efficient manner. And I am wondering if we'll see less of a switch than we might have historically and how we should think about when the window for direct applications in ammonia closes for the majority of the Corn Belt?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Sandy, it's kind of fun. I am going to let Bert answer the back half of that question about timing and when it shifts and so forth. We have a little bit of a love hate relationship with ammonia, I'd say. On the one hand, we've got a very unique asset system that nobody else can replicate. On the other hand, you know that our adjusted gross margin per nutrient ton on ammonia tends to be relatively cheap compared to the other upgraded products. And so, we've got a unique capability of serving a particular need and yet we don't get paid quite as much for it as when the ammonia season is a bit of a wash out and people have to go heavy up on the upgraded products, because we make a lot more when that happens. So, as I said, it's a little bit of a love hate relationship with ammonia, but, Bert, do you want to -","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, when I look at the ammonia season, it's a six month process, so January through June. And as we mentioned in our opening comments, we had a very good first quarter. The Southwest Southern and Southwest part of the United States where the wheat and early corn applications were taking place, we did very, very well and had almost double our normal shipments coming out of our Oklahoma plants.","And as we move through, like I said, it's kind of the I-90 North, and in the Canada, it's still to go and we have our terminals ready to go, a lot of that product is sold, and we do have some product to sell and we think that'll go, whether it's through the side-dress and still some pre-plant application. So we're not giving up on ammonia, but I do think possibly on an aggregate basis for the sector, fall and spring coupled together probably will be lower than historical numbers.","So, let's say, it's 200,000 tons to 300,000 tons and that's just \u2013 I'm just putting that as an example, that means you're going to need that much more by factor of two to three of UAN or urea. So either side of that coin, we're positive and we're prepared for it. And we do expect, like I said earlier to you, yes, that doesn't take place on ammonia, you're going to see a significant amount of demand shifting to UAN and urea that on the margin probably will \u2013 then move prices up higher.","Sandy H.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of the presentation.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today's conference, Mr. Dan Swenson, Treasurer. Sir, please proceed.","Daniel Swenson - Treasurer","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us on this call. I'm Dan Swenson, and I'm joined today by Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Supply Chain.","On this call we will review CF's agreement with OCI as well as highlights from our second quarter 2015 earnings results. Along the way we will be referring to several slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call we will host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on slide two of our webcast presentation and from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","With that let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. We are really excited to provide details on what is a transformational transaction with exceptional benefits to our shareholders, our employees and especially our customers.","Before we discuss the OCI combination, let me take a minute to review our results for the second quarter. Last night we reported strong results for the period with a record best safety incident rate and EBITDA of $670 million. For the first half of 2015 our EBITDA was $1.2 billion, which is particularly strong performance given the high level of global supply, driven by exports from China.","We've taken on some very advantageous hedge positions for a meaningful percentage of our gas needs for the remainder of this year and calendar years 2016 and 2017. We have a terrific order book for the second half of this year and we made good progress on our capacity expansion projects. Given the extremely wet weather in Donaldsonville, the urea start-up has been delayed by a few weeks, but we expect to bring it on line by the end of September or beginning October.","We executed a number of strategic initiatives since our last call, including the divestiture of our interest in KeyTrade and the Houston ammonia terminal and the acquisition of the remaining 50% of GrowHow. I want to extend an enthusiastic welcome to the 550 GrowHow employees who officially joined the CF team last Friday. We're excited about the contributions they will make, and we're well-positioned for continued strong results across the company in the coming quarters.","Now let's talk about the transaction we just announced this morning. As you saw in our press release, we have reached an agreement with OCI which will transform CF, creating the largest publicly traded nitrogen company. We are combining CF with OCI's European, North American and Global distribution businesses. The main operating assets include the facility in Geleen, Netherlands; a greenfield nitrogen facility in Wever, Iowa; OCI's 80% interest in an ammonia and methanol complex in Beaumont, Texas; a global distribution business in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and a 45% stake in Natgasoline, a greenfield methanol project located in Beaumont, Texas.","These businesses will complement and expand our best-in-class asset base and distribution network. Our customers and the farmers they serve will benefit from improved logistics, reduced shipping distances, and a more flexible supply of fertilizer products to better serve their needs.","We expect to generate approximately $500 million of annual after-tax run rate synergies from the optimization of operations, capital and corporate structure, which will benefit the combined company's shareholders. The transaction is expected to generate free cash flow accretion to CF shareholders in the mid- to high-teens versus an already very attractive standalone base case.","The OCI businesses will be combined with CF in a new U.K. company. OCI's shareholders will receive approximately 27.7% of the equity in the new U.K. parent plus approximately $700 million of consideration in either cash or stock at CF's discretion at the time of close. Additionally, the new U.K. company will purchase a 45% stake in OCI's Natgasoline greenfield methanol project for approximately $500 million, and we will have a call option on the remaining equity. The new U.K. company will be led by the existing CF management team and maintain its operational headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois.","As part of the transaction, the new company will assume approximately $2 billion of debt associated with the OCI businesses. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have provided a fully committed bridge facility to fund the cash needs upon close, and we are committed to maintain investment-grade credit ratings after the completion of the combination.","On a combined basis we are creating a company with the premier global operating footprint in the industry, increasing our scale, scope and ability to serve our customers. In North America we will leverage our existing distribution network, reducing transportation costs and time delays getting product into the hands of our customers, the benefits of which will serve U.S. farmers.","We will be adding one of Europe's largest nitrogen facilities in Geleen, Netherlands to complement the two GrowHow facilities we recently acquired. We expect significant operational synergies through the combination of these businesses. We're also excited to be adding CAN and melamine into our portfolio, as these products are in high demand. Through the existing Beaumont facility and the greenfield Natgasoline project once it becomes operational, we will become the largest methanol producer in North America.","I want to point you for a moment to slide seven. One of the most exciting aspects of this announcement is that both companies bring significant capacity expansion projects to the combination. The new company will have an unparalleled growth pipeline that will increase total production capacity by approximately 65% over the next 24 months.","As you see on slide eight, our expansion into methanol is a natural one, given our previous experience in that business. CF's core capabilities in chemical production, storage and shipping all apply equally well to methanol as they do to nitrogen. In fact, we produce methanol at Woodward and previously owned the Beaumont facility.","Methanol and ammonia both rely on natural gas as the key raw material feedstock for their production in much of the world. Anthracite-based coal production in China is the high cost producer that sets price floor for both products, giving North American gas-based producers a sustainable cost advantage.","With the additional methanol production, CF will join a group of over 15 producers of ammonia across the globe that also produce significant volumes of methanol.","I want to call your attention to slide 10 for a moment. CF has a track record of dramatically outperforming our peers and the broader market in creating value for shareholders. Since our IPO 10 years ago, we have a total shareholder return approaching 1,900%, one of the top 10 performing companies in the entire S&P 500 over that period of time. The combination we are announcing this morning sets the stage for the next 10 years.","Turning to slide 11, this is a view of our business that we have shared in the past. The biggest difference is in the sheer scale and cash generating capability of the company we are creating. We expect that on a cumulative basis from closing the transaction through the end of 2019 we will generate approximately between $8 billion and $9 billion of unallocated cash available to continue driving shareholder returns. Our commitment to the capital allocation principles which have guided us well over the past years remains unchanged.","The stock structure of this deal allows both sets of shareholders to benefit from the significant value creation in this transaction. As I mentioned earlier, we estimate approximately $500 million of annual after-tax run rate synergies from the optimization of operations, capital and corporate structure. We view this as a straightforward integration of well-matched assets in both North America and Europe. The CF management team has approved \u2013 has proven its capabilities in executing integration in the past with the Terra deal.","The new CF will have an enterprise value of over $30 billion once all the new capacity comes on line and the synergies have been fully capitalized. With this announcement we are creating the world's premier fertilizer company.","To wrap up, I'm excited by the tremendous benefits that this transaction will deliver to our shareholders, employees and most importantly our customers and the American farmer.","Before we jump into Q&A I want to recognize a few of the very weary-looking people around the table with me today, many of which have been going without sleep for days but without whom this transaction would not have occurred. First, I want to thank Nassef Sawiris and his entire team at OCI. They are terrific to work with and I look forward to welcoming Nassef as our largest shareholder in the future.","I want to thank Brian Duwe and Rich Witzel and the entire team at Skadden; Rich Robinson and his group at Morgan Stanley; John Vaske and the entire team at Goldman Sachs; and especially my team: Doug, Dennis, Adam, Rich, Gene, Dan, Terry and a host of others. But what really keeps us going is the folks that run the business day in and day out, Bert, Chris, Phil and Wendy. Thank you for all of your efforts.","We also look forward to welcoming to our Board in the future Alan Heuberger who is currently with the Bill & Melinda Gates Investments; and Greg Heckman, formerly the CEO of Gavilon.","With that I will now open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Our first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. So just very quickly, OCI clearly has a vast array of distribution assets globally. Can you comment a little more on how these assets will augment your existing production and growth initiatives, specifically from D-ville? And then any comments there particularly on the FITCO JV would be greatly appreciated.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. So as we talked about before, D-ville is ideally situated to be able to export at those periods of time when there's attractive margin opportunities by exporting product. The fact that OCI has a really well-established distribution system and capability, particularly in regions as you mentioned like FITCO in Brazil that are in nitrogen-deficit areas that need to import products, matches up extremely well with our ability to export at those times. So we view this as a hand-in-glove kind of synergistic opportunity.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. And just, it's kind of a corollary of that question, but you've been fairly successful managing the UAN balance in the U.S., but can you see \u2013 can you just comment a little bit more on how you see this evolving once Wever's online? And then also can you parallel the theme about how you view the CAN market in Europe as well, please?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so, Chris, I'll start off and then I'll ask Bert to comment as well. But look, even after all of the capacity that being contemplated in North America comes online, the U.S. is still going to be importing about 25% of our total nitrogen requirements and still importing well over a million tons of UAN. So the market needs all of the product, and in fact UAN is the highest growth product within North America in terms of usage. It's got a lot of benefits to farmers and there's not any kind of problem associated with managing UAN. It's a product that's desperately needed and we're there to serve farmers. Did you want to?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","No, I agree, I think what this allows us to do is to have additional source points to fit into our existing system to logistically serve our customers in a more efficient way than we do today. So we're excited about the additional capacity that will come on, and also to help our retail customers and wholesale customers. As Tony mentioned we will still get import market, but by putting this together with our system you're allowing that end of the value chain to not have to import, taking on possibly a $10 million position that has to come in a ship and have a 60-day voyage from purchase to delivery. With this additional capacity coming online integrated into our system, those customers can then buy smaller lots, be more efficient with their capital, and then they can serve the farmer. We do not sell to the farmer; we sell to the retail and the wholesale unit systems. So we believe this will be advantageous.","Regarding CAN in Europe, it's a great product. CAN and AN are used in a different way than we do in the United States for agriculture, different type of agricultural system. But CAN has been a growth product in a number of different areas as well as some other treatment areas. So I think it will be a good addition to our platform.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and congratulations, everyone. Quick question on the synergies, can you sort of, I know it says that they're going to \u2013 you'll get the full run rate by 2018, but any sense of how they should phase in? And can you kind of bucket them a little bit for us?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There are significant operational synergies in here, just like we saw with Terra. We're going to have, as Bert mentioned, an ability to plug Wever directly into our distribution network and reduce total product miles that are shipped, reducing logistics costs, getting our products into the hands of our customers in a more efficient way and a more timely way. Additionally, we see substantial synergy opportunities by managing and integrating Geleen with the U.K. business at GrowHow.","On top of that, our SG&A load on a per-ton basis will get more scale, and therefore lower cost per ton. And we believe that there's going to be substantial capital cost savings as well. If you look at the facilities being built in Wever, it's a Kellogg ammonia plant, sort of a big brother to the existing Kellogg systems that we have in place, but operating with a lot of similar-sized equipment. There's a Stamicarbon urea plant that's being built that is very similar to the new plants that we're building at Port Neal as well as at D-ville and Udaask (17:43) UAN complex, very similar to the one that's going in at Donaldsonville. So we have an opportunity to pool our spare parts as well as our engineering capability and get more for less. Again, I think that's good for the marketplace and the farmers.","And then finally there are some structural benefits to this deal as well. We expect to get a big chunk of those right away, and then the rest will phase in sort of over a year or two timeframe before we get everything running on all cylinders. But we expect to ramp in those savings pretty quickly.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just on methanol. Could you, I know you mentioned sort of is the same cost curve dynamics as nitrogen does with the anthracite coal in China. But could you give a view on the dynamics in the U.S. market? How different are they from nitrogen in terms of being in a net importer or exporter? And sort of what's the outlook for S&D there?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so it's looking, methanol in North America right now, North America is similar to nitrogen in a deficit situation. We are a net importer. Methanol application demand is growing by about 7.5% per year globally. Now a lot of that growth is in China, but North America will continue to be in a deficit situation for the next, at minimum, several years and maybe beyond that. And so the dynamics at play are ones that we love in nitrogen, and it's basically a very natural add-on to what we already do.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks and congratulations again.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I'd like to clarify on the synergies, Tony. How much of that $500 million is operational versus how much would be from the \u2013 taking the tax rate down to 20%?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Don. There is quite a bit on the operational side. Obviously if you look at what our profitability is and the fact that we're a 34% taxpayer currently and what it will be at 20%, there's an awful lot of value there as well.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then just on the near-term business, Bert, you seemed a little more cautious on the near-term outlook than I've heard you in previous presentations, or at least that was the implication from the slide. Can you just talk about how you see second half and first part of 2016 unfolding in U.S. nitrogen markets?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. If I expressed caution I would say probably just a relist. We're in a market that is a global market, and we're competing across the globe as a producer and as well as a distributor of these products. And so we pay attention to a lot of the macro issues as well as regional issues. Macro issues being currencies, commodities, and we've seen some fluctuations in the commodity \u2013 the soft commodity markets the last few months; a rising, corn market then a falling corn market which drives demand in North America and South America. But also some of the economic turbulences, whether it be Greece or China and how that can affect our markets. So I think where we've been is we've been prudent. We've built a very solid order book going through or into Q4 for UAN. And we're preparing for fall applications of ammonia and taking orders for that period also.","So I \u2013 if I sounded \u2013 and I hope I didn't sound negative because I think we are very positive. We are looking at almost 90 million acres of corn to be planted for next year; those applications will start in the fall.","We are seeing some difficulties in Brazil today and I think that's a currency issue, and that's based on last year with some debt, dollar debt coming due, but it's the real or their local currency has put the farmers as well as those who purchased fertilizer earlier in dollars at a disadvantage. So we have to see how that develops and how demand develops going forward.","But our order book is solid. And I think CF is well positioned for this year and probably into next year.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson of Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much and congrats again. Can you just talk about how the market share for nitrogen consumption in North America will look say in 2017, 2018 once Wever's on and your expansions are finished? And does that potentially play into some regulatory approval risk? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Ben. Thanks. You know look, we don't even look at market share. For us it's not a relevant measure because we run all of our plants 365, 24\/7 as hard as we possibly can, and the U.S. and North America is still in a major nitrogen deficit situation. Based on everything that's under construction today, North America is going to continue to be an import marketplace, bringing in about 25% of our total nitrogen requirements. So market share is sort of a meaningless number. We make every ton that we possibly can anyway. And because it is a global market, and because North America has to bid into the system 25% of our total needs from offshore, pricing is set in the market based on what the requirement is to bid those tons in and get them up into the Corn Belt. And everything trades on a global basis.","So look, we don't view there being a significant issue here from an anti-trust perspective.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. So quick question, the production assets in North Africa, they're not part of the deal; I was wondering if you could discuss kind of what drove this decision? Was it just political considerations? And then if we're trying to assess the economics of the transaction, what type of EBITDA contribution from those assets should be backed out?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So good morning, Sandy. Thanks for the question. You know this transaction is really about doing what we do best and the assets that fit well with our system and our network. And so that's really what drove the configuration. This package of assets really helps us drive a bunch of the synergies that we were looking to try to capture. And one of the benefits of this deal, because it is a stock-based consideration, is that shareholders from both companies participate in the synergies ratably on a go-forward basis.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up question. DEF, I know this has been a focus that could generate let's say better domestic demand for nitrogen. How does this transaction help you potentially gain an even better footprint in that market going forward in North America and maybe in Europe as well?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So as you mentioned, DEF is a growing product line primarily driven by emissions abatement. It is a product that we have continued to invest behind additional production capacity. And it's one of the product lines that's going to be available at the Wever facility. And that just, again, fits into our distribution network very well. It allows us to serve national accounts like Love's and Travel America and Pilot and others in terms of being able to meet needs across their entire network from another source point. So that's another strong element of this transaction.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. What will be the employee count of the new company? And what's the trailing EBITDA of OCI that you're buying?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Jeff, you've absolutely got me and everyone else around the table stumped with the employee count question. It's not something we've focused on, but we can certainly figure that out and get it back to you.","Again, we're not really looking at a trailing EBITDA. It's sort of irrelevant given the amount of capacity that we have coming online. We're going to be growing total capacity versus our base today by 65% in the next 24 months. So the right way to think about this is we have two world-scale plants under construction that are going to be online in the next 12 months. Wever is a world-scale plant that's going to be online in the next 12 months and Natgasoline in 2017.","So as we look at sort of what both sides are contributing to this, we've got four world-scale plants that are in construction, and it's not a trailing basis that this deal is predicated on, it's what the future holds for us going forward.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What are the costs of the $500 million in synergies?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cost to achieve it?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So look, there is obviously transaction cost associated with the deal. There's going to be some IT and integration costs going forward. A lot of those are kind of year one impact, and then the run rate synergies are going to kick in for that. But transaction costs would be typical for a deal of this size.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, hi, good morning, Tony.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So any comment on China. With recent changes in coal prices there it seems like your new band for marginal cost of production is $260 per metric ton to $300 per metric ton, and that bottom seems a bit lower than before. So can you talk about how you see the cost curve, and what kind of urea price did you use in valuing OCI?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah, good morning, P.J., this is Bert. And when you look at what's going on in China, and we've talked about this in past quarters how different regulation, different governmental edicts, different sector controls that are trying to be put in place on the nitrogen group, coal prices have been changing. We believe they're at a low and over time will probably be moderating up.","We have through various industry publications that number of $260 to $300 per metric ton has been put out there as probably the basis for the marginal producer. However, what we're seeing today is not a lot of activity below $280 per metric ton. And at the recent Indian tender you saw a lot of resistance from the Chinese industry and not a lot of support. Now, that being said, probably 800,000 tons will be heading to India on this recent tender with the rest from Iran and maybe a few other locations like the Baltics or the Black Sea.","But that being said, I think the Chinese producer is struggling today; and with the projection of the new VAT tax that's set to come online in September, and then what we've talked about in the past on other costs increasing, just operational costs such as freight and production, that you're going to see that marginal cost increasing slowly. But that does provide a very nice core for probably the industry around the world and for CF when we're buying gas at $2.70.","And so for a urea price for the deal, I'll hand that back to Tony.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. P.J., on that front we take a look at kind of overall supply and demand and what's coming online in terms of new capacity. But given there's a number of producers in China that are hemorrhaging money, and in fact, the Nitrogen Association tried back in May, June to put a floor underneath the pricing. That worked for a while and then it kind of has traded back down again.","Our view is for the foreseeable future the industry is going to continue to trade in a supply-driven mode where there's excess capacity. And it's really the Chinese marginal production that's going to dictate the floor. And so our view is sort of $300 per metric ton plus or minus is not out of whack in terms of how to think about the floor price from a traded ton perspective.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Thank you for that. And with this transaction you add methanol to your portfolio, and yes, they both are based on natural gas. (31:37) different because with methanol you get into gasoline. You get into olefins via the MTO process. So what are your thoughts on that? And do you want to be in methanol long term? Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, P.J. We're excited about methanol because it allows us to leverage our core capabilities in terms of our process and plant expertise, operation, safety. Being able to produce, handle, store and ship chemicals. We do that day in and day out. And the operation of a methanol plant is very similar to an ammonia plant. And so again, our process engineering guys will be a great help to us in that regard.","It does provide a different end-use market which tends to be a bit more ratable, and it diversifies a bit our sector exposure. So there's some benefits there. And I think that is noticed and picked up by some of the rating agencies as well.","So look, we're excited about it and we think it's a great opportunity. And we'll evaluate it as we go and make the decisions based on what kind of return of capital and expectations we have out of that business versus redeploying capital into other things or growth in that business. So it's really going to depend upon as we get into it how the business performs, and is at the right place for us to have investment of our shareholders' money.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Adam.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I guess for me the question, in the press release and on the slides you allude to a mid-teens free cash flow accretion relative to the CF standalone base case, and I want to just be clear on that base case, if that assumed further share repurchases beyond the current authorization in 2016 and 2017 that had previously been part of the discussion, given a significant unallocated capital or cash flow in the next couple of years.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks, Adam. So, look, the way we look at this is we've got the industry forecast on price strips and so forth, we run them through the model and look at how much cash flow is available to us as a standalone entity, and then we look at what it looks like under the new configuration using that same price strip with the different platform. And of course we assume an ongoing return-of-capital program that's consistent with our capital allocation priorities, as we've done in the past. And so our view is that's an important element of continuing to drive shareholder value and we've modeled the same assumption into both cases.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just quickly the call option to purchase the remaining 55% of the OCI Natgasoline project, any incremental color on the terms of the call?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so, it's done at the same valuation as the original 45% purchases with equity appreciation for the developer\/owner OCI of about 10% per year going forward. So it gives them a fair return to continue to develop and bring that project online. It allows us to participate in it once it's online without an additional capital load hitting our free cash flow between now and then. And it also allows us to really get to know the methanol market and evaluate what the return profile looks like to be able to make that decision appropriately in 2017.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yes, thank you. With respect to the incremental tons that you expect to come out of Donaldsonville, how would you split those between the domestic versus the export market? And has that changed post the GrowHow and OCI deals?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So \u2013 Thanks, Steve. You know, look, we have been for the last couple of years exporting somewhere in the neighborhood of 500,000 tons a year to 700,000 tons a year. Our expectation was that would likely grow to about 1.5 million tons a year, sort of even without this combination. I think what it does is it gives us access to some additional distribution points around the globe. It allows us to leverage some of the locations where OCI has some great relationships. We can think differently about product into the U.K. and\/or into Europe leveraging the distribution systems, either through GrowHow and\/or Geleen.","So on the margin I'd say we might be \u2013 have opportunities to create incremental value for shareholders by exporting more. But time's going to tell, and Bert's going to do the analysis on what the net backs are for us by keeping that product here and sending it up the river versus moving it offshore. Bert, do you have...","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yeah. I think the main concept is we're ambivalent whether it stays in the domestic market or it's exported. It's a net back analysis or a platform analysis on what is best for the system. And there are times when we go through a dearth of orders in North America it makes sense for us to move product offshore in a seamless way, which you've seen us do into France, the Netherlands, and the U.K. for UAN, as well as for ammonium nitrate we've done it in Central and South America; same with urea, and ammonia, we've moved that all over the world. And so we're constantly looking at our platform, our products, our production mix to put that into the right profitability position for the company. But I do see us exporting more as we build \u2013 as we have more capacity and more opportunities and more distribution opportunities, we think that will only grow.","Steve Byrne - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","After your talks with Yara ended, you talked about how valuable Brazilian distribution would be. So can you give us a sense of how OCI distribution in Brazil compares with what you might have gotten with Yara? And should we still assume that you're interested in expanding Brazilian distribution beyond what you're getting with OCI?","And this is a second question. How much does your capital spend change? I don't have a great sense of where these OCI projects are in their spend cycles?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. So very quickly in terms of Brazil, OCI has a terrific joint venture partnership with FITCO in Brazil. It's a very valuable relationship. They take no currency risk. They get cash delivery before product hits. They don't have to demurrage costs or anything.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It really is a terrific relationship, and we very much look forward to continuing to work with and trying to expand that relationship over time. We think that working with partners that know how to manage the local market where we're not taking currency risk or inventory risk is the best way to go. We'd prefer to partner with people as opposed to having to own the value chain end to end, and let those people manage risk in the way that they're better able to do it than we can.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","That's spot on. What you're seeing with the FITCO or with many other opportunities like that is our desire to do what we do well, which is produce and distribute our products to a point, but not being exposed to currency, demurrage, and other risks that are associated with some of these offshore markets.","We know the FITCO people well and the Fertipar people well. But Brazil is a tough market. And I think you're seeing that in some of the players today, some of the bankruptcies and risks that are coming out now today with the currency problems. So I think our direction is a little bit different than PCS's and Mosaic where they desire the distribution to the end customer. That might work well for their business, but I think where we are, we're very satisfied just staying what we do best.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then, Mark, your question about additional capital requirements. So this is the way I think about it. By the time we close this transaction, Wever will be up and operating and D-ville will basically be up and operating. The only CapEx left in terms of the capacity expansion projects for us is going to be the remaining tail on getting Port Neal operational. As I mentioned, OCI, who does a terrific job of developing and constructing world-class assets, is doing the Natgas project, and so they're doing the CapEx spend on that to get it up and operational. So there's no capital load on us relative to getting that project up and running.","And think about it this way which is on an ongoing CapEx maintenance perspective, we're increasing our total production capacity when we're fully up and operational and OCI is fully up and operational by about 25%. And so our sustaining capital is going to go up by about 25%, which means if we were spending on average about call it $400 million, it's going to be in the range of $500 million-ish in the future. So that's probably the right way to think about it.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for providing color on your forward natural gas hedges. Could you give us any sense for whether OCI has done any sort of forward hedging on natural gas and how you sort of think about potentially managing some of the risk in Europe, and what are your thoughts on locking in some of your cost basis in that side of the business? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Michael. So right now there is not a significant hedge position in place, at least from an economic benefit or exposure perspective on the businesses that we're buying. We are absolutely looking at how we want to manage gas purchase across our European system now with the combination of both GrowHow and the Geleen asset going forward. We think there are going to be some opportunities there to bring some of the same approach and discipline that we have in the U.S. with our existing asset base to bear.","But the great thing about the assets in Europe is the gas cost is declining, particularly when a lot of it is the oil-linked gas is some of the highest-priced stuff in Europe right now and it continues to drop with Brent price dropping. So these assets are getting more and more attractive as opposed to the other way around. It's really an exciting time to be adding them to our portfolio.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Great. And then as a follow-up, with respect to how you plan to run the European business kind of going forward, would you expect that the decisions will be made out of Deerfield or are you going to have kind of a separate European sales force and, I don't know, team leaders, and will there be kind of an equivalent of Bert in Europe or will things be sort of run out of Deerfield going forward? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, Michael. So we're absolutely going to have someone moving in to the U.K. to be running the U.K. operations. Actually that's part of Bert's team. And because it is a global market and prices are set globally we're going to be very coordinated in terms of what happens over there with what we do on this side. So think about it as being a coordination effort but local decision-making based on the dynamics in play in the local market.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Neivert of Cowen and Co. your line is open.","Charles Neivert - Cowen & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. One quick question, with all of the capacity now that you're going to be owning in Iowa when it's all said and done, do you think that the Midwest premium that now exists on products like urea and ammonia is going to continue at the current levels, or do you think it shrinks down because you're no longer going to be transporting as much? And I mean that's always been an advantage for you guys, your transport costs were far lower and therefore you sort of could take advantage of that premium more than most. Do you think that premium comes down a bit?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank, Charlie. You know again, as I mentioned before, North America's going to continue to be about 25% running a deficit, so \u2013 and that product is \u2013 tends to be used extensively in the growing regions in the Mid-Continent sort of Corn Belt region. So there will still be over a million tons of UAN that's got to find its way up the Mississippi and into the application region. There is still all that ammonia and urea that's coming into the country. And the way that pricing is set, as you well know, it's the price in the Gulf plus the transport cost to get in to market. And that \u2013 it doesn't change as a result of this transaction; it's more of the same.","Charles Neivert - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Also, you didn't mention this quarter \u2013 this is just sort of going back to the quarter, how much of the ammonia that you did this particular quarter was \u2013 went to Mosaic through the Caribbean operations?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to ask Bert to handle that.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Yes. The Mosaic agreement today is principally out of Trinidad, and so we're bringing that product from PLNL, our joint venture based in Trinidad, on vessels up to the Tampa terminal, and it's about 50,000 tons, 60,000 tons per quarter. And so not \u2013 when you look at the totality of what we did in the quarter coupled with what we did in the six months, we were \u2013 had almost a record, actually our second best year or six month period in ammonia. Why? Well, a lot of that was driven with the favorable weather in the Corn Belt and the ability to continue to move ammonia into different parts of the Corn Belt as demand materialized in those positions. So it was a very, very good ammonia season for us to date.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing I'd say in that regard, Charlie, is Bert's being a little modest here but he's really led a significant amount of capital investment in our distribution facility so that we can bring more product in more quickly, we can refresh and reload the tanks and then we can also do outbound much more quickly. And as a result of a bunch of those investments in our asset and distribution network, we're able to serve the needs of the customers that much more efficiently, which is why we continue to deliver terrific ammonia volumes year-in and year-out.","Charles Neivert - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Andrew D. Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So actually want to focus on the tax part of synergies, I mean with the regulatory focus on companies trying to lower their tax rate by moving headquarters, can you just talk about any potential regulatory challenges that you might expect and how you plan to address those potential issues?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Andrew, thanks for the question. Look, I would view this as a combination with great industrial logic. This is sort of normal course, cross-border M&A. And the issue at the end of the day is OCI is a Dutch company. And in order to be willing to do this combination, we needed to have a European headquarters. They weren't interested and it didn't make sense from a value destruction standpoint to keep the headquarters here. So that was not a deal that was on the table. They weren't interested in it. And the only way to really do it was to move the headquarters. So this is not a tax-driven deal. Sure it's a nice little bit of juice, but this is a deal with great industrial logic, great strategic benefits. And it's sort of ordinary course, cross-border M&A.","Andrew D. Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following on the export questions earlier, could you just maybe compare the net-backs that you get and the margins for exported product versus some of the U.S. product that you sell?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President-Sales, Distribution and Market Development","Well, it depends product by product. And we have exported in the past year all four of our major nitrogen products, being ammonium nitrate, UAN, urea and ammonia. And you have to remember for each of those products there are different demand periods. So, for example, ammonia is a narrow window in November and then in April and May. For UAN it's mostly an April\/May consumption period, urea is more consistent throughout the year. And so as we look at different markets or different points in the United States, that can be a freight view from our different production locations that are on different railroads. And so when you're looking at an export opportunity, that is at Donaldsonville, that's the only facility in North America that can export. And so it's compared against that next best option for freight and delivery cost, net cost, to the retail or wholesale customer.","And so compared against that and the timing and the shipments and the needs of the system, exports on paper can be a lower net-back but an optionality can be a better decision for the company. So that's how we look at it. We look at it holistically at the time and trying to plan our production runs and product runs to best benefit the system and our customers throughout the year.","Andrew D. Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.","And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Congratulations again, everybody.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Matthew.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So looking at this transaction versus others that you looked at in the past that ended up not going through, it looks like the Wever plant, the facility is a major difference, and its presence here in the given the competitive landscape of nitrogen, North America. When you're looking out over other projects that have been proposed, that are in near term or could be constructed, any other opportunities, anything else that looks interesting to you if you think that consolidation in the North American market is something that's attractive?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we're at the moment worried about just kind of getting this one both integrated and firing on all cylinders, so we've had a lot of people kind of burning the midnight oil in order to get this one to this stage, and we've got to get it closed and get it operating before we think about anything else.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Fair enough. We're all paid to look ahead.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're excited about 55% new capacity coming online in the next 24 months. That's some pretty sizable growth right there.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, it's true. I told my wife all about it this morning. Let me ask this then on methanol, because I like I'm sure many others here are going to be less familiar with this market. In North America methanol as a fuel additive and a potential blend into the fuel stream, is that a real opportunity for growth here? Is that something that's, given the change maybe in the political climate around the ethanol mandate, is that something that seems realistic?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there is a possibility actually to move or to do a methanol-to-gasoline process. And that is one of the options that, in fact, OCI is looking at for the Natgasoline project itself. And that has some really interesting implications, in particular there's some demand in California for this \u2013 it's really an ultrapure form of gasoline. So we're going to evaluate that hand-in-hand with OCI as we look forward and figure it out.","In the U.S., though, principally most of methanol production is currently used in formaldehyde and acetic acid processes, it's not used that much for energy currently in the U.S., but there is that optionality. Although I got to say we're big fans of the ethanol market, we're supporting the corn growers in ethanol.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, very fair.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Dan Swenson. You may begin.","Daniel Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I am Dan Swenson, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. And with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its fourth quarter 2013 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news release that's posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com, and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed on Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time-to-time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","Anthony Will","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be with you today and honored to have the opportunity to take over the leadership of CF Industries from Steve Wilson. Steve left an exceptional legacy of creating shareholder value, one that I am fully committed to build upon.","I'll come back to the topic of just how we intend to continue creating shareholder value later in the call. But first, I want to review our fourth quarter and full year results.","We Generated $643 million of EBITDA in the quarter, representing 48% of our revenues. This capped the year, in which we generated $2.7 billion of EBITDA or 49% of our full year revenues. These results highlight the cash flow generation capability of our business, even during difficult market conditions.","During the fourth quarter, our view of the global urea supply curve was yet again validated. In October, urea price has bottomed out at the global floor, based on the level where marginal producers were estimated to be breakeven on a cash cost basis. In this case, that was Chinese anthracite coal-based production. This forced even higher cost producers in Europe and other regions to take downtime.","Prices began to recover after the Chinese low-tariff export window closed and global supply tightened as demand emerged. Prices continue to move up in December, as the market needed to bid some of the high cost European production back online to meet global demand requirements.","This quarter again demonstrated that the nitrogen industry continues to be driven by free market economics, where cash cost forced all market participants to make rational economic business decisions. CF Industries is able to generate significant amount of sustainable cash flows due to three factors.","The first, the structural cost advantage we enjoyed based on North American natural gas cost compared to hydrocarbon feedstock cost in other production regions of the world. The second, our expensive network of production, logistical and distribution assets, which create synergies and opportunities for us that no other nitrogen company enjoys. And the third, our experienced and high-performing team.","Several people have commented in the past that we are the best nitrogen operators in the world, and that was demonstrated again this quarter, as we performed extremely well in difficult market conditions and still generated $643 million of EBITDA.","2013 began with a cold, wet spring over much in North America, which led to delayed planting and application season. These conditions proved difficult for ammonia, but favored our upgraded products. The delayed planting in turn led to a late harvest, which shortened the fall ammonia application season. As a result, ammonia sales volumes and prices for 2013 were significantly lower than 2012 levels.","2013 certainly had its share of challenges. A difficult ammonia market because of weather, a difficult urea environment in the second half of the year, and particularly in the fourth quarter, when the Chinese low-tariff export window was open, and the result in price pressure on UAN, given where ammonia and urea were trading. However, despite all of that, our team here at CF Industries was still able to deliver $2.7 billion of EBITDA for the year, our third best year ever.","As I mentioned at the start of the call, we are committed to driving long-term shareholder value, which we measure in terms of total shareholder return. Our approach to this is really pretty simple. We are focused on maximizing the cash flow generation capabilities per share of stock, while we seek to lower the cost of financing the enterprise.","The strategic decisions we make are governed by that framework. We invest in projects to grow our cash flow generation, when those projects have return profiles well above our cost of capital, while we actively reduce our share count.","So now I'd like to highlight some of the key strategic accomplishments in both the fourth quarter and for all of 2013. In terms of growing our cash flow generation capability, in April, we completed the acquisition of Viterra's interest in our Medicine Hat facility, which increased our cash flow capacity by retaining 270,000 tons of net ammonia and 275,000 tons of urea that previously went to our former partner.","During the year we completed or approved high-return projects to add approximately 100,000 tons of ammonia capacity across our system. All of this additional production volume will be online in 2014. We've also made great progress on our expansion projects in Louisiana and Iowa, which together increase our production capacity by 25%, when they will be completed in 2015 and 2016.","During the year permits were issued and significant progress was made on civil construction at both sites. By the end of 2013, general construction contracts were in place for four of the five production plants, and work had been started under lump sum turn-key contracts for supporting infrastructure, including urea warehouses and ammonia storage tanks at both locations. We're very confident in our teams that are executing these projects, which continue to be on schedule and on budget.","In addition to the deployment of capital to increase our long-term cash flow generation, we repurchased over 7 million shares during the year, representing 12% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of 2013. This reduction in share count increased the cash flow generation on a per share basis to our remaining stockholders. Additionally, we increased our dividend 150% to $1 per share per quarter.","We also sharpened our focus on reducing our cost of capital during 2013, a key step of which was our inaugural issuance of investment grade debt. Maintaining our investment grade rating is a critical element of our financing strategy, as it gives us access to exceptionally low cost long-term capital, while also allowing us the flexibility to pursue value-creating initiatives.","Other key accomplishments during the quarter were the strategic agreements we executed with the Mosaic Company. We are selling our phosphate business in order to redeploy that capital in ways that will create more value for CF shareholders than if we had continued to hold and operate that business.","Additionally, we have put in place ammonia supply agreement, which provide long-term steady demand for a financially strong customer. The ammonia has been priced with a defined margin that supports our belief in the mid-teens return profile for the capacity expansion projects.","I am now going to turn the call over to Bert, to provide a deeper discussion of the nitrogen market conditions and our operations during the quarter. Bert?","Bert Frost","Thanks, Tony. Global nitrogen market condition is challenging during the fourth quarter. The industry had to deal with declining corn prices, unfavorable regional weather conditions in North America and excess global nitrogen supply. These factors were all weighing on nitrogen prices, as they hit the floor in the October time period.","The ammonia market had a difficult set of dynamics during the quarter, as the late North American harvest and early cold weather resulted in a short fall application season. Inventory carryover from the spring and high production levels contributed to elevated industry-wide inventory and led to a weak ammonia pricing environment.","Coming into the quarter, the global urea market saw prices under pressure from a significant level of Chinese urea exports during their low tariff export season. The price pressure from the high level of urea supply had an impact on the UAN market as well. Urea and UAN prices at the U.S. Gulf found a floor in October and moved in a narrow band through November, as buyers sat on the sidelines, waiting to take inventory positions.","Then during December, seasonal events started to emerge. The close of the low-tariff Chinese export window and gas curtailments in areas like Libya, Egypt and Pakistan limited available supply. Given the tightening of the global supply demand situation and grower and retailer recognition of their low inventory positions, prices started moving up.","This was evidenced, as average urea prices at the U.S. Gulf increased from $285 in October to nearly $330 in December, and as high as $425 in late January. We operated well in this changing environment by managing our order book to maximize the pricing options available to us. The decisions we made were supported by data-driven analysis of agricultural and fertilizer business trends, the evaluation of global market conditions and the excise of management discretion.","We believe that these are part of the operational excellence that continues to differential CF Industries from our competitors. Recognize that the weak market situation in October\/November did not reflect the value of our products and the ultimate demand we were confident of seeing, but we chose to be conservative with our order books during that time.","In anticipation of conditions for more favorable pricing, our teams positioned our inventory and logistical assets for what was a record selling December, as we made sales into recovering markets. We utilized exports to manage our inventory levels and to take advantage of sales opportunities with attractive netback pricing. This included exporting ammonia to Morocco, ammonium nitrate to Central and South America, UAN to Argentina and Urea to Chile. As we move into 2014, we have seen pricing conditions continue to improve.","Demand for nitrogen continues to be strong with high acres planted globally. We expect planting of 92 million acres of corn in North America will support the need to import a significant amount of nitrogen in order to meet spring demand. In that environment, we will operate our plant to full capacity and so all of our production. The timing of these sales will be driven by opportunities to maximize our margins.","Since July, North America has had lower imports of urea compared to last year, contributing to tight regional markets. This situation has been reflected in U.S. Gulf prices for urea, which have rebounded to around $420 a ton recently from the October 2013 average of about $285.","UAN demand is also expected to be strong. With reduced import and inventory relative to last year, UAN prices will likely have to move up in order to attract imports to satisfy overall demand.","The strength urea and UAN should also have a beneficial impact on ammonia demand, as buyers recognize the compelling value ammonia provides to them. Due to oversupply ammonia prices are much lower per pound at end, so on a value basis ammonia should have a robust spring consumption weather permitting.","Looking forward into 2014, we expect to see a less volatile pricing environment due to the change in the Chinese urea export tariff policy. With a change in the tariff policy to reduce the export tariff during the high season, we expect to see more Chinese product come on to the global market in the November to June time period, when price is supported.","For the full year, we expect about 8 million tons of exports, which is similar to last year. While this supply may reduce some of the peaks in urea prices, we believe we also be conducive to more ratable purchasing and a greater pricing efficiency across the market. We've seen some evidence of this already with the increase in prices fall in the October close of the low-tariff season and with Chinese producers appearing to maximize their profits across domestic and export sales.","Now, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks, Bert, and good morning, everyone. Our financial results for the quarter and full year demonstrate the robust cash generation capacity of our business as measured by EBITDA. During the quarter it was characterized by very difficult market conditions. We generated $643 million of EBITDA, which was 48% of our $1.3 billion of revenue.","For the year, we generated $24.74 of earnings per share and $2.7 billion of EBITDA, which was 49% of our $5.5 billion of revenue. This level of earnings was in part attributable to the enduring structural advantage provided by low-cost North American natural gas.","We've been watching the gas market very closely, given the exceptionally cold winter weather we've experienced in North America and are encouraged by the relatively stable nature of the natural gas forward curve, even with several recent weeks of record gas storage withdrawals.","We are actively managing our near-term risk exposure to natural gas prices. We have hedged approximately 75% of our first quarter NYMEX exposure and 50% of our second quarter NYMEX exposure at prices well below $4 per MMBtu. Our plants are primarily in gas producing regions, which over time helps minimize the impact on our business of differentials to NYMEX prices.","We are using the cash generated by our business on a select use strategic priority. We spent $129 million of cash on our capital expansion projects during the quarter, which bought our total cash capital expenditures on the project to $356 million for the year. We accrued an additional $204 million at yearend, bringing our total investment in the projects during 2013 to $560 million. We also had $468 million of capital expenditures during 2013 for items other than our capital expansion projects.","These expenditures that provided approximately 100,000 tons of incremental ammonia production capacity, additional transportation logistics infrastructure, expanded storage capacity, and most importantly has help maintained the safe operating condition of our assets. We returned $395 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and the repurchase of 1.5 million shares at an average price of $223 per share.","Our financial objectives in 2014 will be focused on closing the phosphate sale, putting in place lower cost capital in the form of long-term debt and continuing to return cash to shareholders by our repurchases and dividend. We expect to close the sale of phosphate business some time in the first half of 2014 and to realize approximately $1 billion of proceeds net of tax. We also intend to raise up to $1.5 billion of additional debt in early 2014.","We are focused on realizing the lowest cost of capital for the overall enterprise, while maintaining our commitment to investment grade credit metrics. We believe this approach provides us with several significant benefits and a superior hand to execute a variety of strategic initiative on a timeframe that we can manage.","It allows us to pay dividend, buyback shares, deploy cash towards growth opportunities, all without significant restrictions and it allows us ready access to long-term financing for the capital markets. Therefore, we are fully committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit metrics.","We are making progress in our evaluation of optimizing the capital structure of the company, including how MLPs might fit within that framework. Early indication suggests that the sale of existing operating assets to an MLP does not look terribly compelling to other alternatives such as additional low cost debt. Our existing assets have low tax bases, which would create tax leakage significantly reducing the net proceeds realized from selling them to an MLP.","Additionally, the cash flows from these operating assets support CFs investment-grade metrics and our current and planned borrowings. However, our analyses are not complete and we continue to evaluate alternative funding options for the company.","Another of our key objective is to continue to buyback shares and return cash to shareholders. To that end, through Friday, we have purchased approximately 700,000 shares at an average price of $230 per share for a total of a $162 million since the beginning of the year.","We currently have approximately 55 million shares outstanding and $1.4 billion of remaining repurchase authorization. In addition, we will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of our dividend level overtime.","With that, Tony, will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","Anthony Will","We recently announced entering into a long-term agreement with Orica to be their primary external supplier in North America for industrial-grade ammonium nitrate and AN solutions. This agreement will provide an off-take for about 70% to 80% of the AN production from our Yazoo City complex and shifts our customer base more heavily towards industrial AN and away from agricultural AN.","The agreement is structured in a somewhat similar way to the Mosaic Ammonia Supply Agreement and that we have a defined margin structure with an attractive return profile and a steady long-term customer that is a leader its industry. This agreement will help us to realize significant value from our Yazoo City complex.","I also want to provide some insight into other work we are currently doing. We realized a significant premium per unit of nitrogen for urea compared to ammonia, particularly in the regions served by our Medicine Hat facility, combined with a difficult ammonia market conditions presented by the shortened application season this year. This helps us evaluating options for upgrading more of our ammonia at Medicine Hat. It is early stages at this point, but as our analysis progresses, we will provide you updates.","I would like to thank all our employees, especially our sales, sales support and logistics team for doing a truly great job in December. Their efforts allowed us to end the year on a high note.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","I think I just heard Dennis make a comment about not dropping down existing plants into an MLP, which I assume meant TNH. You didn't mention anything about what you might do MLP-wise with the two new facilities or if you're not going to do additional dropdowns into TNH, what why you might do with the general partner interest there or with the substantial amount of common units that you'll miss. So maybe you could give us some preliminary thoughts on how you're thinking about all those things.","Dennis Kelleher","What I would point out is in our prepared remarks, what I stated was our analyses is going to be a detailed analysis, that we're doing, is not yet complete. If you go back to what we've talked about in the past, we are doing a detailed analysis that will involve, looking at everything on an asset-by-asset basis and looking at all the options, potential contract structures and the like, that one produce to do an MLP. So what I've given today is really just a preliminary view of kind of where we come out on some of the existing assets. We will of course be looking at all of those things over time.","With respect to the assets that we're building at this point in time, again, that will be part of the analysis as well. When we'll have our conclusions later in the year, we'll conclusions at least on a preliminary basis on those. But I think it's worth pointing out that with respect to the new assets, there isn't anything to do with those things until sometime in 2016 or 2017 when they're completed. So it would be difficult to have a final conclusion on those until such time, as they're right to be sold to an MLP, if that were an option, we wanted to pursue.","Anthony Will","The other thing that I would throw in there, Vincent, is relative to the TNH position that we currently hold, we've got much lower cost ways currently of generating additional liquidity into business. And in particular, we're talking about raising $1.5 billion of additional debt here in the short term, which the cost of which is pretty minor on an after-tax basis.","First us to sell additional TNH units, we're really selling cash flow from the C Corp shareholders. So we're absolutely looking at that like any other divestiture and can we realize more value by selling that cash flow out in the market versus keeping it for our shareholders. And right now as we look at on a net realized cash basis, the answer is no. It makes sense for us to keep that cash flow and deploy it against our business priorities. So where we stand today, we have no real interest in selling TNH units in the market.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","And as a follow-up, I'm not sure what your goal is, but any idea, how much of your volume do you think you could transition into the type of structure that you've done with Mosaic and with Orica?","Bert Frost","I think where we are with that I would carry on with what Dennis presented relative to MLP. We are looking at various options for our product flows, and again to maximize the return to the corporation over time. And so yes, there are opportunities out there for us, but we have to still review those and come to a conclusion with the management team, the direction that we will go. But I would just say, more as it develops.","Anthony Will","Vincent, from a philosophical standpoint, aligning our production with leaders in the industry spaces that they occupy that are high-credit, longstanding, strong participants in their industry to us makes great business sense, and we're really walking up from strategic partnerships. And so as Bert said, we'll have to evaluate these on a case-by-case basis. But where we've got those kind of intersections of interest and value delivery that we can provide, I think it's a win-win for both sides.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A couple of questions, first of all on ammonia, I think you indicated that you ran at an operating rate of 107%, so it's not often we see rates that high. Can you comment on why you ran so hard and how the incremental 100 tons is factoring into that calculation? And also why you would have run that hard, when it sounds like producer inventory of ammonia is a bit elevated? And then secondly, just wondering if you could comment on inventory levels for UAN solutions and urea, please?","Anthony Will","So I'll take the first part of that, Kevin, and then I'll turn it over to Bert. So when we report ammonia capacity, we do it on an average over the cycle. And by a cycle it's usually a four-year cycle, because most of our ammonia plants are on a four year turnaround cycle, which means that you sort of have one week outage per year. And so that's factored into the average capacity numbers that we report. And so in a quarter, when we don't have significant downtime or turnaround activity, and we're able to run at something above 100%.","But it's also true that some of the debottleneck projects that are adding 100,000 tons of ammonia capacity were completed during the year and some of that additional capacity is showing up in our production numbers. In terms of why we would want to do that, even though producer inventories are historically a bit higher than they've been in the last couple of years, the margin structure that's available to us is still extraordinary.","When our cash cost of ammonia production is in the neighborhood of $150 to $170 basis on a Gulf basis and we're selling product in the interior north of 500, we want to produce every ton we possibly can, because we're very comfortable that those tons will eventually find their way to ground. And when they do, we will have made great margin as a result of that. Relative to the inventory position, I'll turn that over to Bert.","Bert Frost","First, the CFs, we ended up the year, as we mentioned in our release as well as during this discussion, ammonia was challenged throughout the fourth quarter, I'd say really challenged since the start of the fertilizer year. We did well in terms of moving our product and recognize the difficult environment that we entered in November and that's why you saw us export ammonia in the fourth quarter.","We ended the quarter or ended 2013 relatively solid on our inventory levels for ammonia, but probably higher than we would prefer. For urea and UAN they were both below our three-year average, and again we think we managed that well through various options that are available to us in order to end up in an acceptable position to start 2014.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then as a follow-up, if I may, on natural gas, do you have any hedges in place for the back half of the year? And then I just had, I guess, a clarification, your press release indicates you've got exposure to floating basis differentials for gas at some production points, so wondering if you could just elaborate and explain what the impact of that or implication could be?","Dennis Kelleher","With respect to the hedges that we've got on, Kevin, what we explained in the press release was, we had the first quarter hedged at 75% and second quarter hedged at 50%, and that's the best, that's our disclosure that we have. With respect to basis differentials, really that affects us principally, and this is only a time that two plants, that there is in Iowa and also at our Courtright plant in Canada. We've got some hedging with respect to basis differentials at the Canada plant.","But at the end of day, this isn't a big deal for us because over time, like I've said in the prepared remarks our plants really sit in gas producing regions. And so basis differentials, as a rule generally don't terribly out of line, and so consequently, although, yes, this does affect our results to a degree, but the affect on our results is not gigantic by any means.","Anthony Will","Kevin, the mechanisms around basis differential is the NYMEX is basically priced at Henry Hub. So when we're buying gas, we're buying it at the Hub and to the extent there is transportation differences that then swapped out for gas, delivered into Port Neal, Iowa. There is basically transportation cost is not hedged, that's what the basis differential is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","A question for Bert. Bert, you talked about strong outlook this spring, especially for urea and UAN. So I'm wondering why you were so active in export market in the fourth quarter, when you have been better off sort of inventorying that product and selling it into the domestic market, especially given the potential for logistical constraints and how that works to your advantage?","And next, one longer-term question. Slide 9, you've got your projection of the North American nitrogen import situations through 2018. How many new greenfield plants and\/or major brownfield expansions are you putting into that supply demand and import balance outlook.","Anthony Will","Regarding the spring outlook, obviously today it's fairly rosy. We were pretty confident in what we had positioned and what we believe will materialize through the second quarter. The high insight is 2020. We did not have that view in the fourth quarter, which was a fairly challenging environment where you saw urea, I think in the releases, at $275, maybe $285 for an average. But the floor was fairly low. And with the outlook, that continued production would be coming to the United States.","And so you have taken balance, that's what we do at least is balance our options, and so during that time period, in order to be prudent with our order book, we've decided to export through key train through to a number of countries, throughout South America, Central America and Europe to move our products on, I would say, judicious spaces, which allowed us to maintain our inventory levels through an acceptable position, but during that time period, also building inventory to allow us to capture the December increase as well as the Q1 pricing environment that we have today.","So when you look at the exports and how we acted in the market, it was with that intent to balance the options available to the company and position it in what we thought would be the best position.","Regarding the greenfield and brownfield, Don, on the new plants what we're assuming is that there is basically four new greenfield plants and including in that are the projects at Port Neil and Donaldsonville that we're doing, even though those are brownfield. And then we've got several capacity expansion projects embedded in there from the majors.","It's principally Agrium, PCS, Koch that have announced and we believe those are real projects that are moving forward. Most of the other projects that have been talked about at this point we don't see having any sort of significant production volume, even if were they to occur in the 2018 time horizon. So if they show up, their impact is really going to be '19 and beyond.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","I wanted just to follow up on that. You show about 5 million nutrient tons of net import demand in North America in 2018. How would you see that unfolding by 2020? Do you think it goes away by then or do you think that we remain -- our North America remains a net nitrogen importer?","Anthony Will","We believe it will be remained a net nitrogen importer. I think what you've seen are the people that are already in this business that have assets and networks that they can leverage to get the most bang for new steel in the ground are the ones most likely to make investments.","And you've seen projects cancelled by a number of those participants. So our view is while there maybe a one or more projects that eventually show up, it's a pretty long thought for a lot of new entrants to get there. And so we believe North America will continue to be a nitrogen import region for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Korn of Barclays.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","I'll ask a little bit of I guess a market question. I'm just wondering if farmers, given the turn that we've seen in expected income levels go into next year, is there anything behaviorally changing as to how they're buying? Are they being more aggressive on last $5, $10 a ton, are they being more discretionary in winter purchases at all that you can tell.","Bert Frost","It's an interesting question, because yes that has taken place with buyer behavior. We see the farmer behavior representing the retailer ability or desire to take positions. And so what you have is the market is operating today with a very short cycle. The farmers have not stepped-in. And for fall, I'd think they've bought a portion of their requirements, but there's still a high percentage still to be purchased.","And what has happened as the retailers are backing up, they haven't been buying as much as what we've seen in the past. And so we believe that that will show itself or materialize in a very active April -- maybe March and April period when people will have to stepped-in and cover their spring requirements.","Part of that behavior is represented in risk. Again, there's both farmer and retailer are not desiring to take on a tremendous amount of risk and we happened to participate in very volatile market these days with the urea prices spiking $50 a week at times. And so we understand that and that's why we're preparing the way that we do to utilize our inventory space, as I mentioned earlier, our export options and the various methods that we come to the market.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","Following-up for Dennis, back in December, you put out a really nice chart, kind of outlining over 2014, 2016, your kind of available capital versus your expected uses of capital. And if I read that correctly, that implied maybe around like $2 billion and $2.5 billion in capital, above and beyond your current commitments.","It talks a little bit about the opportunity maybe to do some upgrading at Medicine Hat, when do you think we'd hear more over the course of the year about whether we would see a lift in repurchase expectations or any other type of growth investment?","Dennis Kelleher","I would say, again, the framework that we used is to the extent that we've got projects that return well above our cost of capital than we're interested in deploying cash against those. And to the extent, we don't, we're focused on returning cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","And as mentioned, we're still sort of early stages on the Medicine Hat analysis, but we will be providing regular updates to that on calls as we go and I don't want to put a time horizon on it, or a definitive decision on that. But we should be able to make some pretty significant progress on that during the course of the year.","Operator","And your next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citi.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","Your customer advances on the balance sheet were much lower than last year. I was wondering if you could explain that, part of that could be price of urea and other products, so can you break down the decline with how much is lower volume versus how much is lower price?","Dennis Kelleher","PJ, we usually don't get into disclosing kind of what we have in terms of volumes, in respect of our customer advances. But I would say this year, that we have a significantly lower volume in terms of our forward pricing program, which generates the customer advances than we've had in previous years. And obviously, you've got price pressure too, this year versus in the end of year last year. Bert, if you've got anything more, you want to add in terms of color on the market.","Bert Frost","I think it's both, Dennis. I think what you've seen is, just to take ammonia for example, we were last year around the $700 level and that is today around the $500 level. And that's representing each of the products. As well as volume is probably a little bit lower, but not much as compared to previous years. You have to prepare for spring ammonia by pre-purchasing or pre-allocating where those tons will go. And that takes time for us as well as the other producers. And so in order to prepare for that we have to sell.","And I think we are adequately positioned on our order book with UAN and urea. But there is a reflection as, I said earlier, that customers have been hesitated to take, I would say, three to four months out forward positions. And we're okay with where the market is today in relative to that decision.","Anthony Will","And PJ part of that too is was a very conscious decision that Bert and his team used to manage our forward order book to the extent that we believe we're moving into a period of relative strength, our appetite for taking on a lot of forward orders is diminished.","And when we find levels that we're very happy with in terms of our margins that are available to us, then we'll go ahead and take more of that. So as we were coming out of the pretty difficult environment in the fourth quarter, moving into what we expected to be a brighter spring, it's not surprising that our forward order book would be lower.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","And then secondly, the Chinese exported over 8 million tons of urea last year. So Tony, when you look at 2014 given the changes in tariff structure, how much export do you expect? And then is there a bottleneck in port, and can they export more from their existing infrastructure?","Anthony Will","Yes. We're expecting somewhere in the same zip code about 8 million tons again. I would say, to the extent that prices on the global market rise significantly above what their other alternatives are, you'll see them find ways to get around port congestion and so forth, and that those tons will find their way out in the market.","As Bert mentioned in his prepared remarks that may put out a little bit of a feeling just on how high urea prices rise during the year, but even with that out, there we're still generating the huge amount of cash based on our business model with the advantages that we have. So we feel very comfortable with the marketplace and the environment we're operating in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","Maybe first, Bert, if you could reflect on the recent move in urea prices, UAN has moved up as well, maybe not as quickly, and narrowed some of that premium that you saw really developed over 2013. Can you give us some thoughts on how do you think that's going to play out over 2014? And why does any premium UAN can carryover urea, as you go into the spring?","Bert Frost","I think where we are today, relative to the imports that have come in, the demand we expect from 92 million acres of corn as well as the other feed grains and fiber, we are expecting healthy demand and that needs to be met by a combination of imports and domestically produced products. So urea prices today is, as I mentioned around $420 for spot products, even getting as high as $430.","And you can read different industry projections or predictions, but we do see a healthy urea environment, and if are under -- continue under the import level, we could even see a spike. UAN will accompany that. They do trade in relation to each other, but at times they separated. As you mentioned last year, that was the case where urea or UAN traded at a healthy premium. We expect those premiums to be maintained. I won't give you an exact range, but UAN is a preferred product. It's a great product for corn and we're expecting demand to be solid.","Anthony Will","Adam, the one other thing I would add there is we're expecting robust demand on ammonia. But the key there is weather permitting to the extent that we have a spring like we had last year. It's going to diminish the number of tons that can actually hit the ground before the farmers want to get in the field. If that were to occur, the value of our credit product system is that much higher. And so you'd see in that case the premium for UAN spike even higher. So we're well-positioned, whichever way the weather takes the spring application season.","Bert Frost","And if you look at last year at the end of 2013 in Q4 for what the industry or the TFI or the industry projections came out, and how much reduced the ammonia application was, there is a significant amount that needs to be made up in the spring. And I think that's difficult to do, because you have logistical complications, and we know how our assets run and how hard our distribution assets run during the application period. And it's a matter of days to dump those and to try to fill as much as you can for the second round. But I think it's going to be a challenge to meet the ammonia demand this spring.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","And maybe on Tony's point, you've had two consecutive disappointing ammonia application seasons in the Midwest. If the weather doesn't cooperate in the next couple of months, how does the distribution chain really handle that as you get into the summer?","I mean, is it really, product has to stay at the Gulf and they'll will be exported, because there is just no room in the Midwest anymore to take additional tons? Or can you talk through on kind of the applications, if you have a third consecutive disappointing ammonia season?","Bert Frost","I think you have taken a relative sense. We will have an ammonia season, and it's difficult, it's in the margin of how much is not applied. So if we were to take, let's say, the ammonia market for the year, there is 4 million tons to 4.5 million tons and if 10% of that is not applied, that's 400,000 tons, but that represents a lot of urea and UAN on an end-basis. And so if we don't have, specifically looking at CF Industries, if we are unable to maximize ammonia applications, you're exactly right, we will make decisions to balance our system.","And in sometimes, that's bringing product in from the north and that's one of reasons why we're looking at Medicine Hat for upgrades, because that difficulties tend to happen in the Dakotas or Canada for ammonia applications on limited season. And then we rebalance. We can bring product into the Gulf, or we can bring product up through the pipe, or we can export it, but the goal for us is to maintain a balance. We're not having to dump product at an uneconomical way.","Anthony Will","Adam, that's one of the huge benefits that we have with our network having Donaldsonville where it is, because we can export ammonia out of D'ville in a way that very few of our competitors have the option of being able to do. And given where North American gas cost is we can do that very profitably and still make good margin on that those export tons. So again, we've got some levers and some flexibility that other people just don't have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the Tim Tiberio of Miller Tabak.","Tim Tiberio - Miller Tabak","I just circle back through the long-term supply outlook. I believe Pemex announced that they are looking to restart a brownfield site in Mexico over the next two years. I just wanted to get a sense of whether that is factored into your North American import and supply outlook?","Bert Frost","Generally speaking, even though from a geographic perspective, Mexico is part of North America. When we talk about North America, we're principally talking U.S. and Canada. And the Pemex project those tons will likely stay in Mexico and really be kicking out imports in Mexico from other areas. So we don't see that project having a real significant S&D impact on the U.S. and Canada. We maybe should be able a little more precise when we say North America and talk about U.S. and Canada.","Dennis Kelleher","Tim, the other thing I'd point out is, globally if you look at the long-term mix and you see it growing at about 2% per year. And so globally you're going to need, we believe, between 4% and 5% among the urea complexes to be built every year just to keep up the demand. So while PMX maybe doing that, other people will shutdown, some other stuff will get build. We tend to take a look at these types of things and put them in the global context.","Unidentified Analyst","And then secondly, can you disclose the net volume increase from this or supply agreement from Orica, I believe if I'm correct, they were an existing customer?","Anthony Will","They are our current customer. We have an agreement with them that is winding up sort of back-to-back with when the new one kicks off. And as we mentioned in the press release that the new agreement will consume about 70% to 80% of Yazoo City total production capacity, which is ballpark about 1 million tons of ammonium nitrate, and that is up substantially.","And with this agreement, we're moving more focused on the industrial AN segment and more away from the agricultural land segment. So this is a pretty significant increase in terms of the volume that we'll be supplying to them going forward. But the terms, the details of the existing contract are confidential. So we can't really get into the volumes and so forth of the existing one.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, as far as magnitude to, could you at least give us some perspective of whether this is double volumes or some type of range, so we can at least get a sense of magnitude?","Dennis Kelleher","Yes. It's in that range.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Just very quickly, you recently executed some longer-term deals for both ammonia and a substantial portion of your nitrate production. Do you have any general long-term goals regarding your ideal mix of contract versus spot cargos or these simply are opportunistic?","Anthony Will","I would say these are more opportunistic. We had the chance to be able to align ourselves with some long-term agreements with defined margins, irrespective of where gas is traded, and with some real industry leaders in the segment that they're in. And when we climb those kind of situations, it's really a marriage made in heaven, because it's a win-win for both us as a supplier and our customer having guaranteed reliable supply. And so if we find more opportunities like that we will execute them, but otherwise we feel very comfortable with our ability to participate in the spot market and take advantage of that.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","And just a quick derivative question on that, if all these contracts have defined margins independent of net gas cost, longer volatility of cash flows, et cetera. Will this eventually or potentially have any varying on your thought of, let's say, putting out a more decisive payout ratio for your dividend going forward. I understand certainly, but just any general thoughts as how you may think about that would be appreciated?","Anthony Will","I think we are constantly evaluating our dividend and it's certainly something. When we raised it to 150% in 2013, we have kind of targeted a mid S&P kind of yield, which is about 2% or just under. Obviously, our stock price has gone up considerably since then. So we're well under that, which is a good reason to be under it, with our stock price appreciating.","But I think it's something we continue to evaluate and whether the S&P averages the right one or the industry sector averages the right target, we have robust discussions about it. I would say where we're at right now, we have a lot of moving pieces this year. We have $2.5 billion of CapEx, including $2 billion towards our capacity expansion projects. We've got the sale of the phosphate business. We've got up to $1.5 billion of additional debt.","So there is a lot of ins and out. And in that context we kind of want to get to probably a bit more stable place before we do something radical with the dividend. But I think it's fair to say that overtime our objectives would be to increase it. And the other piece of moving ins and out is the additional $1.4 billion of share repurchase authorization that's still open. So there is a lot of, as I said, moving pieces, but it's a good question and one that we continue to evaluate around here.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Earlier in the call you talked about mid-teens returns and your sale of ammonias up to Mosaic. Are those mid-teens returns after-tax or pre-tax?","Dennis Kelleher","Jeff, what we were talking about there was the mid-teens returns profiles for the projects generally, and yes, those are after-tax IRRs. If you go back to the presentation that we gave in December, I think there was a table, I'm not sure where it is, but we gave sort of a returns profile for the projects, varying urea price and gas price, and those are after-tax return.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Tony, I was wondering if your philosophy of share repurchase is different from that of Steve. And how do you determine when you should buy more of your stock or less?","Anthony Will","Well, Jeff, I mean that's a great question. And I would say, I don't know that the philosophy is dramatically different that people that are weighing in on that, Bert and Dennis and I are the same group that was here before. I would say, we believe that our shares continue to represent an outstanding value today and we're happy to be buying them. As you saw we bought quite a few of them since the first of the year at prices in the $230 range and our outlook is certainly very robust, particularly as we're looking at having the new capacity expansion projects come on.","That said, I'd always rather buy more at lower prices, but as we mentioned a couple of times now, we are really looking at completing or largely completing our existing authorization by the end of the year. Again, part of that because we believe that our shares are very attractive for our long-term holders that we're taking amount at these kind of levels.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","And then lastly, on AECO gas, really spiked tremendously at the beginning of February, and I think it was up to maybe $16 MMBtu. Was that difficult to cope with or how did you cope with the changes in Canadian gas prices?","Anthony Will","I mean, if you look at the AECO gas differential now, as you can see is back down for March. In AECO we're sort of buying daily and during that period of time we did look at whether we should curtail ammonia production a little bit. And in fact, given the difficult ammonia market, as Bert said, when there is a tough ammonia market, it's usually in Canada and the Dakotas, principally because it's already a short application window anyway.","And when it was even further shortened the inventories were getting that big. So we actively look at where gas is trading on a daily basis, where our inventory position is, and we did go ahead and turned down our ammonia plant during that period of high gas price to help cope with that.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Tony Will for any closing remarks.","Anthony Will","Thank you to everyone for participating in today's earnings conference call. Our business model was really tested in the fourth quarter and during all of 2013, and it was again proven to be robust. We are confident in the sustainability and magnitude of the operating cash flow generation capacity of this company, which are underpinned by our three competitive advantages, our cost structure compared to the industry, our operating asset network and our experience and high-performing team.","With these strategic advantages that no other nitrogen company enjoys, we are actively executing a strategy we believe will increase the value of CF Industries. We are investing in high-return projects that are growing the underlying cash generation potential represented by each share. We are actively reducing our outstanding share count and we are putting in place lower cost of capital for the company.

My name is Justin and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We'll facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Martin Jarosick with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin Jarosick","Good morning. And thanks for joining the CF Industries\u2019 First Quarter Earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President, Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market development and Supply Chain and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its first quarter 2019 results yesterday afternoon.","On this call, we'll review the CF Industries\u2019 results in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session. Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

More detailed information about the factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC that are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","Tony Will","Thanks, Martin. And good morning everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $305 million after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. We're really pleased with this performance, especially against the backdrop of another first quarter with cold and wet weather that delayed the application season even more so than last year.","Despite lower sales volumes we exceeded our first quarter adjusted EBITDA from last year as selling prices were significantly higher for urea, UAN, NAN. We also operated extremely well. We set a quarterly production record for urea and ammonia production was our third highest ever. Most importantly, we continue to work safely as our rolling 12-month recordable incident rate remained at 0.6 incidents per 200,000 work hours.","As we have said many times in the past we plan our business on a six-month increment. Weather patterns may move product shipments out of one quarter and into another but we run our plants 24\/7, 365 and over the course of the year, we're going to ship everything we make. We believe this year will be no different. April saw much improved shipments and we are now ahead of where we were a year ago on volume.","As Bert will outline shortly, we expect high demand for nitrogen due to increased corn acres in the United States amplified by low ammonia applications last fall. At the same time, we expect continued disruptions to barge and rail transportation due to the lingering effects of weather. This is tested in the industries logistics capabilities to move upgraded products to farmers, when and where they needed. We believe these challenges plays right into our strengths. We have significant in region production, unparalleled logistics capabilities and an expansive distribution network, these position us well as the spring application season progresses.","Longer term, these same operational advantages, along with our structural advantage of operating in an import dependent region and our access to low cost North American natural gas will continue to drive our cash generation capability.","Before I turn it over to Bert, I want to comment on the expected impacts of the European Commission's announcement of provisional duties on imports of UAN. We strongly disagree with the Commission's conclusions, which we believe ignore the market fundamentals of the globally traded commodities like UAN. See our purchase is natural gas our primary input at prevailing market prices. We use that in our highly efficient plants to produce UAN and then sell it at prevailing market prices.","The key difference between CS and Eastern European producers is that we have newer, more efficient, more reliable, more climate-friendly and lower GHG plants than they did. We also have access to low cost North American natural gas. That said, we fully expect that these duties will impact global UAN trade flows and that will take some time for the industry to adjust.","Fortunately, CF has more options than many others. And we have been taking appropriate steps to mitigate the financial impact to our company. We exported roughly 850,000 tons of UAN to Europe last year, and this is how we think about realigning those tons going forward. We'll make more granular urea unless UAN which will absorb between 300,000 to 700,000 tons of that depending upon the specific production mix decisions we make.","We continued to build demand in South America and leverage our relationships there and so we expect to increase our exports into that region. Finally, in the last six months we have leased additional access to UAN space within North America. Based on those, based on these actions that Burt and Chris and their teams have taken, we can easily realign those tons that we previously sent to Europe without a significant financial impact.","In the short term we also benefit from an increase in corn acres in North America which coupled with poor fallout, ammonia applications will significantly increase UAN demand here this year. So net-net we're well prepared to deal with the loss of access to the European market.","With that let me turn it over to Bert who will talk more about the spring application season. Then Dennis will cover a few financial items before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert Frost","Thanks, Tony. As has been well-documented wet and cold weather delayed fertilizer applications in North America. However, in April, the weather was favorable for field work and fertilizer applications currently as well in the Midwest and field work has slowed. Over the past several weeks, we saw significant activity at many terminals from Eastern Nebraska to Western Illinois and Northern Missouri. To give you a sense of the movement on one day in April our Albany Illinois term loaded 263 trucks. To do this the loaded trucks for 24 hours straight for more than 5,000 tons of ammonia at just one terminal. And this week urea truck shipments of Port Neal reached nearly 10,000 tons in one day, a record for the facility. Applications have begun to shift North and East more recently as would be expected.","In fact CF ammonia shipments are now ahead of last year's pace. We continue to expect nitrogen demand in North America to be strong during the first half of the year, driven by an increase in planted corn acres in the United States. And though, we have had a late spring it is not too late for farmers to catch up on applications and plantings giving the technology they use. If farmers switch to other end products, we have all three ready in position. As of this week corn plantings run pace with 2018. We also anticipate strong demand for upgraded products this spring in order to make up for the lighter than normal fall 2018 ammonia applications.","We believe the industry's ability to supply all this volume and the timing manner will be challenged. Most significantly barge transportation has been disrupted by the after effects of the winter and spring rain. Barges are moving slowly and we don't expect regular access to Minneapolis for a couple of weeks. This is the latest opening and at least 30 years.","This has two effects. First, prompt urea barges in Orleans so far into the second quarter have been in high demand. Barge need to be moving north for spring applications. Pricing is reflected this has no urea barges pricing approach $300 last week before retreating this week to 270. Second, product already in region is trading at a significant premium to Norway barge prices. CFS then it sort of from this from this due to that our strong production at our Port Neal facility, and inventory and position. We have also leveraged Donaldsonville logistics flexibility by railing urea into the upper Midwest in anticipation of the high demand. All of these factors should enable us to capture higher prices across most segments, compared to the second quarter of last year.","The first quarter was challenging because of the weather, but these challenges play into our company's strengths. We're well prepared for the next two months and as a team assets and flexibility to meet our customers\u2019 needs.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Kelleher","Thanks, Bert. In the first quarter of 2019 the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $90 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. EBITDA was $301 million and adjusted EBITDA was $305 million. Our first quarter 2019 net earnings of $0.40 per diluted share included $0.13 per share net income tax benefit. This was the result of the net income tax credit of $30 million recognized during the quarter.","As Tony and Bert have described, our results in the quarter were higher than a year ago as higher product price overcame lower sales line, supporting strong cash generation. During the first quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was $306 million. We returned $127 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $60 million to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares and $67 million in dividend payments. Due to the seasonality of the fertilizer business we evaluate our company's performance against our peers on a rolling 12 month basis.","Looking at the most recent period with our reported financials, you can see on Slide 6 the CF generated $1.5 billion operating cash flow in 2018. After deducting capital expenditures and distribution to non-control interest we generated $936 million, significantly higher than our peers in both an absolute sense and as a percentage of our April 30, 2019 equity market capitalization. This demonstrates CF\u2019s free cash flow, power, which we believe provides ample flexibility to repay $500 million in debt on or before its maturity date in May 2020 and deploy excess cash in line with our longstanding capital allocation philosophy that is to pursue growth within our strategic fairway. And in the absence of these opportunities, return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2019 were $80 million. For the year, we continue to expect this trend before the 450 million.","We end quarter with $671 million of cash on the balance sheet. This does not include $55 million in proceeds received in April from the sale of our Pine Bend dry bulk storage and logistics facility in Minnesota.","With that, Tony will provide closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","Tony Will","Thanks, Dennis. Before I move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work in the first quarter. They operated safely, made the most of the opportunities and helped us to be well positioned for the remainder of the first half of 2019.","When we spoke to you on this call one year ago, our reprices at New Orleans were about to hit the low point of the year at roughly $200 per ton. Today New Orleans barge prices are about $270 per ton and our price for urea in the Midwest is over $370, more than $100 per ton premium, reflecting the logistical challenges the industry sees currently.","We are also benefiting from lower natural gas prices, the cost of natural gas at Henry Hub in the first quarter was lower than a year ago and through the end of 2019, Henry Hub natural gas futures remained well below $3 and below 2018 prices. Added to that is the benefit we received from basis differentials in Alberta and Oklahoma. These factors highlight the operational and structural advantages that we enjoy and that will drive our long-term cash generation capability.","With that operator, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open for questions.","Adam Samuelson","Thanks, good morning everyone.","Tony Will","Good morning.","Adam Samuelson","So I guess I wanted to dig a bit more into the European Union tariffs on UAN, and just the impact both on the company, and you're adjusting and just more high level market impact. In the quarter you've shifted the capacity utilization in the production more heavily to urea versus UAN. I know there is a more room to go based on the flexibility you have at Donaldsonville but, is this a decent representation of what the forward product mix looks like or is it even more skewed urea versus UAN.","Tony Will","I mean, it's really a question of \u2013 it's really a question of where prices are for the various products or trading. If we make more UAN, it uses both ammonia that would otherwise go into the nitric acid to AN piece in urea, if we dial back UAN it will make more urea we're getting urea and some excess ammonia out of it. So what Bert and Chris are doing is they're looking at the relative values of the various product prices where we sit in inventory with the demand profile looks like and then are trying to optimize what the production mix looks like.","And as we talked about in the comments in the script, we've got sort of pretty ample room to move probably between something like 300,000 to 700,000 tons of what we historically shipped to the EU into granular instead and make that just disappear. We've also got exports and more tank space and it doesn't necessarily have to show up as granular, it can also go out the door as either urea liquor or DEF, which \u2013 the demand for that continues to grow.","So when we built the projects, we built a lot of flexibility into the product mix side. And Bert and his team have done a great job of continuing to open up additional markets for us. That effort has been on its way \u2013 underway for like last four, five years. So I think, even though it's disruptive and it removes a little bit of our flexibility, it's something that we're in a position to manage going forward.","Adam Samuelson","And along those lines and the part, I mean your flexibility will impact certainly, but I mean historically UAN has commanded a premium on a nutrient basis to urea given kind of the value it adds to the farmers from a flexibility perspective and the added transportation logistics costs, is that a liquid product, does that change at all, as the market reorient itself and trade flows readjust.","Tony Will","I mean, I think, they're going to kind of bounce back and forth for a while, as the market sort of adjust the new trade flows and people figure out what sort of product mix \u2013 because other people have flexibility, particularly the Russians have some flexibility between NPKs, and AN and other options as well. So I think, what you'll see is those relationships kind of bounce around a little bit. Long term, I think, there needs to be a premium in UAN in order for people to justify putting the incremental capital into acid plants and the UAN plants because otherwise, if it doesn't command a premium, which you'll see us people stop putting maintenance into acid AN plants and just produce granular going forward.","So I think long-term eventually, you've got to see that return. But I don't know whether long term in this context means three months, six months or a year and a half, but we feel pretty comfortable that we'll get back there. And in the near term, we've got a lot of options in terms of how we deal with it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open for questions.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning everyone. A couple of questions. Last year during the Q1 release you did talk about, that you should expect that similar volumes in the first half of the year, as the year before you didn't have that commentary in this release. You did speak you can maybe it\u2019s not too late to catch up.","Could you give a little more color? Do you think you can get the same volume as last year \u2013 first half of the year, sorry?","Tony Will","Yes Joe, I'll turn it over to Bert to give you some specific commentary here in a minute. But through April, we're ahead of where we were on volume shipments last year. And so May or the first quarter was a little bit behind, but we've more than cut that up through April. So we're very comfortable with where we sit from a demand profile, Bert?","Bert Frost","Yes, just looking at it from an agronomic swing as you if you're planting corn or nitrogen consuming crops, which we still are estimating 92 million to 93 million acres to be planted them out of the short-cycle or long cycle. We still have a month left of field work in time to get the crop in which is plenty of time. We've proven that the market can move or the farm community can move in a matter of days to weeks with new equipment that's available.","And so if you plant you're going to apply nitrogen P&K will take a little more at risk depending on what was put down in the fall. But we have a lot of fall to make up that was lost in terms of ammonia that will be made up as well as if we do have to transition from ammonia to UAN or urea. We think that there is sufficient lease from CF and we would plan to train our inventory to pickup all that volume in Q2. And so I think it's just an understood that we would move that volume in the first half. And so that's probably why it wasn't stated.","Joel Jackson","That's great. And my second question on pricing. So we see where the Midwest Premium is trading now. We see that you realize for urea and UAN, some of your largest premiums to NOLA benchmarks for realized prices for years. So should we expect in the second quarter elevated realized pricing versus benchmark in NOLA. Thanks.","Tony Will","Well, as we went through the first part of the year, we positioned product in interior. We have the tanks for UAN, as well as the ammonia, we have the dry storage for urea the barge capacity to move it, the rail capacity to move it and the relationships in place to receive it if it's even not under our own control. So with that being said, yes, there is a premium to NOLA today and has been, and it has been expanding. I think it's also expanding for P&K. And that's the reflection of proper planning and distribution. And so I do think you'll see that carry through in the for Q2 realizations a nice spread.","Bert Frost","It's a nice conversation to have as suppose to us trying to defend the notion of an in-market premium being sustainable when people a few years ago, were talking about, that's getting wiped out in the fact of the matter is the evidence doesn't support that thesis. Like we're trading in a $100 in market premium right now because of supply disruptions and another issues and that's kind of what we've said all along. And we really enjoy the benefit of our network. As a result of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is now open for questions.","Ben Isaacson","Thank you and good morning. On the logistic challenges and you talk about your in region production and transportation distribution network, how are their advantages. Can you talk about that $100 premium and how much of that you benefit from and how much of that is the cost?","Tony Will","Well the costs haven't really changed. I think there were some disruptions in Q1, which I think have been communicated to the market relative to flooding that took place, that limited some rail service from the BN and UP as well as just poor service from the CP coming out of Canada. That has been corrected.","The barge logistics, there has been a lot of accumulation of barges in the northern end of for river opening. But I think part of it is just a dislocation. Some tons were sold short not supplied and so, a bit of a squeeze got put on. And also I just think that with the additional acres and the timing that moves to our advantage with our assets in place and our short moves from where our assets are in the heart of the Corn Belt and so that spread has expanded and we've followed that and taken advantage of it.","Tony Will","But I think also Ben on that point, the big issue is we've got a lot of rolling stock, we've got access to multiple rail lines , we've got our own barge network in our contract in place and traders and people that are bringing tons over who don't have access to that. And so what the in-market premium is really kind of reflecting is that there is instantaneous challenges of moving products from the Gulf other ports into the interior and we've got an ability to move diesel tons into the interior. We also have Port Neal and Verdigris and other end market plants that are already there.","And so from the coast it's probably or from diesel, it's $30 to $40 to move most of those tons kind of up into the Corn Belt. And so the spread between that price and what we're realizing today is it is sort of just the arbitrage that Bert was talking about earlier of either short squeezes or inability for traders to move tons because they don't have access to logistic.","Ben Isaacson","Great. And just quickly. My second question is, maybe just to expand on Joe's question you talked about how you are through April you're ahead of where you were a year ago. I think you mentioned for ammonia specifically, but what about urea, UAN and ammonium nitrate?","Chris Bohn","Yes, I mean shipments in aggregate are off at this point year-on-year. So we feel very comfortable both with kind of how demand is shaping up for this year what are, what our inventory position is what our book looks like and kind of again where prices are and where gas is, we're well ahead of what last year look like. So all of that shaping up to be a really solid first half for us.","Ben Isaacson","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland. Your line is now open for questions.","Michael Piken","Yes, hi, good morning. Wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of the outlook for Chinese exports. You said that you're looking for relatively flat levels of Chinese exports, year-on-year. Where do you see them on the cost curve and where do you see the Europeans right now?","Tony Will","Yes, relative to China they're producing due to some of the shutdowns and lower operating rates. We estimate the 53 million to 54 million metric tons per year run rate. They did export more in Q1. We believe that was a reflection of a couple of issues, one being the higher prices in Q4 that were realized and then product moved into position and exported in January and February as well as possibly some of the Iranian tons that have come in and have been re-exported.","And so for that reason we're fairly confident with where pricing is worldwide and where it's whether you're looking at the Arab Gulf, Asia price, NOLA price and the cost curve with their cost generally driven by coal.","Gas today is around $5 in China, the forward strip, especially for Q4 late Q3 and Q4 is back in the $7 to $9 range. And so that would curtail you would expect if we stay at this current pricing level. And so that's why we feel fairly comfortable estimating in the two million ton range for China to export.","Michael Piken","Okay, great. And then if you could talk a little bit about your expectation for the Iranian urea in terms of how much product is theoretically available at this point. If you think India, who has been aggressive in tenders, or is it China, or where could the product theoretically go and what's your expectation?","Tony Will","I mean, our expectation is that all of that production finds its way out in the public marketplace. There is enough people and the world demands that product and there's enough people kind of willing to chase the dollars that we're just planning on all of that production coming out. So we don't believe all of a sudden, there's going to be some huge disruption to the supply side. That said, if the U.S. actually does get on sanctions and makes it more difficult bidders there's possible upside there for us, but we're certainly not planning on per year there.","Chris Bohn","No, I agree, I think the surprise was the tonnage has gone to Brazil that was partnered for soybeans or corn that was a new development. I think you're seeing further restrictions and especially the sanctions that were announced recently that tighter full on sanctions royal which will transition to urea. We believe it does make it difficult for those extraneous markets and then I think there is an issue to the sustainability of their production with an inability to work with the providers of services and products and materials at longer-term if this stays would make that probably a question mark on production.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open for questions.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. So a big seed company surprised us recently by saying that it sees corn acres moving back to soy or maybe moving back to soy. So I'm curious what your market intelligence says about the extent of that risk.","Bert Frost","At this point, I think it's too early to tell, you can if you look at the, really it's an economic decision on the corn to being spread and that's still attractive to corn and if I were to look at it and being able to yield it on trend with corn and\/or soybeans, looking at what the difficulties could be out there with soybeans and the production that's expected to come out of South America and already has as well as the consumption in China with the possible impact of the African swine fever that \u2013 what that could be or communicated demand. So I think of safer choice would be to stay with corn, I don't think we have gone through wet years, we've gone through dry years and as Tony articulated and as Dennis and I did also that there is still plenty of time to plant and we believe that people will make an economic choice.","Dennis Kelleher","I mean, the other thing I'd add Bert if I can, Mark is if you look at stocks to use soy is really high and corn is actually kind of down to 2012 or below levels. And so as we just look at our own we don't have Intel that the seed guys do. But as we look at our order book and where product prices are for nitrogen, as we look at with the in-market premium is and the urgent demand for our products and just kind of what the overall shipment pattern has been despite it being a pretty tough first quarter. We are very comfortable with Canada, what the acreage numbers look like and what we see developing for the first half of the year.","Mark Connelly","It makes a lot of sense to me. I don't know how easy it is to separate the sales, but how are you thinking about transportation costs this year versus last and first half versus second half, we obviously got hit a lot with transportation last year, but now we got all this logistics noise. So, just curious if you can figure out what's happening and whether we're going to see a benefit in the second half.","Tony Will","I would say it's probably roughly flat, maybe up or down just up a little bit is what I'm getting the math around the table. But I think it's, whatever small amount gets moved there if you think about it on a per MMBTU kind of cost in terms of the gas content of the product, we're going to see that a favorable impact in terms of the price that we're buying gas relative to the distribution costs. So net-net, on a COGS basis in terms of moving those tons in the market, they ought to be at a lower aggregate cost. I think we're also seeing a movement in the form of transportation. We're seeing a little less barge availability just given what's going on in terms of the river and as Bert talked about Iselux still in the Northern part, inability to access Minneapolis and so forth. So we're seeing a bit more rail and probably a bit more truck less parts. So that's a little bit higher mode. Cost, but I think it's not going to be one of those things that jumps off the page is all the sudden Wow I'm shocked that this numbers is what it is.","Bert Frost","I guess Mark, the only other thing I'd add is, as I said in my prepared remarks, we think of our business is a six month business at least, more like a year and I've been in this company now for eight years and I've never seen a so called typical first quarter, typical second quarter and what we saw and where we saw it, differs every year and that changes the mix on transportation.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open for questions.","Graeme Welds","Hi, good morning everyone. This is Graeme Welds on for Chris. Piggybacking on an earlier question around the global cost curve, you mentioned the fact that you expect gas prices in China increases as we go through the years kind of curious, you had a flat a couple quarters back that kind of spoke to the average range that you saw for NOLA pricing kind of based on the global cost curve. I'm curious, if there any updates on that kind of roughly where those ranges would kind of shake out based on what you're seeing now.","Tony Will","Yes, I mean, I would give you just a quick jest and I'll toss it over to Dennis. But we publish kind of an estimated cost curve for the year, only about once a year and it\u2019s one of the things that change is very dynamically. I mean obviously the day that it's published, which tends to be October, it's already out of date because the stuff moves very quickly. Obviously, because of a fair bit of a lot of LNG gas prices in Europe for instance are lower than the normal sort of oil index basis would have traditionally had then pegged that, but if you look at the forward curve for NBP and TTF, it's got to going back to $7 plus by the fourth quarter.","So we think in the near term there's a little bit of dislocation, but honestly, if you look at where the price curve was that we published, last October it projected price range of like $260 to $300 and we traded within that range and we're still within that range today. So even though it's kind of a little bit older, and some of those buyers have moved. It's not wildy inaccurate that\u2019s still where urea is trading today.","Dennis Kelleher","I just want to just expand a little bit on Tony's point. If you look at Western Europe and Eastern Europe, you get gas or oil linked contracts. If you look at those forward curves into the next two years or so, what you see is that the gas price restores to it's sort of, if you will, relationship to oil around 60% to 65% price on an energy equivalent basis. So although we see it as sort of anomalous period right now with \u2013 in LNG glut because of the warm winter in Asia affecting Europe, both Eastern and Western, their market certainly expects the historical relationship between oil and gas to be restored in the relatively near-term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Luke Washer","Hi guys, this is actually Luke Washer on for Steve. I wanted to touch on the logistics challenges in the upper Midwest. I appreciate the detail there. But do you see \u2013 and I know you talked about your in region production, but do you have any urea in barges that are \u2013 can't get to the upper Mississippi, you talked about challenges in Minnesota because of these lot closures and flooding, and is there any risk that some of your product was could be challenged in getting to the retail channel, a little bit too late.","Bert Frost","No, I think for how we manage our relationships with our customers who are the retailers and the wholesalers, we're actively selling that product on an FOB basis NOLA and if we send barges up the river selling them along the way. And then we have barges, the only place that we received CF material is in Minneapolis, which Tony mentioned, we've been supplying by rail. We do have barges set to go up to Minneapolis, but we also supply Cincinnati, which is a rented facility by barge that has not been constrained.","And so when you look across our network in Medicine Hat, where we ship out by rail and truck Port Neal. Also, as I mentioned, we shipped one day of 10,000 tons by truck that's not constrained at all. So we leverage each of those points which the each of the modes possible in order to operate them efficiently, safely and with the economic receiver opportunity available to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open for questions.","Andrew Wong","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask about capital allocation plans, so beyond your current repurchase program and the debt payments that you have planned, what thoughts do you have on just growing the business either organically through debottlenecks expansions or maybe just looking externally and adding to your business. Thanks.","Tony Will","Yeah, I mean we obviously look at all kinds of things whether it's organic or inorganic and I don't see us do a big sort of bold brownfield or greenfield kind of expansion, like we did back in 2012 because assets trade are trading below replacement cost. So there's no reason to go out and do that kind of thing. What you have seen that the industry undertaking a fair bit of upgrade kind of projects, so Coke and nutrient and the coal gas and others have taken on urea projects and other things that have been converting more ammonia into urea and those are \u2013 it doesn't change the nutrient balance from an SMB standpoint, but it improves economics for those people to do it largely because there is a very expensive transportation logistics costs around ammonia.","And then when you have, weather vagaries and in the fall and in the spring, sometimes you're not able to move as much ammonia as you want in the ag space. And so it's just more predictable and reliable, if you've got upgraded products. So we certainly would think about that debottleneck or do on some upgrades. I don't know that we need a lot more ammonia right now, just because we've got a lot of ammonia as it is, but I could envision us thinking about doing debottlenecks on some of the upgrades and converting more ammonia into upgraded product.","And we're constantly looking at logistics players and other things to make our existing network more efficient, whether it's exporting out of D\u2019Ville or moving product into the interior, giving us different access to multiple modes of transportation, so we can \u2013 our different lanes and so forth. That's kind of what we're thinking about. And on the inorganic side, it's always a question of, is it cash flow accretive or are there other alternatives and if there's something that we can find that fits within our capability set where we can leverage our skills and create some value that's cash flow accretive, we think about it, but in the absence of that we're very comfortable continuing to drive and improve our existing network.","Andrew Wong","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson for Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Don Carson","Thank you. Tony a question on offshore ammonia, we've seen the Tampa price just hit $237 for May which is a 20 month low. So what's going on in offshore ammonia? Is this pressure for just lower cost product out of, say Iran or the lower global cost curve? And what business imply for your export opportunities in ammonia at these kind of price levels?","Bert Frost","When you look at \u2013 what has been taking place in ammonia globally. There has been additional supply that has come on the Russian plant that came on recently the full world scale, there are others in terms of new additions. But with \u2013 we have also seen a weakness in phosphate and so a little bit less industrial demand not only in North Africa but in \u2013 with Mosaic shutdown of Faustina \u2013 not Faustina, excuse me, of the Florida asset. And so with less available demand at this point and additional supply the pricing had \u2013 I think come down to a level that where it has, and that's also reflective of some of the gas movements that we've seen globally. We do expect that to improve have obviously as gas prices modulator move back to what Dennis talked about on a global comparison to its \u2013 to the energy equivalent of oil, as well as some of the other high-cost plants coming off an increased demand as phosphates and industrial demand improved. We see that improving.","Tony Will","But obviously Don, the current prevailing prices, ammonia exports in the industrial space are kind of our last resort. So that goes into the math as we think about mixed decisions on UAN versus urea and whether we've got options domestically to take more of that product or we\u2019re forced to export some of it and ammonia exports right now don't look good for anybody regards urea.","Don Carson","And then as a follow-up, there is some talk north of the border of extending the carbon tax to industrial uses of natural gas. If that happens what does that do for the competitiveness of Alberta production and could that raise the price floor in the Midwest, given all the urea and ammonia that\u2019s coming down from Western Canada to the Corn Belt.","Tony Will","Yes, I mean carbon is one of those things, and we spent a fair bit of time talking to regulators on both sides of the border about this which is as long as any regime that's put in place is applied to imports as well as local production then it just raises the bar for everybody and ultimately it's passed on to the consumer. And the problem is, if you just apply it for domestic production and don't apply it to imports, then what you're doing is shifting production and jobs offshore and you're going to end up effectively closing domestic manufacturer and that's just poor economic policy because it's carbon leakage.","We operate some of the most efficient plants in Canada. There's already a tax regime on carbon in Alberta and we're working with the regulators up there. It's obviously changing dynamic given the new parties in power in the provinces and that's a shifting dynamic. But I don't anticipate that it's going to have a dramatic effect one way or another on pricing in the U.S. or in Canada or in terms of our financial results.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.","Dan Jester","Yes, hi guys. It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So with all the talk on the call today about the in-market premium and logistics challenges. I'm wondering if you could just comment, why you chose to sell your Pine Bend facility in-market-logistics facility? And just maybe to longer-term, is there an opportunity for a bit of investment in sort of the upper Midwest to capture a few extra incremental tonnes whether it's storage or logistics more broadly. Thanks.","Tony Will","Yes. I mean we view Pine Bend the same we do, for instance, our phosphate business back in the day and so forth, which is we divest economic owner for it or somebody else. Are we getting maximum value. What's the return on capital employed as we think about what is \u2013 what the market values worth and can we solve that at different direction? That asset was the legacy from the period of time where we were a co-op and we were sourcing all kinds of products for our member owners and holding it there and moving it around and it became sort of incrementally less valuable to us when we sold our phosphate business because we used to move a lot of phosphate there and also became incrementally less important when we built the urea plant at Port Neal because that gave us access to that same region on a truck reach basis and the fact of the matter is we were just under utilized in that space, there's over 200,000 tons of space there, and we were using, about 20 of it.","And so it didn't make sense for us to continue to own it. The agreement that we reached with Mosaic it gives us access to be able to continue to put tons through that facility, and they are much better economic owner of that asset, it\u2019s good for them, it's good for us and so like any other decision we make this is strictly on who is the right owner.","Bert Frost","Yes. And looking at it, we were already working with Mosaic and a few others providing services and we just didn't see ourselves as a service provider in that space. As Tony said, they were the best economic owner and kind of reverse flow that we became a service-taker and moving our products on an as needed basis. So we have an agreement to move our urea up to Pine Bend for utilizing the space that we need and then Mosaic has the rest for P&K. And we have 130 maybe a little more 1,000 tons of space of Port Neal, as well as space in Medicine Hat. We have been out not acquiring, but at leasing and opening up new space for our UAN throughout the Midwest, so that has been accretive to us also.","Dan Jester","Great, thank you. And then just a quick one for Dennis about the free cash flow conversion from EBITDA. You've got this nice chart in your slide deck. I'm just wondering over the cycle is that two-thirds of EBITDA in the free cash flow a reasonable benchmark or is there been onetime factors over the past year or two which has boosted that. Thanks.","Dennis Kelleher","The question is where do you sit with sort of your operating cash flow and sort of EBITDA. If you think about our CapEx, what we said is we intend to be sort of around $4 million [ph] to $400 million a year that's kind of flattish. So that piece of the equation, we're showing doesn't change. Obviously as the EBITDA and cash flow of our company's CF changes, it changes as well for a non-controlling interest distribution, which is to CHS and obviously they own a piece of our biggest subsidiary, CF, and so that's going to move up and down.","So what I'd say is, a lot of the pieces are going to move up and down with EBITDA in that equation except for CapEx, so that fixed portion will have somewhat muting effect on that.","Dan Jester","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Jeremy on for Vincent. Thanks for taking my questions. So I wanted to start on the Chinese export, I just wanted to circle back on that. We've seen some data that suggest that China may even be considering importing urea in the near-term. Does the kind of expectation for flat urea exports depend on that dynamic?","Bert Frost","No, I think that has been a reflection of kind of where market pricing was in Q1, you saw the Qataris move some prilled urea into China into the northern ports. I think as well as the Iranian tonnage that has been moved up into the same area and where the preponderance of production is in the south. And so I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation over time that as these inefficient plants go offline or cost to transport become more market-based that you would see additional imports or incremental imports into China during that Q1 as they're ramping up into their peak consumptions season. I think that's a positive for the market.","Tony Will","I also think it demonstrates a real commitment on the part of the Central Government around their environmental policy, which is urea production, particularly in China, which tends to be largely coal-based that carries a very large environmental footprint, whether it's scarce water usage particular matter emissions and so forth. And I think with the question of the rightfully asking, is this something we need to be doing given the toll it\u2019s taken on the environment, and I think the answer is no there is plenty of freely traded urea out there, they're importing soy, they\u2019re importing corn, they\u2019re importing other things why go out of their way to be self sufficient to our core access and urea production when it carries a big hole. And I think you're seeing a recognition that doesn't really make a lot of sense.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Neivert from Cowen. Your line is now open for questions.","Charles Neivert","Good morning, guys. Just one question, given the fact that things seem to be delayed and then maybe there is a chance that some of the N that would typically go down pre-plant, it\u2019s going to go \u2013 isn't going to get down? Does it look like there is going to be a longer-than-normal side-dress season? Or larger than amount of normal product going in on side-dress and therefore maybe getting pricing and volume that extends out maybe even into early 3Q this year, as opposed to normally sort of ending \u2013 during the late part of 2Q?","Tony Will","Yes. For sure. I mean, I think you're spot on, just because it's not in the pre-plant does not mean that you lose that you get the post-plant side-dress, top-dress, the application technology that's available as well as, this is why we're aligned with the retail network. And why the retail network adds value and why we want to have these relationships with our customers like CHS and grow market nutrient and people like that, Helena, that are active in the market dealing with these issues. They can run 24\/7 and will and will move from end-to-end to make sure that that product gets supplied and the crops are fed. So I can see us going well into \u2013 not well into, but into July for sure. And we normally do with the pivot season in Nebraska in the irrigated acres does go into July. I would bet more of that \u2013 more tons move that direction because of this later application.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open for questions.","John Roberts","Yes, thank you. So bit of a tangential question, does IMO 2020 reflects some of the global trade in fertilizers late this year? It's lot of ocean-going product obviously and they've got a sort of time. I guess the switchover in their fuels that\u2019s there. So maybe some shipments occur earlier in the year, so they're not right at the year-end deadline when the shipping companies have to deal with that issue?","Tony Will","Go ahead, Bert.","Bert Frost","Well we've experienced similar issues with positive train control and the changes that are required legislatively or by government bodies and this is something that the industry has been watching. I'm not sure if there will be delays or extensions allowed. But it is a big change going from the bunkering system that we have today and how either vessels are retrofitted or just jumped and new vessels are built to accommodate these issues. I think that we \u2013 for us there is more to come.","John Roberts","Okay. You're not hearing anything at this point about maybe doing shipments earlier in the year just to avoid a year end kind of logistical challenge possibly.","Tony Will","No, I mean I think the issue though is the industry runs 24\/7\/365, and so it's hard to kind of quote unquote pre-ship stuff because it's not that you're running on a shift basis and building a bunch of inventory disgorging it. You got to ship it as you produce it. And so, there really isn't that kind of opportunity to do that in any meaningful way.","John Roberts","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Martin Jarosick for closing remarks.","Martin Jarosick","Thanks everyone, and we look forward to speaking with you in the next few weeks and then we'll see many of you at several conferences over the next month.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

We will provide updates on the OCI transaction when appropriate through filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, company press release, and\/or other appropriate communications.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Last night we posted CF Industries 2016 first quarter results, in which we generated EBITDA of $207 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $300 million after taking into account net foreign currency losses, mark-to-market hedges losses, transaction cost related to CHS and OCI, and expenses related to the capacity expansion projects.","The difficult market conditions in North America from late last year persisted into the early part of this year. However, as demand developed with the onset of spring, prices quickly moved up into the range we believe represents sustainable prices for the industry. Although industry publications reported January and February Urea pricing and NOLA well below $200, our realized price for the quarter was $256 a ton.","Our reported gross margin was $217 million or 22% of approximately $1 billion of net sales. What I want to focus on is the strength in the underlying fundamentals of our business. To really understand those fundamentals, it is necessary to strip away the noise and short-term timing issues and look at just the core business. Excluding the impact of our natural gas hedges, consolidated gross margin would have been $294 million or around 30%. The unrealized mark-to-market derivative loss was $21 million, and the realized natural gas derivative loss was $56 million for a total impact of $77 million associated with natural gas hedges. Over time, as the hedge position roles off, that noise will disappear and the core business will shine through.","As we talked about on our last call, and as shown on slide 12 of our materials, even at our urea price of $200 per ton, a typical U.S. Gulf producer generates roughly 50% cash margins on each incremental ton. And it is into this attractive environment, that we are bringing on our new capacity additions. Our new urea plant at Donaldsonville was placed into service last November and is reliably operating 10% to 15% above nameplate capacity. Our new Donaldsonville nitric acid and UAN plants were placed into service in March and are reliably operating 15% to 20% above nameplate capacity and we haven't even pushed them to the limit yet.","We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and are in the process of pre-commissioning and commissioning activities, so the burn rate spend there has round back considerably. And we expect to be fully mechanically completed Port Neal by the end of the second quarter, meaning our spending on the new projects will largely be wrapped up in the next two months.","Finally, during the first quarter, our strategic venture with CHS commenced. We received $2.8 billion in cash and began selling urea and UAN to them at market prices. On a Global basis, capacity additions along with lower feedstock cost and cheaper ocean freight have led to a widening and flattening of the Global cost curve over the last year. However, due to sustained annual growth in nitrogen demand, even with all of the additional capacity, during periods with more robust demand, higher cost tons must be bid into the market.","We believe the Chinese anthracite coal-based facilities will continue to be the marginal cost producers for the foreseeable future setting the global cost for. In fact, Bert and I recently spent a week in China and met with about 10 different industry participants at their plants, the ports and their offices to gain additional insights into the evolving dynamics in China. Over the course of several days and over 1,000 miles traveled, we came away with a few key themes. One, there are broad-based expectations that the nitrogen fertilizer industry will continue to rationalize closing high cost inefficient plants.","It is estimated that between 50% and 60% of the installed industry capacity in China is still anthracite based coal-production and these facilities, along with certain gas fed plants are the ones most at risk. Subsidies are being dramatically reduced or eliminated altogether including rail, electricity, and feedstock. One producer we spoke with suggested that roughly $25 per ton to $30 per ton cost increase for them. And there's a heightened awareness and significant pressure being applied both at the central and local government levels regarding the significant environmental impact caused by these facilities. All of these points suggest that in fact, almost every group we met with expects that significant capacity will be removed from China over the next several years.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Bert and Dennis to go through the details of the quarter, and I'll wrap up with a few final thoughts. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Thanks, Tony. The first quarter was definitely a tale of two very different time periods. Entering the quarter, pricing and demand were low and the industry outlook wasn't very positive. As Tony mentioned, in North America urea traded at less than $200 per ton in the U.S. Gulf at the beginning of the quarter, which we considered unsustainable. As such, we decided to position the company for an improved forward market. As spring weather broke early in many parts of the country, we began selling into the market as prices quickly rebounded. Prices began to rise in mid-February and continue rising through March with urea at the Gulf topping out at $270 a ton and prices in the corn belt trading above $300 per ton.","In addition to the earlier arrival of spring weather, low prices at the beginning of the quarter did not attract a high level of imports of urea and UAN to North America, which also aided the rebound and led to nitrogen Q1 supply being short in the corn belt. Shipment and application activities were strong in March for ammonia, urea and UAN, but especially for ammonia. Warm dry weather came early and farmers in the Southern Plains and Midwest were prepared and ammonia sales in those regions marked one of our best starts to a spring season.","To put this into perspective, the previous record shipment from March out of our Blair Nebraska terminal was 38,000 tons. In March, we surpassed 62,000 tons. That means that the terminal had to on average, load four trucks an hour 24 hours a day, every day of the month. Our consolidated sales volume for the quarter was very strong, up approximately 39% year-over-year, aided by the addition of CF Fertilizers, UK, and our capacity expansions. We also logged a record quarter for the production of urea at approximately 819,000 tons.","Looking to the global markets, production and feedstock costs continue to have a big impact in the first quarter of 2016, along with currency devaluations. However, global costs appeared to have hit floor levels in the first quarter of 2016. Though coal supply is long, coal prices found a bottom in December and have remained stable since. Similarly, the global oil situation is still long supply, but prices have begun to recover from the lows in January.","Ocean freight rates have declined substantially due to oversupply of both vessels and lower fuel prices, but it appears that after two years of declines, these costs have hit a floor as well. Export activity from China was down almost 38% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2016. As global prices continued to fall, high-cost Chinese anthracite coal-based producers began to curtail production and limited tons shipped to the ports for export.","In addition, Chinese fertilizer industry publications recently stated that several urea producers in China were permanently shut down in 2015, which was the first time ever that reductions have exceeded new production coming online. Additionally, the Chinese Nitrogen Fertilizer Association's 2016 through 2020 Development Plan calls for more of the smaller, old plants to be phased out by the end of the decade, reducing the country's ammonia capacity by an estimated 10 million metric tons per year and urea capacity by 13 million metric tons per year. All of these data points lead us to believe that our view of the global cost curve is reasonably accurate.","Moving on to North American natural gas. The market began the first quarter with unexpectedly cold January that changed the gas market's focus from how low prices could potentially fall to how quickly prices could climb. Henry Hub Gas Daily was trading at $1.54 on December 28, 2015 and reached prices as high as $2.53 only 15 days later on January 12. This price rally was short-lived, as prices declined through the latter half of January and into the beginning of March. The declining price was due to a collapse of gas-weighted heating degree days that far exceeded even the mildest projections, underperforming industrial demand and slower-than-anticipated LNG exports.","The combination of these factors led to an end of March storage balance just under 2.5 Tcf, 54% higher than the five-year average and more than 1 Tcf higher than last year. We believe this abundant resource will continue to provide CF with a competitive advantage over other global producers for the foreseeable future.","The nitrogen outlook for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017 remains positive. But with new capacity coming online globally over the next 12 months, we expect nitrogen pricing to remain under pressure. We expect urea demand at the U.S. Gulf to continue to be relatively firm through the spring application season.","On the agricultural front, economics continue to support planting corn over soybeans and our planted corn forecast is 92 million acres, with further upside possible given a favorable USDA survey for spring planting intentions. Corn use growth is forecasted at 2% for the fertilizer year 2016 and 2017, as demand is expected to rebound near 2014 levels. And December corn is currently trading near $3.90 per bushel, all positive signs for the farmer and for our business.","Now let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Bert. In the first quarter of 2016, we generated $217 million (sic) [$207 million] in EBITDA and earnings per diluted share of $0.11. Included in these results were on a pre-tax basis approximately $42 million of net foreign currency losses, $21 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on our natural gas derivatives, $16 million in expansion cost for our Donaldsonville and Port Neal facilities and $14 million in transaction costs related to the OCI transaction and the CHS strategic venture.","When taking these items into account, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $300 million and our adjusted net earnings per diluted share was $0.40. Included in these results is a realized loss of $56 million or $0.79 per MMBtu on our natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2016. This compares to a realized loss of $32 million or $0.52 per MMBtu on natural gas hedges for the first quarter of 2015. During the first quarter of 2016, the company did not enter into any additional natural gas hedges.","Additionally, in the first quarter of 2016, the company placed into service the new UAN plant at Donaldsonville. We expect to place into service the new ammonia plant at Donaldsonville and the new ammonia and urea plants at Port Neal later this year. As we mentioned on our last call, most of these assets will qualify for the 50% bonus depreciation for fiscal year 2016 as a result of the passage of the PATH Act by Congress last year. As a result of these additional assets being placed into service, the company expects to have significantly reduced cash tax payments for the year.","I want to take a brief moment to describe the mechanics of the CHS strategic venture. On February 1, 2016, we received $2.8 billion in our cash account related to this investment. Each quarter we recognize a non-controlling interest amount related to this investment, which, for the first quarter, was $17 million. However, the cash distribution payable semiannually to CHS may be different from the amount recorded as non-controlling interest in any given period based on the terms of the agreement, which, in effect, provides producer economics to CHS. The estimate of this distribution pertaining to the first quarter is approximately $30 million.","Moving on, for 2016, the company expects to have total capital expenditures in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion, of which $1.3 million to $1.4 billion will be used for the capacity expansion projects and the other $500 million to $600 million for sustaining improvement and other projects.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Dennis. I want to summarize why we continue to be so excited and optimistic about our business. The fundamentals of our business remain strong. There is a growing demand for our product and we benefit from low cost North American gas. Our consolidated gross margin was 30% ex the impact of gas hedges and our cash margins for incremental production are 50% or better. Our plants are running well. We had record production for urea in the first quarter and one of the top three quarters for ammonia production as well. We fully expect to hit an all-time record for UAN production here in Q2 with the new diesel plant online.","The expansion projects are almost done. We are mechanically complete on the Donaldsonville ammonia plant and within two months of being mechanically complete at Port Neal, so the spending is quickly coming to an end. When those plants are online, they will increase our productive capacity by more than 25% and along with it our corresponding cash flow generation as well. Our balance sheet, credit metrics and liquidity are all strong. We have a solid investment-grade rating. We have a $2 billion undrawn revolver and we have $2.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet at the quarter-end.","Finally, bonus depreciation will provide a significant cash flow benefit to this year and next. So although the pricing environment is weaker than we'd like, nonetheless, we are extremely excited about the bright future ahead and what the next few months hold for us.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. First question, I appreciate your remarks to not want to talk about the OCI transaction. Can you just talk about why you can't comment on the OCI transaction today? I guess there's a new S4 (18:03) coming out after OCI reported, maybe you renegotiating some of the terms just maybe high level. Why you can't talk about that?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Hi, Joel. Look, we have tried to make it a hallmark to be as transparent and communicative as possible, and we're just not in a position where we're going to be talking about OCI today.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Okay. Second question is, don't you have the lowest customer advances for Q1 you had since a public company, can you maybe talk about if you had a lot volumes stronger in Q1 than Q2, would you expect a little bit of softness in Q2 because you have strong Q1, maybe more in the urea side?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So, Joel. This is Bert. Good morning. Looking at Q1 and the start of Q1, the low level of customer advances was a direct reflection of our view of the market that at that time, going out of Q4 and into Q1 that prices that were, at that point, available to us in the North American market just were not attractive. And we were bid at probably levels even below that.","And we decided at that point it was more appropriate for us to utilize our storage capabilities and our terminal system and that as well as our plant space and prepare for a market that we believe would come later in Q1, which was then materialized or started to materialize in February as prices started to improve going into spring.","So you've seen us over the years take different tactics into the market, sometimes we have sold forward in previous years, we don't do as much of that anymore and we're playing in a Global market where we look at opportunities both inside North America and outside different markets.","We have relationships around the world and we intend to utilize those capabilities as well as flexible production options because that's how we built these plants, the new plants that are coming online to be tremendously flexible for us in terms of going full UAN, full urea, or even full ammonia as we have during this Q1 period to satisfy the high ammonia demand we had.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thank you. This is Graham Wells (20:22) on for Chris. First question, I was just wondering if you could help us to think about what the effect of your mark-to-market hedges will be once nat-gas starts kind of rebounding off of its lows. Just any help on how the realized and unrealized gains or losses will flow through the P&L from that? And then second question, is just on your realized ammonia prices in 1Q. They are a bit lower than we were expecting and we were just wondering if you could help us parse out kind of where those tons were going and why that kind of came in at slightly lower level than we were expecting? Thanks","Dennis P. Kelleher - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. This is Dennis. Why don't I start with the natural gas hedge and how to sort of think about that. Without getting into specific numbers, I think it's really easy to \u2013 if you think about the disclosures what we made in the past. We've disclosed how many MMBTu's we have hedged going forward. And there was a graph, I think, that we've put out in \u2013 as part of the 4Q earnings release, that basically mapped out exactly what those hedges are going through time and where their prized.","So as you think about the forward curve through that period as that forward curve rises \u2013 if in fact it rises, it may fall as well, we don't know. So as we think about where that forward curve is when we valued it at quarter's end here at March 31, versus where it may move to through time in the quarter, that will have a change on sort of the mark-to-market, because the mark-to-market stuff that you're seeing is in relation to hedges that have not been realized and did not closed out.","So as we go through time, two things are happening, more of those things are being realized although they're technically falling off the forward map, and at the same time, the curve is rising and falling versus the price on those curves; you sort of add up the MMBtu's and then the difference between where, any given point is on the curve, and where we are in the hedge curve, which we've disclosed, you can kind of come at it that way mathematically.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","On the second question \u2013 this is Bert regarding the ammonia pricing and what was expected or what was possibly put out there by different groups. You have to understand that Q1 is not necessarily an ammonia application period, although as we stated in our prepared remarks, we had record pull out of our Blair terminal and that was a phenomenon in Q1 that was predominately in that Nebraska region. However, just as prices were very low in January for urea they were also very low for ammonia. We had not only on the import market, which is Tampa driven, which is at $310 a metric ton or about $280 a short ton. That number got pulled into the United States in several regions and prices were low. And we took the same tactic that we did with urea, we decided not to sell into that market.","The industrial percentage of our business in Q1 is higher and that most industrial contracts are gas-based. During that period you had $2 gas. And again Tampa based, so I already gave you the Tampa number. We also had an export vessel, 25,000 tons that we exported at Tampa equivalents were a little bit below that. All that to say that the weight of the Q1 number was pushed more towards the industrial side of our business. You'll see that revert back to more of a traditional strip for Q2 as that's more of an Ag-based quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hey. Thanks guys, thanks for taking my question. Bert, you spoke about expected production phase-out in China over the coming years, I was just wondering if you could talk about how much of that relates to kind of economics and how much to environmental? And from your trip, are there environmental pressures in China that could result in faster phase-out of capacity there?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Yeah. So Tony and I did, as Tony said in his remarks, spent a week, a little over 10 days in Asia, we went to some other places. And the consistent message coming out of China for us was one of their going through a change. And as we've said in the past, each year seems to be a different economic year coming out of China. Incentives are different, subsidies are different, taxes are different production levels are different. And today they're really struggling trying to find their way and trying different steps in order to maintain profitability.","Last year that step was record exports. We just don't see that going forward. It's unsustainable. And what they were doing last year was just sending product to the ports. Yantai where we revisited last year, there was probably 2 million tons, 2.5 million tons sitting in bags at the port ready for export unsold. What we're seeing as a transition to more market-based decisions is we've heard from several traders and participants, that until they sell those tons, they're not going to move them to the port. A great economic decision, which we think will prevent some of the low prices that were coming in last year.","So economics are driving a lot of decisions on how they look at efficiencies, how they look at investments, how they're looking at shipments and this year, first quarter and into the second quarter the domestic market was much more profitable than the export market. And you saw a lot of producers pull away from the export market. So I think it's maturing and their understanding what their options are. In 2011, 2012 and 2013 when urea was over $400, everybody made money. It was an easy decision to participate and produce. That's no longer going to be the case for several of the high cost producers, those anthracite coal producers. And we think rationalization will continue.","On the environmental front, all I can tell you is, it's dirty. And we drove through several places and several cities and both, Tony and I were amazed. You see the pictures in the newspapers; it's different in real life. And you almost could cut through it and you could see maybe a half a mile away. You drive by rivers; you drive by piles of garbage, that can't continue. Just as we had rivers burn in the 1960s and 1970s in Wisconsin and Lake Erie, we had to make the same kind of changes that they're going to have to make. They're going to have to change their effluent streams, they're going to have to capture some of these gas streams, and that will all come in with investment and environmental awareness will take place.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","What we heard specifically on the environmental side is the central government has put in place certain parameters and thresholds and then local governments are able to put tighter ones in place that can't put more lax ones. And so it really depends upon the region that you're in, but there are certainly some areas for which significant capital is going to be required in order to keep running those plants and based on the current economic outlook, we just don't see that capital being spent and we heard that loud and clear.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","That's helpful. Thanks. And just one more from me. As you look to export more out of D'ville and that will be on time, (27:30) but do you have plans to access the Brazilian nitrogen market? And how do you expect to do that? Is there a large capital need there or partnership to gain access to that market?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, so I'm going to let Bert answer the question. But let me just talk philosophically about it for a second, which is, we have always tried to stick with our knitting in terms of things that we do really well and then find partners to participate in the areas of the channel where they do things well. We are not interested in taking on receivable risk from farmers. We're not interested in taking on currency risk.","So when we participate in these markets, it tends not to be with owned assets on the ground in those locations where we're exposing ourselves to those kinds of risks. It tends to be with partnering with other people and selling it either on a deliberate basis into their tanks or on an FOB basis. But Bert why don't you talk specifically about it?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So we're active in Brazil today. We were when Keytrade was with us and we'll continue to be probably more involved as we do have the volume of exports that are available to us but it will have to be netback driven. Brazil has tended to be a very low-price market in relation to the rest of the world's options. But we know those people down there, I spent eight years in Brazil. I'll be down there next month with a group and intend to connect with some of the industry participants.","As Tony said, we do not desire to be asset owners in that market and do not believe we need to be. We think that the channel is well served. There are good partners down there. We desire to monetize our position immediately and not take the risks that Tony mentioned. I do think there are changes to Petrobras' asset base that are coming. I think they're on the high end of the cost curve and I don't think where their assets are located and what they're doing today make a lot of sense. So you have a 5-million ton urea market that's available. A lot of the international producers are participating. We're developing UAN. We've shipped several cargoes down there and we think that will grow. I think it has a very good growth pattern, so you'll see us down there more and more.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just a question on Chinese imports to the U.S. And I recognize the 2015 data is a little bit skewed by the size of the exports from China in general. But I'm just curious, of the 12 months of the year, in the United States, how many of those months do you think we still need to actually physically have Chinese product come in? And how has that changed over the last couple of years? And do you think the risk is that in those months we really just don't need to cover that cost at all in the U.S. and, therefore, any Middle Eastern company can come in and sell at that price?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Traditionally, Chinese product has been perceived as lower quality. They're granular products because how they move it to the port, how it's loaded onto vessels and the time sometimes it sits in the port, it degrades. And then it arrives because of a long voyage into the United States and a lot of the comments we get back from our customers is they'd prefer not to buy it.","So what you see today is there are two price levels in NOLA, for Chinese and non-Chinese. But we are an import market. And an import market will draw tons from everywhere: Middle East, Russia, Asia. And today Chinese product trades at a discount and I think as long as it trades at a differential low enough, people will buy it.","That being said, Chinese product participation in the North American market looks to be declining. You have a few that bring it in and blend it. And so what we see going forward I think, the broad story we're communicating today is that a part of these changes is probably Chinese product will remain more and more in Asia, maybe go into South America little bit, but you'll see declining exports, which mean fewer imports into North America most likely.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And so does that mean \u2013 I guess what I'm trying to ask is there are now going to be a more localized cost curve based on where product is distributed to rather than the global cost curve?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Vincent, I think even at the high watermark, there wasn't more than about 1.5 million tons from China that ever found its way to the U.S. Generally speaking, it's Arab Gulf tons and Canadian tons that come into the U.S. marketplace. But from a North American perspective, it's mostly Arab Gulf. And the Chinese stuff is more around the fringe.","So we see most of those tons being backed out. But North America's going to \u2013 even after our projects come online and the other ones that are in construction today, North America will still import roughly 30% of its total nitrogen requirements. And so we've heard this noise about, oh, it's going to become a balanced market. But the people that say that include Trinidad tons as part of the North American balance. And the last time I looked on a map, Trinidad wasn't part of North America, at least the way my geography teachers taught it.","So this notion somehow that the end market premium is going away, I'd say show me where the production is that's going to make that happen. Someone still has to bid those tons into the marketplace in order for there to be enough nitrogen to hit the ground in the Corn Belt and that's not happening organically from new steel in the ground in that region. So we don't see that happening.","Yeah, there is going to be a shifting trade balance as the new capacity comes online. We don't think Chinese tons make sense here anymore, but we're still pretty substantially an import marketplace.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned the favorable start to the ammonia application season. Do you see this in any way detracting from later season demand for urea or UAN?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","No, actually. The total nitrogen need is still there. We had a very strong quarter-end pull of ammonia and then we went into a wet and cool period. You have to also remember we had a poor fall. So the net end need for spring is fairly large and application tendencies have changed a little bit. I think there's a push to get your spring ammonia down. There's also going to be a spring side-dress ammonia season that's going to come.","But a lot of farmers or moving towards split applications with either UAN and urea or going over the top with urea by plane. So what we see today and what we anticipate is a full utilization of the products that have made it into the market and low inventories coming out of Q2. But we have a lot of applications ahead of us in the Northern market, North Dakota, Canada are just kicking off now and going strong. We still have the side-dress season in Indiana and Ohio, this is all for ammonia, and then applications on top. So we anticipate this season running a little bit longer, a little bit bigger, with 92 million acres to 93 million acres of corn and don't anticipate that the fill season will begin until later in the year.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Sandy, on that question, Bert, jump in here, but for 92 million acres, 93 million acres, we would normally anticipate about 4 million tons of ammonia hitting the ground.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","More. 4.5 million tons.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","4.5 million tons. So, given the poor fall, you have to have all of these tons go down otherwise there's a nitrogen deficit and it's tough to get enough urea\/UAN to make up for the quantum of molecules, the impact you have in ammonia tons.","But what's going on with weather today in Brazil, with the negative impact for Brazil, on their second crop corn. You've seen the rally in corn now up to $3.90. I think December it was at $3.85. But you're going to see farmers fertilize for yield. And that extra bump, four, five, six, seven, eight bushels is money in their pocket. We anticipate that will come from nitrogen.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. And then when you think about the medium term supply\/demand balance for the nitrogen industry, what's your approximation where benchmark global urea operating rates could be in 2020? And how does this compare to your expectations for the level at which CF will be able to operate its facilities?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So, look, we're one of the lowest cost producers globally and given North Americas and the import marketplace, we're going to run 24\/7\/365. And I think the question isn't quite as easy as what's the aggregate operating rate because I think what happens is those people that are comfortably cash flow positive are going to run near 100%. They're going to keep their plants running. Those that are on the fringe are going to try as hard as they can to continue to run and it's those that are really at the high cost ones that are going to open the lead shutdown permanently. And we see most of those shutdowns happening in China, maybe some in Eastern Europe but...","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Then the announcements out of Kuwait, Egypt's been having gas...","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Trinidad's got some curtailment problems and others. So there are some disruptions in other parts of the world, but in terms of permanent shutdowns, most of that I think is going to be China and Middle East, I'm sorry, and the Eastern Europe. And otherwise you're going to see a very high operating rate for those assets that are cash flow positive.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you very much","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. On Chinese coal prices on slide nine, you indicate no perceptible response to oil price changes. Do you think that's a lag issue and it still coming or do you think the linkage is now much weaker than it's been in the past because of the global oversupply in coal?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","No, I mean, I think that the dynamics around where the coal price change in China are not related to the oil price at all. It's absolutely related to \u2013 when we were over there, one of the things Bert and I consistently heard was the domestic coal price, the domestic coal price and where that's sat and it's not directly linked to external energy sources that you can track back to.","A lot of it has to do fundamentally with just what's the cost of production and distribution within the country and that's been relatively firm and as Bert says, if anything, we see that likely ticking up instead of staying flat or going lower. So we don't see that being directly connected necessarily with the external energy environment, which is why when oil price was $90 or $100 you didn't see it, coal price in China running way up and as oil prices come down, it has had really a muted affect on internal pricing.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Just continuing on with the discussion here about Chinese coal, do you have an estimate of what fraction of China's anthracite-based nitrogen industry receives financial support from local governments and\/or is back-integrated into the anthracite coal production.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","So I'll answer the second half of that and let Bert talk about the first half. We did explore the sort of the question of how much is integrated and the estimates that we got from people there and also looking back at our previous analysis and work in China suggest it's maybe in the \u2013 somewhere in the 10%-ish plus or minus range that's actually integrated with coal production. Other than that, they tend to be more standalone facilities, not integrated with coal mining or ownership activity.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","And so Steve on the question of \u2013 I'm a little uncomfortable getting an exact percentage. I just don't have that today.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And in the U.S. markets, I wanted to drill in a little bit about a precision Ag trend and that is, there's a couple of software programs out there in the corn belt to predict residual nitrogen midseason, wanted your view on those as to whether they might have an impact on nitrogen use trends and\/or maybe a shift towards UAN?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So we're a big proponent of precision Ag and work with a lot of our larger, more sophisticated customers to how we could help serve that whole trend, because coupled with precision Ag and the 4R's and the proper utilization of our products only lead to good outcomes, which is higher yield, more efficient use, more environmentally friendly practices and we're a big supporter.","And, yes, that is the trend you're seeing is that UAN over time we believe in split applications coupled with possibly other products or adding different products along with UAN, ammonium thiosulfate's continued to grow because of the need for S. So a lot of these coupled together, you'll see the better, and this is why you're seeing consolidation in this space that the better, more financially solid retail groups are moving towards the service providing and value-creating aspects of precision Ag for the farmer.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","And, Steve, to tag along with Bert's answer there, ultimately where we see that headed is higher crop density. The more precision, the improvements in the seed, you get higher densities of crop which then actually the way we project it, increases the amount of nitrogen per unit of land as opposed to the other way around. And so, in aggregate, we think this is a very favorable trend not only because of the environmental and social aspects of what Bert talked about, but also just because we view consumption and demand increasing in North America as a result of that.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Matthew Korn with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Is there anything \u2013 I was very curious about your commentary around the distribution assets and how hard running, I'm curious whether there's been anything meaningful that's changed with your costs on the distribution and transportation side.","And also similarly, have ramp-up operations at Donaldsonville caused any other near-term inefficiencies or are there any other costs that might be rolling on or rolling off? Because really what I'm trying to figure out is ex the natural gas noise, which you all are delineating, are there any shifts in your cost structure, kind of product-by-product that I should notice going into the second quarter or the third quarter?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, Matthew a couple of things. One of which is, as we announced relative to the TNH business we had in unscheduled downtime in Verdigris for one of our ammonia plants and that also carried on to one of the UAN plants there as well. And so, as a result of unscheduled downtime we ended up with a fair bit of fixed overhead absorption into that business without the corresponding production times that go along with it.","On the distribution side, Bert has really led some investments that we've made at the distribution terminals to allow them to both receive inbound and also export outbound ammonia more quickly, which allows us to have the kind of results we did at Blair and in the first quarter leading into the second quarter. And so as some of the initiative like the 4R's that Bert talked about, means that we see likely less ammonia going down in the fall, being able to really pump it out hard in the spring is a critical thing. And that's part of the reason why we made the investments that we've had is to really ship and be able to move those tons quickly.","The other thing that you got to look at I'd say Matthew is, we do have now both the urea and UAN plants at Donaldsonville operating. And so we do have quite a bit more depreciation expense that's going to be rolling through the P&L than what we've had in the past. And as we bring on the diesel ammonia plant and then Port Neal, you're going to see those depreciation numbers continue to climb. So while that's an important thing to look at again, we really focused on cash flow generation and so our focus, the thing that we would point you to is, really take a hard look at how much operating cash flow we're generating going forward. That's a much better metric than the distortion of what the new depreciation is, is going to be in terms of the underlying health and economics of the business.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks Tony. That's actually very helpful. Let me then follow-up with another question regarding your China trip. I'm curious whether you got a sense that there was indeed much better than the \u2013 the Chinese domestic demand for nitrogen over this past season and whether you sense any risk that, that demand rises up over the next several weeks that there's expectations that the exports could see an uptick later on into the summer?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So we did see, the domestic demand but a lot of changes were taking place in Chinese agriculture and you've been reading about these and seeing pictures. We still have a lot of smaller operations in the South. As you go North, you're seeing a lot of bigger, some of the state-owned operations are fairly large, and so we do see some positive trends. There is a huge domestic market, estimates are when you include industrial demand as well as agricultural demand for urea and ammonium sulfate, it is large. And I do think it's going to grow.","The change in crop subsidies or corn and how that's going to impact probably will have some change but I don't think as much as people are anticipating. So relative to as they roll off their domestic demand period and enter Q2 into Q3, we think exports we said are going to be around 10 million tons for the year. We are still with that number, so off about 4 million tons from last year. I think there's going to be some prolonged downtimes in several plans, I don't think you're going to see the push to stuff the ports for exports. We have to see this develop and see if our hypothesis holds true.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck for the rest of the season","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Thanks, Matthew. I want to highlight that last point that Bert mentioned and he mentioned it earlier, I think it's a really good one, which is everyone we spoke with and, in fact, the General Manager of the Port operations at Yantai called this out as well, which is the producers are not just blindly shipping product into the port and then have it available for the traders to cover short positions into India on tenders the way they used to. They're being much more rational about only taking product to port and they've made some investments on rail load-out in load-in infrastructure and so forth in order to be able to move quickly.","And so they're waiting until they actually see business that they want to take before they start moving product to port and that's one of the reasons that they claim anyway that they've had some better discipline in terms of pricing into some of these tenders this year than they have in the past, which is, it's fundamentally different behavior on the part of the producers and they're getting away from letting the traders just short these tenders like crazy and then go into the overflowing ports to cover. And so we think not only is the rationalization of capacity improving the overall market dynamics, but the behavioral aspect of it is really important as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA. Your line is now open.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Tony, I want to be respectful of not commenting on OCI. But if I remember correctly, you said that OCI would be very helpful in your Latin access for Donaldsonville. And I think you're saying today that you're doing pretty well without it. So can you just remind us what the differences? And then second easy question, can you remind us where you are with Wever?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, so, Mark, one of the benefits in terms of the OCI transaction is the trading entity that they have in Dubai. And it allows for very efficient trading of products out of Donaldsonville into other parts of the world. That's not to say that we don't have access to those markets. And, I n fact, Bert and his team have developed those relationships all across the globe. And it's not an issue of access to those demand centers or ability to get product there; it's more the efficiency.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","The efficiency of how you do it. Okay, super. That's very helpful. And can you just give us an update on Wever?","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","So I'd say, Mark, OCI is a publicly traded company. Wever is their project. It's much more appropriate to allow them to answer any questions related to Wever. I wouldn't want someone else answering the question about how Donaldsonville (50:12). I don't feel appropriate answering questions on Wever.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","That's fair. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. A lot of ground has been covered, but I wanted to return, Bert, to the comment you made about the subsidies in China on the demand outlook medium-term. And you said, you don't think the impact is as big as some people think. And I maybe want you to expand on that a little bit. We heard some talk about some pretty sizable reductions in corn acres in China. They have application rates that for nitrogen at least that are pretty close to Western levels. And wanted to just get your thoughts on why you don't think the domestic demand impact from subsidy change will be as big as people think.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So I think you're focused on the corn subsidies, not the production of fertilizer subsidies. Is that correct?","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, on the demand side","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Okay. So, look, China, as we said about fertilizer, I'd say the same thing about corn. And China has been changing. They have subsidized corn production to the tune of $9 a bushel we expect. And those numbers are coming off. They have had, as with other commodity products, high levels of storage and stored material for food security. And what we expect with that is that these subsidies will (51:45) corn of good quality, we don't think it is. And that some of that corn will be sold in different ways or possibly even dumped.","But I think we're in the middle of a changing market. And how that totally impacts the total N number, because corn we replaced with another product, probably wheat or cotton or something else, and so I can't give you what that \u2013 is it 1 million tons, 6 million tons of urea equivalent? I don't have that number","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Adam, the other thing that we heard also from a number of the participants over there is there are some subsidy things that can come in and go, but it's hard to reverse thousands of years of behavior and practice. And the Chinese farmers look at urea as being the really critical, important element of fertilization for yield. And even though there's some view of balanced fertilization needs to increase, the sense that we got from the people over there is they don't expect much of a change.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. And then maybe you talked about Donaldsonville production rates that are already running rate above nameplate and that's something that you think is sustainable. Maybe help size the magnitude there and what kind of output levels from the new plants you think are actually achievable medium-term maybe above nameplate. Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - President, Chief Executive Officer and Director","Yeah, so Donaldsonville urea is running north of 10% above nameplate. So nameplate is 3,850 tons and we've seen rates north of 4,500 tons, 4,800 tons a day. So that plant is really humming along. And on the UAN plant, the nameplate on that is \u2013 and everything I'm giving you is short tons, is 5,050 tons a day. And we've seen rates north of 5,800 tons. And again, as I've said, we haven't really even pushed it to max rates yet. And so we think 20% is likely achievable at D'ville UAN. So it was already the largest single-train UAN plant in the world, even at nameplate. We're getting much, much better results than that already.","And the way that we went about designing these plants was understanding from a process flow perspective where the bottlenecks were, what the things we needed to outsize were, and that's the same approach we've taken on the ammonia plant as well as at Port Neal and so while it's a little early to claim victory on the ammonia production yet, our expectation is that we're going to be in a same kind of region relative to production on the ammonia and also at Port Neal.","And the important thing to also highlight Adam is that when we did the original investment thesis and justification, it was strictly based on nameplate production. So every incremental ton that we're getting off of these plants show up at that 50% to 60% cash margin number and all of those are just free cash into the equation on the economics of the plant, so we feel very good about where we are.","Adam L. Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Two questions on pricing, one near-term, Bert you talked about high mix of non-core and build ammonia in Q1, how does that mix change as you get into Q2 and between having higher proportion of corn belt sales and not much of a forward order book I assume that you'll be able to capture most of this recent run-up in corn belt ammonia pricing? And then longer term, as we look into second half of this year with more capacity coming online, are you seeing pressure from distributors to have price protection on nitrogen products like they've been getting on potash for virtually all potash now is price protected from the manufacture?","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","So, for the near-term you're correct that ammonia in Q1 for Ag application, we did get April pulled into March, but we're still going to see a very healthy Q2 application period. We work through April, we're into May, and again as we march forward that northerly tier start to kicking in. So don't have exact number for you, but we're planning on historical spring six-month period. We look at this as a six-month cycle and for spring. And pricing you're right, you're correct it did rally quite a bit from $100 to $150 a ton and we did have tons available to sell and we anticipate that we have captured pretty good part of that.","You're correct there is capacity coming online in UAN for us urea with CF and some others as well as ammonia. The price protection is not in the mix where we have seen happen with potash and phosphate on price protection is it's really a short-term gain long-term loss. Then as you put product in the inventory for periods like the spring when you could have had price appreciation, you do not get that. And it creates a negative dynamic in the market that the risk stays with the producer and you continue to push that product out from logistical basis and it just doesn't help the market at all.","We believe that we need to price our products appropriately for our retail and wholesale customers and that the risk then stays with them and they get a reward when they sell and they provide services, they provide different product. It's part of their product portfolio. We're just one participant in that chain. And so we just don't see that price protection has a future in North America at least in nitrogen it doesn't.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay, thank you.","Bert A. Frost - Senior Vice President, Sales, Distribution, and Market Development","Said different way, being the largest producer globally and larger than the next six combined in North America, we have no interest in completely unwilling to engage in that kind of practice and will find a way where liquidity is achieved in the marketplace so that that doesn't happen here at least in nitrogen.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today. I would like to turn the call back to Dan Aldridge for closing remarks.","Dan A. Aldridge - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Liz. That concludes our call for today.

My name is Danielle, I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Sir, please proceed.","Dan Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Swenson, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. And with me are Steve Wilson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Market Development; and Tony Will, our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its second quarter 2013 results yesterday afternoon, as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","During this call and in the associated slides and our earnings press release, we make reference to certain adjusted or as adjusted financial results. These adjustments relate to the modification to the selling price methodology used for products sold by Canadian Fertilizers Limited or CFL. This modification impacts the comparability of the financial results between the 2012 and 2013 periods. To facilitate period-to-period comparisons of the company's underlying operating performance, we are presenting certain financial information on an adjusted basis, as if the modified selling price calculation methodology had been in effect from January 1, 2012 through April 30, 2013, when we closed the acquisitions of the remaining outstanding interest of CFL. Please refer to the exhibits and reconciliation in the press release or on Slides 14 through 16 of the presentation accompanying this call. These adjustments impacted revenue and gross profit, but did not affect CF Industries' economics, EBITDA, net earnings or earnings per share.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws.

Consider all forward-looking statements in light of those and other risks and uncertainties, and do not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Steve Wilson, our Chairman and CEO.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2013, we experienced challenging fertilizer market and business conditions, but our solid execution resulted in a seamless support of customers and strong financial results for the company. As detailed in our press release published yesterday afternoon, CF Industries generated net earnings of $498 million and diluted earnings per share of $8.38 on sales of $1.7 billion and a gross profit margin of over 50%.","These results are notable as our earnings per share was the second highest on record. Our Nitrogen business had a new revenue record in the quarter, and gross margin for that segment was second only to the record set in the second quarter last year when average daily natural gas market prices were 44% lower than they were this year.","These results reflect the inherent advantages of our business model and our ability to execute effectively across varying market conditions. We produce these strong financial results while facing challenges during the quarter, principally due to weather, but also from other related industry conditions.","Several regions in North America experienced nearly continuous cool and wet weather through May. This weather was notable for some of the new records that were set, as areas in the Corn Belt received precipitation that was 3 to 6 inches above normal. One of these records was set in Iowa, the largest corn-producing state, which experienced its wettest March to May period on record. This unusually cool and wet weather was not unique to North America, as Europe, Russia and China experienced similar conditions.","These conditions resulted in a late start to planting, and many farmers were forced to forgo preplant direct ammonia application because of the limited time window open to get seed in the ground. This led to increased demand for UAN and the resulting products which enclaved [ph] to our strength as a full-line nitrogen supplier with a broad distribution footprint.","A follow-on impact of the global delays and planning in fertilizer application was the buildup of inventory industry-wide. With 97 million acres of corn expected to be planted in the U.S., producers and importers recognized that there would be substantial demand for plant nutrients. The delay in the application season allowed time for inventories to build, which constrained global prices, especially for urea and phosphates.","As the quarter progressed, the season developed strength quietly and without a lot of fanfare, and planting and application accelerated. Weather conditions improved and were conducive to field activity from late May through the end of the quarter. Activity was intense, with the USDA reporting that more than 97 million acres of corn were planted. The high level of planted acres led to a large amount of nitrogen moving through the North American distribution system, as demonstrated by the high volume CF Industries sold this quarter. Product movement was strong through the end of the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had a near-record low urea inventory and believe that industry-wide ammonia and UAN inventories were within the 5-year historical ranges.","Through the quarter, our team worked exceptionally well in overcoming the challenging conditions we faced. On a very personal level, it was a difficult quarter for us as we lost one of our colleagues and 7 other people were injured in the tragic incident that occurred during the turnaround of an ammonia plant at our Donaldsonville nitrogen complex. The safety of our employees, contractors and communities is and will always be our first priority. We will incorporate the lessons we learned from this incident in our operating practices and reinforce our commitment to safety as priority #1.","In addition to the turnaround at that particular ammonia plant, we had other turnarounds and carried out a precautionary shutdown of our Medicine Hat nitrogen complex due to flooding along the South Saskatchewan River. These contributed to our ammonia system as a whole, running at only 92% of capacity during the quarter. This is a lower rate than we have averaged over the past several quarters, but taking plants down for regular maintenance and to protect them against threats such as flooding is consistent with our approach of assuring the safe operating condition of our plants.","Our sales team did an excellent job building a strong order book early in the year during a period of attractive prices, especially for ammonia and UAN. Their ability to find the best available opportunities contributed to higher year-over-year average prices for both ammonia and UAN. Our sales team also identified attractive urea and UAN export opportunities that have positioned us well for this fall.","We continue to be good financial stewards. Early in the quarter, we issued $1.5 billion of bonds with 10- and 30-year maturities at an average coupon of 4.2%. The timing of this financing was fortuitous as it coincided with the bottoming of benchmark treasury yields. And during the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million shares of our common stock for $474 million. Including activity through August 5, our year-to-date share purchases totaled more than 5.8 million shares or about 9% of our shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. The more than $1.1 billion of cash returned through these repurchases, plus the $49 million of dividend paid so far this year, equal almost 10% of our average market capitalization. We believe these share repurchases represent great value and provide the long-term benefit of increasing nitrogen capacity per share for remaining shareholders.","Shortly after the end of the quarter, we received the air permits required for our capacity expansion projects in Louisiana and Iowa. The receipt of these permits helps clear the way for us to begin construction activity at both sites, which we expect will occur in the next several weeks.","With that, let me hand the call over to Dennis to share the financial details from the quarter and year-to-date.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. During the second quarter of 2013, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $498 million or $8.38 per diluted share. This compares to $606 million or $9.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2012.","Our second quarter 2013 earnings included a pretax unrealized loss on natural gas derivatives of approximately $18 million and pretax gains on foreign currency derivatives of $4 million. The net impact of these 2 items was a decrease of $0.15 in after-tax earnings per diluted share.","First half share repurchases made under our $3 billion repurchase program increased our second quarter earnings per share by $0.53, reflecting a 6% decrease in our weighted average diluted share count for the second quarter.","As Steve shared earlier, our Nitrogen business performed exceptionally well during the second quarter. The segment had record quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion and its second highest quarterly gross margin of $847 million. We delivered 3.6 million tons of nitrogen products and achieved a gross margin of 55.5%, which you can see on Slide 6.","The decrease in segment gross margin is due primarily to the swing from a noncash mark-to-market gain of $78 million on natural gas derivatives in the second quarter of 2012 to a mark-to-market loss of $18 million in the second quarter of 2013. It also reflects realized natural gas costs of $3.78 -- $3.79 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2013 compared to $3.13 per MMBtu a year ago. We currently have spot agreements covering 90% of plant production for August through November at an average price of $3.67 per MMBtu.","During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 833,000 tons of ammonia at an average realized price of $704 per ton. Ammonia volume for the second quarter of 2013 was 5% higher than a year ago, primarily due to a later start to the application season in 2013 compared to the exceptionally early start in 2012, which pulled ammonia demand into the first quarter of that year. Our average ammonia price was 11% higher than in the second quarter of last year due to a strong forward order book entering the application season and a robust demand that developed during the quarter.","Second quarter sales of granular urea increased from 694,000 tons to 704,000 tons due to export sales and higher agricultural sales, especially into Western Canada. Our average price decreased from $522 per ton or an adjusted average of $507 to $385 per ton due to global delays in fertilizer application and expectations for higher Chinese exports.","During the second quarter of 2013, we sold 1.6 million tons of UAN, essentially unchanged from 2012. The average UAN price increased from $324 to $341 per ton due to an attractively priced forward order book and strong demand as some farmers switched from ammonia to UAN due to the late start of the application season.","As shown on Slide 7, our Phosphate segment achieved total revenues during the quarter of $190 million, down about 18% from the second quarter of 2012. Total sales volume was 421,000 tons in 2013 compared to 493,000 tons in 2012. The decrease in volume was due to lower domestic and international product demand. Average phosphate price realizations during the second quarter were lower than in 2012 due to muted global demand. And the segment generated a 9.5% gross margin, down from 21.8% reported a year ago, as a result of lower average selling prices and higher production costs.","Thanks to the strength of our Nitrogen business, these quarterly results represent a very healthy first half for CF Industries. Total first half revenues were $3.1 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the prior year. And first half volume was 7.5 million tons compared to 7.7 million tons in the prior year period. Total EBITDA for the 6-month period was $1.6 billion, while gross margin was 50% of sales. Net earnings to common stockholders was $905 million, which including the impact of share repurchase activity, resulted in earnings per diluted share of $14.80.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. We have a cost-advantaged North American footprint that allows us to generate strong earnings under varying market conditions and that positions us well for long-term growth. And we believe that the current agricultural and fertilizer market conditions are conducive to plant nutrient demand and our near-term profitability.","Corn remains a very profitable cash crop for farmers, with futures prices reflecting the market's assumption that the industry will return to more normal stocks following this year's harvest. Of course, the actual stocks use depends on weather between now and late October, which will determine the size of this year's harvest. With fall 2014 futures pricing corn at about $5 per bushel, farmers can expect to earn very attractive returns next year from corn relative to other crops. Based on today's futures prices, corn will generate a significant premium over soybeans, including the cost of fertilizers.","Given this profit differential, we project that farmers will plant about 92 million acres of corn in 2014. Although the planted area will represent about a 5% decrease from what has been reported as planted in 2013, total acres planted through all crops is expected to decline by just 1%, resulting in expected nitrogen demand of 13.3 million nutrient tons in fertilizer year 2014, modestly below the estimated 13.5 million tons in 2013. This is an historically robust level of nitrogen demand.","Ammonia demand is projected to be healthy this fall in light of planting expectations for next year. We believe we have an appropriate amount of inventory and planned production so that our system can meet this demand and our commitments to customers.","UAN side-dress application continued very late this year, providing us with a high level of spot sales opportunities through June and even into July. We delayed the start of our UAN summer fill program into July and benefited from strong customer interest.","In the urea market, prices in the U.S. Gulf have tested floor levels. The Chinese low tariff export window opened on July 1, and that seasonally available product has been moving to various regions. Notable among these regions is India, which has experienced a more normal monsoon season this year, improving planting conditions in that country. We're all aware that subsidy programs and currency fluctuations impact India's purchasing behavior, but fundamental planting and crop economic conditions are favorable for urea demand.","We expect that the projected modestly lower nitrogen demand in the U.S. will result in lower urea imports in the new fertilizer year. Just as we did in this most recent quarter, we will seek the best sales opportunities for our products, whether through domestic or export sales.","The phosphate market looks challenging in the near term with modest global demand and substantial available production. However, the recent declines in ammonia and sulphur prices will help margins by reducing production costs. Longer term, the plant nutrient market presents good opportunities for increased earnings. Growth in global population and a shift to higher-protein diets continue to drive a greater need for grains to feed the world. These demand factors support our 2% annual growth expectation for the world nitrogen market. This growth translates into the need for 4 or 5 worldscale ammonia urea complexes to be built each year to satisfy demand.","While some of our peers have announced indefinite delays to their nitrogen expansion plans, none of them has cited the lack of expected product demand as a reason. We are pleased to be in the vanguard of North American capacity additions.","We have met with a number of long-term oriented investors following our Investor Day event in June. These conversations have been valuable as we, as a management team, continue to learn more about what is important to the type of investors that make up the majority of our shareholder base. While the detailed points vary from investor to investor, we did hear consistent feedback, encouraging us to keep doing what has led to our successful track record: Managing the business with a focus on safety and operational excellence, investing selectively in growth projects with attractive return profiles and aggressively returning cash to shareholders through dividends and a value-oriented share buyback program.","We continue to have a significant amount of discussion with investors, among management and with our Board of Directors about what methods of returning cash to shareholders are most appropriate for CF Industries. We are -- and we continuously assess the best path forward in this dimension of our business. To date, our analysis led us to the belief that executing share buybacks has been the best way for us to return cash to shareholders, especially since we believe that the earnings potential of the company is not fully reflected in the market price of our stock. Our actions this past quarter to issue debt while continuing to buy back shares were oriented towards improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and increasing the leverage our shareholders have to our business model. We are proud of the shareholder value created by CF Industries and are glad that the strength of our business provides us with the wonderful challenge of considering a variety of options for both increasing and returning the value of that enterprise. We welcome input from our shareholders on this topic.","With that, we'll now open the line to answer your questions. Danielle?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Steve, just want to get an update on your supply demand outlook for U.S. nitrogen. We've seen, as you mentioned, 2 cancellations by some of your peers due to soaring construction costs, and there's likely to be another one soon. So can you comment on cost escalation in general and what you're doing to mitigate that, whether you're going to come in on budget as originally expected? And what's your current view on how many significant expansions we might see in the U.S., either greenfield or brownfield, and what that does to sustainability of the net import status of the U.S. in nitrogen?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. So far on our 2 major projects, we have made great, great progress in specifying the engineering costs and nailing down the cost of major components that are being fabricated by fabricators for us. And with respect to those 2 sections of the project cost, we are very comfortable with how they're coming in relative to our budget. They're essentially in line with our expectations. We are in the process now of looking at -- entering into competitive bidding for the construction costs element of the projects. That represents roughly half of the total project cost, and we'll have more clarity on that aspect of the project cost when we complete the competitive bidding process. With respect to the number of projects that are likely to be built, there's certainly a lot of discussion about that. There are a number of projects that are moving along. There are others that have been canceled, there are others that are in decision mode. We don't have any more clarity than the general market has on that point.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And just to clarify, how long would you expect the U.S. to remain a net importer of nitrogen? I realize it varies across the 3 major product types, but how long do you think that window will remain?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, certainly, our projects are coming online in 2015 and '16. We expect there to continue to be substantial imports of nitrogen at the time we complete our projects, and we actually don't see anything on the horizon that's going to flip that for a number of years.","Operator","And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, Steve, if we can think ahead to the fall season in the U.S., can you speak a little bit about the timing of the U.S. harvest and how important that will be relative to the size of the fall application season? And I guess sort of as a follow through, if we have a long or short fall application season, what does that mean for sort of the setup going into spring next year in terms of where inventory levels may shake out over the winter?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. Bert Frost will handle that.","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. And regarding the fall and the harvest and the size of the harvest and the timing of the applications, what we expect to see is, obviously, with the late maturing crop, it may come off later, but I think that farmers would take advantage of drying capabilities and be buying and utilizing propane to drive down the corn and get it into the silo. I actually think this moves to our advantage because as that timing is compressed and there are certain areas of the United States where fall applications make more sense than the spring, that those areas then will need to utilize our capabilities, which is a rapid response and the ability to quickly supply product to the market and then resupply again in as short as a 2-week window, and so that's where we would leverage our terminal system and pipeline and rail service to those terminals to allow the farmers to pull product as quickly as possible and apply it. Obviously, that's weather-driven later in the quarter in Q4. You could see, if we do see an early snow, that would be a negative impact, but we have that problem every year. So whether it goes to spring or not, some markets are naturally spring applicators and some are naturally fall applicators, but we're projecting a robust fall and a robust fall application of ammonia.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up -- not as a follow-up but as a housekeeping question. The CapEx number that you gave in the press release, there were 2 numbers, there is the one for the brownfield or new plants and then there was a $450 million number. Was that -- is that a maintenance number or does that have some debottlenecks or other type of activity in it as well?","Stephen R. Wilson","Go ahead, Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes. If you look at our gross spending for the quarter, what we've gotten this quarter is we got $250 million of spending, of which $115 million, $116 million was for the expansions in Donaldsonville and in Port Neal. The other part of the $250 million is going to have to do with turnarounds and to some degree, some debottleneck projects that we have ongoing in the system. If we look at it, Vincent, year-to-date, we've got $402 million of gross spending, $181.5 million of which are applicable to the expansion projects at D-ville and at Port Neal, and on the balance of which, again, is devoted to maintenance, sustaining CapEx and also some debottleneck projects as well and some other construction projects of the plants like tank construction and what have you. So that's sort of what's happened so far this year. As we look ahead to the balance of the year, what we're looking at is a total -- for the guidance for the total year is between $1 billion and $1.3 billion of total CapEx spend, and we believe that about $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion of that will be for the big projects at D-ville and in Iowa, and then the balance again is going to be between sustaining and the debottlenecking and other construction projects that aren't associated with the big projects.","Stephen R. Wilson","Vincent, with respect to the $450 million, that is above trend line for maintenance CapEx because of the number of turnarounds we have and because of some discretionary projects, including some small debottlenecks that are in there.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just where would you think that number would be going forward for next year, or too soon to tell?","Dennis P. Kelleher","I think if you look at maintenance CapEx going forward, we're probably looking at between $300 million and $350 million a year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You mentioned one of the reasons for the recent decline in ammonia was due to offshore producers shifting from urea to ammonia. In your view, what inning do you think this game is in, given the spread has recently narrowed, and how do you see this going forward?","Stephen R. Wilson","I'm sorry, could you repeat your first question?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry. I said, given the -- you mentioned in your release that one of the reasons for the declines in ammonia was due to offshore production shifting from urea to ammonia. What inning do you think this game is in and how do you see this going forward?","Stephen R. Wilson","What inning do we think this game is in? I don't know what game you're talking about, but I'll just comment on this general development. The fact that some offshore producers shifted from urea to ammonia is indicative we think of support for our cost curve globally for urea. The fact that those producers found the ammonia market to be more attractive than urea at the price level it fell to, we view it frankly as a positive long-term indicator for the strength of our cost position. With respect to where we are in the evolution of urea prices generally, we've tested this general floor level several times over the last few years, and we believe that our look at that global cost curve and the margin implications is intact.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And just kind of a derivative of that question. Can you just offer a little more color on the mix benefit opportunities between UAN and how you see this in the second half versus the first half?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. I assume what you mean by the mixed benefits is in the composition of the options available to CF, whether that's urea, UAN, ammonia or ammonium nitrate, depending on the plant. UAN, because it's consumed 3 to 4 months out of the year, predominately in the spring, it's a build season which we've just entered, which is the July through March period where our customers are building their inventory in preparation for spring, which again, like ammonia, is a very quick dump. And so what we've just completed in our summer fill program over the last month was pricing that product to our customers, and now we're beginning the shipping period. So we're very comfortable with the forward position for the United States market, as well as the options that are available to us in the world market. Our urea inventory, as we mentioned in the press release, was very low entering Q3, and we're going to be continuing to produce at full rates for our urea capability or capacity. But our other products are also in a low-inventory state. So we see many options for us going forward and market options in our ability to capture profitable sales.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Korn from Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, a lot of news recently and the market's now anticipating a large drop in potash prices should the industry shift, as it looks like it might. Would you anticipate any impact on nitrogen demand at the margin or in the growth rate going forward as an effect of like a rebalancing of nitrogen versus potassium costs? And secondly, if we were to see a divergence in the pricing direction between like corn and soybeans between now and when farmers make their planting decisions this spring, how much of that 92 million acres would you say is practically at risk, would it be 4, 6, 8, more or less, just would like your opinion there, too?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. With respect to the first question on potash, we're not in the potash business, but frankly, nitrogen demand goes with planting. And if farmers are going to plant 92 million acres of corn, they will fertilize to that level at optimal levels. The economics are very, very favorable for corn planting. There hasn't been any diminution of nitrogen demand because of potash prices being at some higher level than they might be in the future. Nitrogen demand is pretty inelastic with respect to demand for the other nutrients. And Bert, on the other question?","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. Regarding corn and soy and the price structure that's currently in place on the Chicago Board of Trade, what I think would be more likely is that your outer reaches -- your marginal acres in the world and specifically Mato Grosso for the second-crop corn, the safrinha, that will go in, in January and February of 2014 would be most at risk. Your outer reaches there, Sapezal, Lucas do Rio Verde would probably be okay, Sorriso, those regions that plant the second-crop corn and have fertilized more in recent years, and those yields have gone up and you're seeing that expressed in Brazil's exports of corn, and as well as the pricing for corn probably would decrease. And I think that would support the corn levels that we're talking about for the United States, and that's just a yield and the infrastructure ability to move that corn at a fair price for a farmer. And so the next probably level for the United States would be dryland corn, and that's going to be competing with wheat. And where wheat on the stocks-to-use ratio is today, it's still more attracted to plant dryland corn in the Oklahoma, Kansas regions that are currently planting today. And so I would say on the corn-soybean balance, it's still favorable to corn and probably will be just due to supply and demand factors in the world and planting costs around the world.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, with regard to your planned expansions at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, just curious as to whether CF has been approached by any companies interested in partnering with CF, either as a financial partner that would defray capital costs or perhaps as a business partner willing to baseload the incremental capacity? And if so, are there any scenarios under which that might make sense for the company in your view?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, our projects are 100% owned by us. We're very confident of our ability to construct the projects and operate them and sell the product. So we don't have any plans along those lines.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So most likely scenario is go alone then. Okay. And then just curious, on cash return to shareholders, I appreciate the magnitude that's occurred year-to-date, but just curious on the dividend, Steve, it's been stable for about 2 years or so. Do you care to comment on whether or not you would see any potential to increase the payout level in coming quarters?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I made a comment in my prepared remarks on that general subject. We are very pleased to be in a position of generating lots of cash and having lots of optionality with respect to how to deploy that cash. We talk about that deployment on a regular basis among ourselves as a management team with our board. And we're certainly open to reexamining, frankly, everything we do if good ideas are presented to us. Should we change our views, certainly, we'll communicate that at the time we do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Tiberio from Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess looking at the sharp decline in ammonia prices, particularly in the mid-Corn Belt, I've received several questions from investors, just wondering if retailers are taking product during this period and prices are still declining, is there the risk that retail pricing is not adjusted fast enough heading into the fall application season to kind of support the fall demand that you're talking about even in a compressed window? So I just wanted to, I guess, get your insight into whether you think that is a meaningful risk on the margin that farmers could maybe delay some of the purchasing into spring if we don't get that retail adjustment quick enough.","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. And so it's an interesting question relative to risk and market optionality. Market prices are changing daily at times. And so, yes, we're going to see a correction, and we've already seen that with ammonia pricing to our customers, which tend to be the retailers and wholesalers and traders. And so, I think those prices have already corrected. We've already launched our fill program and are having dialogue with each of our customer bases regarding the product mix that they will need. Retailers are taking ownership but, generally, that ownership still rests with the producer, with us, with our terminal system. There's a summer fill program that takes place in June and July. That is a quick fill, but that retail space is fairly limited. And then they rely on the producers in the larger terminals throughout the Midwest that are on the pipeline and are along the river to make those sales. So we have to position that product for fall sales and generally do that tying it through sales. So we're selling the product, positioning in the terminals and then preparing our barge and pipeline movements to meet that demand. And so, will the adjustment be fast enough? I think farmers right now are focused on their crop and rightly so. They've planted the crop, it's growing, it looks like we're going to have a fairly large harvest. And so, I think as that product gets closer to maturity, then the attention will be placed on planting next year's and preparing the nutrients. But farmers are smart people, they're economic beings in their heart and they're trying to figure out the lowest cost price to put that crop in the ground to achieve the maximum yield. So they will focus on nitrogen. And we believe that by October or September, the majority of those decisions will have been made, and we will have our product priced, sold and prepared to go to the ground in November.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","That's great insight. Just one follow-up question. I noticed that in the Pakistan tender today that we did see a small bounce on urea prices. Should we view this as just another event and continued volatility in international prices? Or are you of the view that with the size of the recent tenders that we've seen in the international markets that maybe we're at the point that we could actually start building somewhat of a positive base heading out of the low-tariff window for Chinese exports?","Bert A. Frost","Okay. So a lot of questions in that one. Look, urea prices have been very volatile over the last several years, hitting the floor that Steve mentioned, this $300 level short ton U.S., short ton NOLA, rising all the way last year in April to $740, and then back down. So prices will continue to be volatile to world -- of globally traded product. And today, I think you've hit on the right point that China is driving this market with the abundance of exports that are expected in Q2. The market anticipated that level of exports. It's now being realized in Q3, and we anticipate that to wind down through Q3 and probably will bleed out into Q4. But from what's coming out in the publications and from our own investigations, with the cost of anthracite coal and the production cost and logistical cost to put that product into the Chinese bonded warehouses and onto a vessel, there is not much of a profit option available to a Chinese producer. So what is happening? We are seeing less tonnage shipped to the ports. And so by the end of Q3, a scenario could be painted that there will be less available to export as this program winds down. So is the Pakistani tender a reflection of that? Possibly. But demand has been robust for nitrogen this year. India has taken a significant level, and we expect that India could be at an all-time high for urea imports. Pakistan, Brazil and other markets are doing the same. And so the tenders did start later, but they have been bigger, and that is helping to sustain, I think, at this floor level. So I do think you can build a case for higher prices worldwide going into 2014, and that should spur, I think, appropriate behavior. And we're, I'd say, positive going forward for the options to CF.","Stephen R. Wilson","I think if we take this subject and bring it back to CF Industries, it's important for us to all realize that nitrogen will continue to be a cyclical and seasonal business. There will be significant moves in prices. But the beauty of our position is with sub-$4 gas and urea prices in the range that we're talking about right now, there's plenty of money to be made at this company. And we are seeing reinforcement of our thesis that we're in a sustained period of higher lows and higher highs. That is a great band to be operating in.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think the USDA thinks that the corn yield this year will be 156.5 bushels per acre, and that will plant 97.5 million acres. Is that your view as well, or do you think the numbers will be higher or lower? How has the weather evolved, and how do you see that influencing yield?","Stephen R. Wilson","We don't really have any basis for having a substantially different view. Our thoughts are right in that range.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then you said that you bought back 5.8 million shares so far this year. I think you bought back 5.1 million in the first half. So it seems that your general orientation to your share repurchase program is that your shares represent a good value and that it's better to allocate more capital upfront for your longer-term program. Is that correct? And then the second part is, was there anything unusual about your tax rate in the quarter that elevated it?","Stephen R. Wilson","Jeff, can you just elaborate. I didn't understand your point about the program upfront, what did you mean by that?","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. So you have a multiyear, multibillion-dollar share repurchase program. And it seems like you've bought shares sizably in the first quarter and the second quarter. You continue to buy them in the third quarter, I think. So it sounds like you wish to allocate more of your capital to share repurchase in the early years rather than having it go all the way out, I think your program ends in 2016?","Stephen R. Wilson","It ends at the end of 2016. Our attitude on this, first of all, is that we have plenty of liquidity to execute our share repurchase program and our capacity expansion projects. And I think we've demonstrated that, obviously, by the facts that you cite, Jeff. Our view on deploying capital for share repurchases is that we would like to be able to look back at the end of the program and say we did a good job doing it. Whether we buy more or less in any given month or any given quarter is not particularly pertinent. We gave ourselves a 4-plus-year authorization in order to maintain flexibility. If we don't need all of that flexibility, fine. If we do need it, fine. There's not any particular timetable that's important to us here.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Was there something unusual about your tax rate this quarter?","Stephen R. Wilson","Dennis?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes. If you go back to 2012, Jeff, we had a tax provision in the quarter of $309 million on pretax earnings of $960 million, which gave us a rate of about 32.2% at the time. This year, we had a tax provision of $283 million on pretax earnings of $802 million or a tax rate of about 35.2%. The big change there is, remember that in the pretax earnings that is used for the denominator is included -- or was included, Viterra's share of the earnings of CFL. In 2012, that Viterra share as reported would've included the profit that they earned, selling product at a full mark-to-market basis, okay, so effectively product sale basis. As you wind the clock forward to 2013, we adjusted that so that actually the share of the income that Viterra earns from CFL is at a cost-plus basis. So effectively, what that does is that it pulls down the denominator, pushing up the tax rate, because the tax provisions for -- that you see, that is used in that calculation, is the tax provision for CF's proprietary income. It does not include a tax provision on the income of others. So that's really the big change there.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So what's your tax rate for the year?","Dennis P. Kelleher","We're usually around 35%, and that's what we think we're going to be around this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Farmers tend to think of P&K in a similar fashion. So with the recent change in potash landscape, what is the risk that lower potash prices could spill over into phosphate and drag phosphate's market down?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","This is Bert. A lot of speculation today on what's going to happen in the potash world, and I think you'll hear more about that today from one of our colleagues. Really, as the farmer looks at this, I don't think they're necessarily comparing the potash price to the phosphate price, but they do go on together when you're broadcasting or putting the product down. And so, they're complementary in that sense. You -- I think people on the production side, as well as the traders and wholesalers, do tend to look at those prices to see a relative value sense, but I don't think it's that way for a farmer. He's looking at his overall nutrient needs and trying to economically put down the best choice for him, depending on soil type and seed and other varying issues. So I don't see a spillover.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on your Analyst Day, you explained that cost curve really well, the urea cost curve. You talked about demand of 183 million tons of urea. If U.S. corn acres decline as you expect next year and presumably, global acres also decline, where do you see that demand on the cost curve?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we're talking in the U.S. about a decline in acreage to 92 million acres. 92 million is a lot of corn acres, historically, very high. And I think you may recall that I made a comment that we see the demand for -- on a nutrient ton basis in the U.S. going from 13.5 million tons to 13.3 million tons. That's so small as to almost be lost in the rounding. So we don't see that as a significant event that's going to affect urea demand.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just lastly, quickly, you talked about your urea exports. Was it just opportunistic, and what are your inventories now post these exports?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, this is Bert. For the urea exports, as well as UAN, you could say they're opportunistic. We look at all the opportunities that are available to us at the time. Obviously, we're students of the market, trying to determine where the best option for us on a profitability basis lies. And during the quarter, during Q2, we did export to several countries based on a relative value equivalent to NOLA. And so at that point, that was attractive to us, and we executed those sales. On UAN, we sold to Mexico, France, Belgium, Argentina, Uruguay, and if you consider Canada an export, we also sent product up there. And so those are also options available to us, and that's really a balancing issue. And so, as we look at our production facilities and where they're located and the logistical constraints or options available to them, Donaldson at times makes sense for us to export, and it's an attractive proposition for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Picken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to talk a little bit about your phosphate margins for the quarter. They were a little bit lower sequentially than last quarter, and just sort of wondering when we might see the impact of those lower input costs kind of flow through and whether we should expect a higher gross margin percentage even if DAP prices are falling in the back half of the year?","Stephen R. Wilson","I think, as a very crude rule of thumb, those changes in input costs usually take about a quarter to roll all the way through our system.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. So I guess, was there anything sort of unusual in terms of your raw costs or anything else on the phosphate side?","Stephen R. Wilson","No. It's just been a tough market.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then last question, just switching over back to nitrogen. Could you talk a little bit about the substitutability between UAN and urea, both in the Midwest and then kind of in other parts of the country, like how much would farmers go back and forth between the 2 products based on pricing?","Bert A. Frost","That's an interesting question which we discuss -- we seem to discuss every spring. The absolute switchability, all the products can be switched. Then it depends on equipment. So then there are regional differences on the type of equipment. A producer or a retailer may own if they're doing custom application. And then, again, it gets back to soil type, seed type and what type of farming you're doing. And so, we do -- and this year we did see some switching, and you see that reflected as we discussed in our lower overall ammonia volume on a 6-month basis. We had a huge amount of urea come in to the United States. Almost 1.7 million tons over and above last year's record were imported into the United States. That, coupled with 300,000 tons of UAN, which was over and above last year's level -- this is on a fertilizer year basis -- points to what we expected probably going into Q2 of high level of inventories coming out of Q2. That is not the case. What happened? A lot of that urea was because of the price -- the attractiveness of that value proposition for urea was consumed probably -- and who suffered was the ammonia volume. And so, we talked about that in our quarterly release. But again, inventories coming out of Q2 are fairly low for all the products. So it's an interesting analysis on how that balanced based on the value proposition.","Stephen R. Wilson","The flexibility that some farmers have to shift between urea and UAN and the changes that occur between the relative prices are factors that drove our decision to expand the flexibility of Donaldsonville. To be able to switch between urea and UAN, we can do that quickly, and we're able to capture whichever is the better margin opportunity. We can run a few weeks one way, switch in a short time period, run a few weeks the other way, and we do that regularly.","Bert A. Frost","And we did that this year. And you can see, based on our -- if you look at our production volume, 2013 over 2012, we're almost 300,000 tons higher on UAN as a reflection of that decision we made in January to favor UAN over urea.","Operator","And our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A lot of ground covered on the call today. Maybe I was hoping to get a little more color on the corn acreage outlook and maybe some of the sensitivities to that 92 million acre outlook, specifically, what do you think that does? And I see it in the chart, in the slides, but it's hard to read kind of what it does to bean acreage and wheat and cotton and kind of where -- how you think about the sensitivity of that to its ultimate pricing this fall and maybe upside, potential upside to that acreage number for next year?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we're sitting here with corn crop maturing, awaiting harvest and awaiting if weather patterns are going to develop with respect to the harvest. So we don't really know what the ending position is going to be yet. And so, one of the inputs that's determining the acreage plant next year, a major input, will be what the result is of this year. So there's an assumption in all of this work of having a very strong harvest, a lot of grain put in the bins. And that if we put those factors together and look at the relative economics of various crops, we come out with about 92 million acres next year. There's sure sensitivity to that number, but it's around a very strong market in general. I would point out that in 2011, when we had about 92 million acres or 92.5 million acres of corn, first of all, everybody thought that was a wonderful crop. Secondly, we generated almost $3 billion of EBITDA that year in that kind of scenario. So we -- obviously, these projections will change over time but we don't know which direction.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, I appreciate that. I guess I'm wondering, given some of the CRP acreage that's come into the system, how much is the increase in acreage up into this 97 million range, potentially could be structural for a couple of years, especially given the increase in [indiscernible] in many parts of the Midwest? And if that's the case, you run the risk of more 14 billion bushel potential harvests that could then yet drive corn prices even lower than we are today. I'm just trying to get your view on that balance.","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay, I understand. Bert, do you want to comment on that?","Bert A. Frost","Yes. I think what you're going to see is the marginal acre, as you mentioned, whether that's CRP or dryland farming or even up into Canada what got converted into corn, possibly could go back to other crops, wheat, canola. But I think you're going to see -- you got take it on a global basis with what's going on with corn, soybeans and cotton and the optionality available to different countries. And I would go back to Brazil in Paran\u00e1, probably you won't see as much first-crop corn; as well as Mato Grosso, you won't see as much second-crop corn. What would replace that would be beans. So we see the comparative competitive advantage shift that has been taking place that the U.S. is much stronger in corn, and South America is becoming -- it already has become the advantaged producer for soybeans. Then it goes to the second crop, and I would expect to see cotton produced more in the outer reaches of Mato Grosso shift more to that this year over second-crop corn. So I think our 92-million-acre expectation is pretty solid. Now you have to remember, on a yield basis, if we're projecting, the USDA is at 156, somewhere as high as 166, whatever that number is and you have a 14-billion-bushel crop in the United States, that's unprecedented. And our ability to do that year-on-year has not been consistent. And so, be careful when you project out that we'll have various or multiple years at that level, probably not likely.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Steve, as you think about the seasonality and cyclicality and your mix begins to shift even more dramatically towards nitrogen, do you tend to feel more inclined to look for ways to expand the Phosphate business? Or are you okay with this continual shift towards nitrogen or substantial shift towards nitrogen?","Stephen R. Wilson","Our Phosphate business is a worldscale operation. We have a mine that produces about 3.5 million tons of rock, and that meshes well with our chemical plant. As I'm sure you know, the ability to expand operations in Florida is somewhere between 0 and tiny. We buy small parcels of land that contiguous to our operation when the opportunity arises, adding some tonnage to our reserve base. But certainly, domestic expansion is not a reasonable option. And other places in the world with huge phosphate deposits are not particularly friendly to foreign investment, although we've occasionally looked at those things. And if opportunities were to arise, we'd certainly take a look at them.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question, with Donaldson substantially changing your flexibility to export, does that have any impact on the way you approach hedging? I'm just wondering if the opportunities to hedge are going to look different when you have so much more flexibility.","Stephen R. Wilson","I haven't thought about it that way, Mark. I don't think so. I mean, we look at our gas supply, which is -- which after the expansion will be close to 1 Bcf a day. We try to balance the opportunities that may exist in the market against mitigating some risks. I think we've done a reasonable job through the years. I think just because we're bigger, it's probably not going to change our profile on that. And I -- whether the product heads north or southeast and west, I don't think is necessarily pertinent to how we buy our gas.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today.

Wilson","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday afternoon, CF Industries reported record first quarter net earnings of $407 million or $6.47 per diluted share compared to earnings of $368 million or $5.54 per share in last year's first quarter. Our net earnings and earnings per share set first quarter records, as our employees did an exceptional job operating the business.","Last year, we had an unusually early start to the fertilizer application season. In stark contrast, this year, we're experiencing an unusually late start to the season. However, it is our same set of core business strengths of manufacturing flexibility, nimble transportation and logistics infrastructure and significant end-market storage assets, all operated by the best team in the business that have enabled us to post outstanding results under vastly different market conditions.","The first quarter of 2012 was characterized by an abnormally early start to field preparation work throughout North America, most notably in the upper Midwest United States, which is an area of significant demand for preplant ammonia application. The year-ago quarter also was characterized by relatively-low urea imports, which set the stage for very strong urea prices throughout the spring season. This year, we saw a more normal weather result and a late -- later start to ammonia application.","During the first quarter of 2013, we also had a higher volume of urea imports, which along with the late start to the application season, has weighed on urea prices in North America.","Despite these diverging market trends, the effective management of our business enabled us to generate 10% growth in net earnings and due to our share repurchases, 17% growth in earnings per share.","As you know, nitrogen is a nutrient that must be applied on corn every year to generate the yields that allow farmers to maximize their profitability. In the first quarter, we saw clear evidence of strong demand for nitrogen in the volume of UAN that we ship to our customers, and we have a very strong UAN order book, which indicates our customers' desire to have product available as the season gets up to speed.","During the quarter, we sold 3.5 million tons of our products, a decrease of 6% compared to the exceptional first quarter of 2012, but also 6% higher than the same period in 2011 when we experienced comparable weather conditions.","In the nitrogen segment, we had a year-over-year increase in the average price for each of our major products, except urea, and strong product volumes considering the later start to application compared to last year.","Ammonia is the product that experienced the greatest year-over-year change in volume. In 2012, we sold 672,000 tons of ammonia, an unprecedented amount that reflected the exceptional weather conditions that allowed farmers to get into their fields to start application in early March. This year, we sold 334,000 tons of ammonia, a more typical amount. The cool wet weather prevented farmers from starting ammonia application in the Corn Belt during the quarter, but we did experience good movement in the Southwestern states.","Pricing for ammonia was quite strong throughout the quarter. The average price per ton was about even with the first quarter of 2012 reported average price and increased about 6% compared to the adjusted average price. This year-over-year increase in the strength of ammonia prices in the Corn Belt demonstrate the market's strong demand expectations for the spring application season.","Urea sales volume and average prices both declined from the first quarter of 2012. Our sales volume was very strong in 2012 given the early start to the application season compared to this year. And as I noted earlier, prices declined due to the delayed demand and the higher volume of imports that has come to the U.S. this year.","This season's price movements compared to the very strong price -- spot market prices last year remind us that this is a dynamic market, with sharp price movements in both positive and negative directions. To be a reliable supplier in this market, companies need to have the infrastructure to store their product during periods of market slowness, a distribution system to be able to move product to market quickly and the financial strength to weather periods of slow demand and relatively-modest prices. I emphasize the word relatively because as we know, even at the most recent published Gulf urea spot price of $330 per ton, CF Industries still earns very attractive margins.","UAN has been an area of robust demand and attractive prices for us this year. This led us to increase our production of UAN relative to urea in order to capture the enhanced earnings opportunity. Since UAN can be stored in downstream customer locations, we saw strong movement to dealers and distributors as they sought to build their inventories in preparation for a very robust spring application. To put this in perspective, our UAN volumes set a first quarter record and was the second highest we've delivered in any single quarter. We managed our UAN pricing and order book very well during this period of robust demand. As a result, we realized an average price of $329 per ton. With the importance of UAN to our company, this was a key component of the strong results we generated this quarter.","Our cost of natural gas increased slightly from the year prior levels. Although weather early in the quarter was relatively mild, this March proved to be among the coldest on record and natural gas prices experienced an associated rally. Our long-term view is that natural gas prices are sustainable in a range of roughly $3 to $5 per MMBtu and the production increases should limit any sustained price rally.","Our Phosphate business generated $28 million of gross margin on sales of $239 million. While export volume and prices decreased due to a slow international market, we experienced healthy volume and prices in the domestic market, giving prospects for a strong, albeit delayed, spring season.","As we noted in our earnings release and the press release we published April 22, we bought back 2.5 million shares during the quarter. And with purchases subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have bought back a total of 3.8 million shares for the year-to-date, representing approximately 6% of shares outstanding as of the end of 2012. These repurchases totaled $750 million for an average price of approximately $197 per share. We believe the repurchases represent exceptional value.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dennis for a few more comments on our financial performance.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. During the first quarter of 2013, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $407 million or $6.47 per diluted share. This compares to $368 million or $5.54 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. Our first quarter 2013 earnings per share included an unrealized gain on natural gas derivatives of $0.23, a loss on foreign currency derivatives of $0.12 and an after-tax net benefit from the recognition of net operating loss carryforwards from prior to our IPO of $0.33. First quarter of 2012 earnings per share included a mark-to-market loss on natural gas derivatives of $0.52.","Our Nitrogen business had a very good first quarter, which you can see on Slide 6. We delivered 3 million tons of nitrogen products and achieved a gross margin of $648 million compared to $662 million in 2012. The decrease in nitrogen gross margin versus the prior year reflects the more normal timing of shipments this year compared to the early movement last year.","Gross margin as a percent of sales increased from 52% to 59% due to the gain on natural gas derivatives in 2013 compared to the loss in 2012.","During the first quarter of 2013, we sold 334,000 tons of ammonia at an average realized price of $600 per ton compared to 672,000 tons in 2012 at an average reported price of $598 per ton or an average adjusted price of $567.","Ammonia sales volume for the first quarter of 2012 benefited from exceptionally early start to the application season, while volume in the first quarter of 2013 reflected the impact of more normal weather conditions. Ammonia prices increased due to anticipated strong demand for the spring planting season and tight supplies throughout most of the quarter.","Granular urea sales volume was 643,000 tons in the first quarter of 2013 compared to 758,000 tons in the first quarter of 2012. The average price was $410 per ton in the 2013 period versus an average reported price of $461 or an average adjusted price of $436 in the prior year.","Sales volume decreased due to the later start to the application season compared to the unusually early start in 2012, while the average price decreased due to higher imports than the prior year period.","During the first quarter, we sold approximately 1.6 million tons of UAN compared to 1.4 million tons in the first quarter of 2012, an increase of 17%. Average UAN prices were $329 per ton, a 9% increase from the first quarter of 2012. Our sales volume was higher due to robust demand for movement of product into dealer storage in anticipation of a strong application season and our decision to increase UAN production relative to urea production due to the attractive margin opportunity. UAN prices increased due to the strong demand and our effective management of pricing structure and our order book.","Ammonium nitrate sales were 208,000 tons in the first quarter of 2013, a decrease from 247,000 tons in the first quarter of 2012. Average prices were $264 per ton in 2013, an increase from $259 in 2012.","With more normal winter weather in 2013 compared to the very warm weather in 2012, the average daily market price of natural gas increased to $3.49 per MMBtu for the first quarter. Our realized cost of natural gas was slightly higher, $3.57 per MMBtu reflecting the premiums we paid to cap our cost of natural gas for the use of call options. As of April 30, 2013, we had 90% of our projected natural gas needs capped through July.","As shown on Slide 7, our Phosphate segment achieved total revenue during the first quarter of $239 million, down 7% from the first quarter of 2012. Total sales volume for DAP and MAP was 495,000 tons, 4% lower than in the first quarter of 2012 with domestic volume up from 325,000 to 382,000 tons due to strong demand associated with expected spring planting.","Export volume was down from 191,000 tons to 113,000 tons due to our having more attractive options in the domestic market. Although our average price per ton for the products diverged, with MAP prices increasing while DAP prices decrease, it is worth noting that domestic prices for both products increased due to healthy U.S. demand. International prices, however, decreased due to lower demand than last year.","The Phosphate segment generated $28 million of gross margin, down from $50 million reported a year ago due to lower revenues and higher cost of production. As discussed in the release, during the first quarter, we recognized a net after-tax benefit of $20.6 million resulting from a closing agreement with the IRS related to net operating losses from periods prior to our IPO when the company was operated as a cooperative.","Our $750 million of share repurchases was funded through cash on hand. As we reported on April 22, we increased the size of our revolving credit facility from $500 million to $1 billion and extended its maturity by a year to 2018, beyond the time frame within which we expect to complete our capacity expansion projects. We filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement that enables us to access the capital markets quickly, if we should decide to take advantage of the attractive rates at which we could issue debt in the investment-grade credit market.","These actions demonstrate our financial capability to execute our strategic initiatives and we are, of course, pleased with the ratings upgrade we received recently from Moody's.","Finally, we expect to spend between $600 million and $800 million during 2013 on our capacity expansion projects. This range is approximately $400 million lower than the range we communicated previously due to the refinements and estimated timing of expenditures. These refinements have no impact on project schedules, which are progressing according to plan. Capital expenditures for existing facilities are expected to be approximately $450 million.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. With a team of employees who have exceptional focus on operational excellence, we're confident that we will be able to capitalize on the opportunity that this very attractive, albeit late starting, plant nutrient application season presents. The late season will require utilization of the strengths of our business: Production mix flexibility, transportation and logistic infrastructure, extensive end market storage assets, and global presence with export options. Our product mix flexibility is a key capability in dealing with the varied markets such as last year, when urea come in at a price premium due to the tightness of its market and this year when attractive prices have made increasing UAN production a valuable option. Incidentally, our flexibility to shift between urea and UAN will increase substantially when our Donaldsonville expansion is complete.","While farmers will make every effort to use ammonia prior to planting this spring, we expect they will reach a point where they will forgo preplant application, plant their crop, and come back later with ammonia and\/or UAN. We have been producing UAN at high rates in order to meet the demand and to realize the very attractive margins that come along with those sales. While urea prices have been under pressure due to the late-season start and the volume of imports, our transportation and logistics system has allowed us to move our urea into the Corn Belt, where we believe we will realize the best net pricing. And having significant end-market storage, in particular for ammonia, is of critical importance as is being demonstrated this spring. With a compressed time period available to farmers for applying ammonia, having in-market availability of product and the ability to load customer trucks quickly is vitally important.","The vast volume of spring ammonia application often occurs in a period as short as 10 days. We have organizational insight to global trends and the ability to market our products to export destinations when price opportunities are attractive. This enables us to identify and take advantage of sales opportunities around the world for all of the products in our production mix. We anticipate these opportunities will include selling significant volumes of phosphate into South America and India this year, as those markets are expected to have robust phosphate demand.","Our share repurchases to-date in 2013 bring the total cash we have used to purchase shares since 2011 to $2.25 billion for 17% of our outstanding shares at an average price of $168 per share. And we have authorization in place to purchase another $2.25 billion worth of our shares. During that same period, we have paid $182 million in dividends and spent nearly $800 million on capital expenditures. And last week, we completed our Medicine Hat interest acquisition for about $900 million.","In total, we have deployed approximately $4.1 billion of capital since mid-2011 to sustain the business, invest in future growth and return cash to shareholders. This has all taken place since our $4.6 billion acquisition of Terra in 2010, which was clearly a timely value creator for our shareholders. We are committed to continuing this record of disciplined cash deployment as illustrated by our capacity expansions and by our remaining share purchase authorization.","So in conclusion, I'm extremely pleased with where CF Industries is today, continuing to post very strong operating results and doing what we said we would do in executing strategic initiatives that we believe will create even more value for our shareholders.","With that, let's open the call to your questions. Rachel, please explain the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, in light of the late planting in North America, could you comment on the likely impact on the quarterly cadence of your earnings and perhaps discuss how late in the growing season growers can apply ammonia and UAN, and your anticipated mix effects there?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, in terms of the -- I mean, the quarterly cadence of our earnings is frankly not something that we spend a lot of time worrying about. We look at our season from early spring through the beginning of summer, and we move as much product as we can into the marketplace when it's demanded. And the split between Q1 and Q2 ends up being whatever it is. But having said that, we have a very good order book. We're very optimistic about the amount of product we're going to move in -- into the market and the economics associated with that. And Bert, I'll ask you to handle the second one.","Bert A. Frost","Regarding ammonia application and how late or how long that will go, we're seeing good movement throughout our system today and we have throughout the last week, and that's distributed around where we have our terminals on the pipelines and on the river, and we anticipate that to continue. The areas that were most affected by not applying ammonia last year were in the north, North Dakota, Minnesota and Canada, and that's the area where we believe significant ammonia needs to go down, and that area also has a little bit more of a window to put that product down. And so we anticipate that area to start this week. And if you look at North Dakota on the weather MAP, which we seem to follow every day, they've got an open window probably for the next week, with appropriate temperatures and lack of moisture. On ammonia, you can apply ammonia for preplant and have it cure as short as 3 days, as long as 7 days, and so let's take an average of 5. And so you need a window to apply and then wait for the product to cure and then plant the seed. But don't forget that the side-dress season could continue until the plant is up to 3-foot tall, let's take an average of 3 feet tall. And so I would expect that side-dress due to the late planting will continue into July. So we will see positive movement of ammonia, even though we recognize that some ammonia areas may move to UAN, ammonia will still be going through 'til early July.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Very good. That's helpful. As a second question, can you comment on the reasons behind the deferral of $400 million in your capital programs to the new range of $600 million to $800 million for 2013? Why was that reduced? And also why -- given the reduction, is there no impact on your expected timeline?","Stephen R. Wilson","Kevin, there's actually no deferral involved in this. When we put our estimates together early on in terms of these projects, we tend to err on the conservative side in terms of the timing, so that we're prepared to handle liquidity needs that could come up as we move forward in the projects and we begin to negotiate for individual pieces of equipment and individual pieces of work. We're going through contract negotiations with suppliers, and the resulting terms of those contracts then determine the cash outflow pattern. So what we have is much more visibility into the actual outflows that will occur. So it is simply a refinement in our estimate and it is -- and obviously, it's good working capital management if we can manage it in this fashion.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Steve, just to clarify, is the total expected cost of the project any lower at this juncture?","Stephen R. Wilson","It is not. We're comfortable with our estimate, and things are going along in a way that has, at least, worked in the direction of increasing our confidence level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Cornell of Barclays.","Kimberly Teller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This is Kimberly Teller sitting in for Matthew. I just wanted to know, has your willingness to hedge additional natural gas over the rest of the year changed at all?","Stephen R. Wilson","We've announced that we're -- we have in place call options that cap our cost of natural gas for 90% of our expected usage between now and the end of July. And we visit this opportunity on a regular basis. Should we find the right opportunity to do more of it, we certainly will, but we've made no decisions at this point.","Kimberly Teller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And then just one other question. Could you speak a little bit about whether or not you see continued high Chinese export levels for urea being  a concern and just because they've had a weak demand season, what the potential is for that over the course of the year?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, the early signals are that we might experience urea import levels similar to those that we experienced last year. We don't really know until the window opens up, but we -- in terms of our own planning, we're assuming another strong year of Chinese urea exports.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Steve, question on your forward order book, it's up considerably year-over-year, $700 million. I think you made some comments that it's primarily UAN. So what drove the increase year-over-year? Just was it more demand from growers for UAN, or was it just your decision that the economics of UAN were more attractive this year than they were last year?","Stephen R. Wilson","Don, I'll turn it over to Bert in a second, but remember that we had very, very strong movement in March of last year, and so last year may have been artificially low as a basis of comparison. But Bert, do you want to elaborate?","Bert A. Frost","Regarding UAN, we identified early in Q1 some trends that we thought were positive for market for UAN. And we executed several decisions regarding sales, sales prices, production increases in UAN -- that actually took place late in -- probably Q4 2012. And so we believe that we identified correctly where the market would be and executed that and then worked with our customers to take sales into Q2, and we're now executing against that.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And Bert, just to follow up, with urea pricing down where it is, it's -- basically UAN is trading at a 30% premium to urea on a nitrogen equivalent base. Are you seeing any sort of latent interest on the part of growers to use urea, or is it just that the convenience of UAN is -- makes it more attractive despite the price?","Bert A. Frost","It's interesting. We talk about these issues. It seems every year, this comes up on what product customers or farmers will switch to, and do they switch and will they switch. And last year, even at urea at $700, those who use urea -- traditionally use urea -- stayed with urea, even though UAN was trading probably close to $320. And this year, we're seeing UAN priced, as you've mentioned at probably a 30% premium and we're experiencing I would say robust demand for UAN, but we also expect urea to pick up as customers look to maximize their N applications as they progress in their planting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Steve, can we talk a little bit about sort of what can happen to pricing if we look out 2016, 2017, 2018, whatever the period is when all the U.S. plants come online? And if we assume the U.S. has to become a net exporter, do you think you can use the Donaldsonville facility sort of as a valve to keep the U.S. market balanced and the premium-priced market the way that it is today? Or how do you expect those dynamics to play out?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, first of all, Vince, and I think it's extremely unlikely that the U.S. will be in a net export position by 2016 or '17. I would be quite surprised if that were to happen. But I will just go on to say that one of the principal reasons we're investing $2.1 billion at our Donaldsonville location is that it's on deep water. And so we will be in a position to take advantage of the best available economics, whether the economics are offshore or onshore. And I think we're frankly in a unique position with that big footprint that we have in Louisiana. We have lots of flexibility domestically in terms of the way we move the product, and then we have the ability to load oceangoing ships and move it to the -- whatever region of the world can give us the best net-back. So I think we're ideally suited for handling whatever circumstance evolves.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just secondly, could you talk about what would cause you to decide to issue debt? I mean, obviously, you talked about the rates being attractive, so -- or maybe the question is why haven't you done it yet? What would cause you to do it or not do it?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, Vince, and I'll just go back to strategy real quickly. We've announced $3.8 billion capacity expansion projects. We just completed Medicine Hat. And we've got a $3 billion share repurchase program, of which we've already done $750 million. So we're very committed to making sure that all of those things happen, as Steve said in his speech, before the end of 2016. You will have seen also we've filed a shelf registration statement. We increased the size of our revolver. So obviously, it wouldn't be surprising, given where rates are today, that we would go out into the market looking for debt at some point. When we have something to report on that that's definitive, we'll let you know. But I think we've got, as I look at our strategic plans, I think we've got a very capital efficient financing plan to deliver on those things over the next 3 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just circling back on UAN, is it a foregone conclusion that Q2 is going to be a record Q2 for CF for UAN, and maybe ask the same question for Q3 as well, please?","Stephen R. Wilson","I mean, Joel, I will say I have an idea that it will be a very good quarter. Whether it will be a record quarter for UAN, it's way too early to project that.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. I also want to ask you, with the urea prices coming down, hopefully getting to floor prices here, do you have a sense that the floor price will be closer to the Eastern European high-cost production cost or some of the Chinese costs?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Joe, I don't think they're all that different. Certainly, our recent experience over the last couple of years has been that when prices get down into this range that the capacity -- the production that reacts is the production in Eastern Europe, and we'll see what unfolds.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","And finally, looking at phosphates, do you expect a little bit of demand destruction at all this spring because it keeps pushing out on phosphates? And do you expect summer fill prices to be lower, or do you think price have come off enough?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Yes, regarding demand destruction, what we are seeing, and this is anecdotally, that farmers are eager to get in the fields and may forgo a P&K application in certain areas, thinking they can probably pick that up in the fall. How big that is or how small that is, we'll have to wait and see. Regarding summer fill, we have an interesting scenario taking place in the world of phosphates with India delaying their purchasing, and we expect that they have 3 million to 4 million tons to purchase, but having a phosphoric acid negotiation and a rate that's closed, that puts a higher floor on phosphate DAP imports into India. And so you could see an increase in phosphate demand in India for DAP, as well as the South Americans delaying their purchases of -- right now it looks like all their products and at the same time that will come into the market as our summer fill. So you could paint a scenario that the markets will improve over the next several months as all of these demand points come at the same time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When I look at your share repurchase history, you've historically tended to buy back shares below $180 a share. And now you're buying them into the 2s and you're buying them at -- in substantial quantities. And so I was wondering whether there was a philosophic change on your part, in terms of the way that you relate to share repurchase that is why the prices that you're willing to buy stock back now are so much higher than in the past? And what was the highest price that you paid for your shares over the last 2 months?","Stephen R. Wilson","Jeff, our philosophy on share repurchases has not changed. We buy our shares back when we believe they represent good value. I think I made that comment earlier that we believe the shares we have repurchased represent good value for our shareholders. And the average price at which we bought -- have bought shares back recently, the $750 million was at $168 on average, and we noted an average of $197 roughly for the -- for what we did in Q1.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, are there any changes in your tax rate going forward given some of the issues that arose this quarter? And on your income statement, there was, I think, a $54 million expense, nonoperating expense. I was wondering what that was?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, the $54 million nonoperating expense -- if you go back to the discussion in the press release and also in our script, we had a settlement with the IRS with respect to net operating loss carryforwards that were generated during the time when the company was a cooperative before our IPO. That allowed us to reduce our income tax provision in the quarter by $75.8 million to $107 million as you see there, which -- what it is on the income statement. In addition to that, we had an agreement with the pre-IPO owners, that is other cooperatives and the pre-IPO owners of the company, that we would share the benefit of that with them, and the sharing of that benefit amounted to $55.2 million. That $55.2 million is the major component of that other operating expense net.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is there any change in your tax rate going forward or this was all 1 quarter?","Dennis P. Kelleher","No, this is a one-time thing. If you go -- if you were to subtract out, okay, the effects of both the agreement with the owners and also the settlement with the IRS, the tax rate wouldn't be 20% as you see here, it would be 31%, okay? And so we still see our tax -- our effective tax rate going forward more or less in the range that we've seen it in the past.","Operator","Your next question is from Chris Parkinson of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Given that Chinese exports in the U.S. are a relatively well-known theme, can you comment on your expectations for pricing trends for both UAN and ammonia given the international supply dynamic, and in particular, just with respect to producers in North America, Trinidad and Eastern Europe?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","You were a little bit quiet on your question. If I understood your question to be \"With Chinese exports being what they are or what we expect them to be, what do we expect for pricing for our products\", is that correct?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, for UAN and ammonia out of the other respective producers?","Bert A. Frost","Okay. Well, when you figure out China, let me know. We did not expect the volume of exports to come out of China last year, and it ended up being substantial. And in Q1, they continued that trend, and we expect that for the full year 2013 that they will mirror last year, more or less. Again, we don't have a plus or minus factor there. We know that there are substantial quantities already positioned in the ports for the July 1 export date, and that's kind of hanging over the market. That and the combination of Iranian exports to India, that seemed to take or dominate those tenders, that then has pushed the Arab Gulf tons and other maybe Egyptian tons to the United States and to other markets, in excess. And so we have this 2 million-ton hangover, overhanging over the market right now for this current period, and some of that will bleed into the third and fourth quarter. And so what we're seeing is what's being played out --  an irrational market of urea being priced down to where the Chinese may not be encouraged to export. So the impact on UAN, we've seen a divergence. UAN has been demanded and has been priced, we think, appropriately. We've captured that. The market is eager to utilize the UAN and as well as ammonia is at probably a higher rate. Going into the third and fourth quarter, we will have a natural. And just like historically, we have had the reset we call the fill period in the United States. And those prices for UAN and ammonia will moderate to a level where farmers are encouraged to contract with their retailers and we will then sell to the retailer. And so I don't think we're going to have a substantial drop outside of a historical norm for that period, and then we should trend well into the third and fourth quarter.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great color. And just a quick follow-up on the CapEx reduction for Donaldsonville and Port Neal. Is the remaining $600 million to $800 million still mainly equipment prepayments? Basically, is there any other color you could offer there?","Dennis P. Kelleher","I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your question, Chris.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sorry, regarding the $600 million to $800 million in remaining CapEx, is that primarily equipment prepayments?","Stephen R. Wilson","Tony, do you want to comment on that?","W. Anthony Will","It's a combination of -- for this year for $600 million to $800 million is combination of equipment prepayment, there's engineering and procurement services costs in there, and then our expectation is that we're going to begin civil work and construction in -- sometime in the summer. So there's earthmoving and construction activity in there as well.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Steve, you've obviously demonstrated what the flexibility of your system can do in terms of responding to changes in demand. Do you think it's going to be harder for you to exit the season with nitrogen inventories where you want them? Obviously, flexibility helps you get stuff where it needs to be, but is it going to be tougher to manage inventories as you exit this year?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, my general comment on that, Mark, is that every year really has the same objective. There never seems to be such a thing as a normal or average season. Some products are in higher demand than others. And at the end of the year, we inherit whatever is there. We're seeing very strong UAN movement. Bert talked about an ammonia season going into July. A lot of nitrogen is going to end up going to the ground. And so we're -- should we move as much as we think we'll move, I think our overall inventory position will be just fine. We may have a little more of one product than another, but that's really the case every year.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. But no overall -- no greater challenge to the overall nitrogen is what you're saying, right?","Stephen R. Wilson","Right.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And just one more question. If I tie together a couple of your comments, the U.S. won't be a net exporter by 2016, your comments about China perhaps selling quite a bit again next year, do you think there's a trend from -- looking at your own outlook, do you see a trend in U.S. imports over the next couple of years? Or is it actually getting more unpredictable?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Well, predictable or unpredictable, what has happened this year is some traders and producers were long. The U.S. is a liquid market, NOLA specifically, and we saw product from Oman and other places that may not normally come on a ratable basis, begin coming on that -- on a monthly level, as well as some other locations like Indonesia. And so we became the fallback position or the backstop at some points for the market, the world market. Will that continue? I think that nobody likes to lose money. And so if you're a trader or a producer, like this floating China vessel that's stopped in Panama for a couple of months' vacation and then came to NOLA to discharge, those people lost a lot of money, and that's what people in those positions need to decide what they want to do and how they want to market their products on a consistent basis. We will have a demand for urea over the long term. We'll bring it in from Canada, as well as from other producing locations. But at some point, it will get to a competitive market where we in the U.S. will have a substantial increase in production and we will compete with those producers at the various distribution points. And I think that will moderate itself -- the market will moderate itself.","Operator","Your next question is from P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So you finished the quarter of your $3 billion buyback that runs through 2016. It seems like an accelerated buyback. So are you being opportunistic? Or do you see this delayed CapEx and so maybe you pulled your buyback forward? Can you just comment on that?","Stephen R. Wilson","Sure, P.J. I think we've been very consistent in our comments about capital deployment. All of our initiatives are important to us. We are committed to doing all of them, and we will execute them month by month, quarter-by-quarter as it seems appropriate. Nothing has changed in our attitude towards either the CapEx or the share repurchases.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And a question for Tony. Tony, there was a recent tragic blow-up in West Texas. Do you think that changes the debate between the communities where these new plants are being built? And do you expect any delay as a result? And are you seeing sort of more inquiries on your project from communities?","W. Anthony Will","P.J., obviously, our thoughts are with the -- those affected in West Texas, and it was a horrible tragedy. The hallmark, I think, of CF Industries and the rest of the producers in the industry is a focus on safety and working with the communities to put in place appropriate first responder, response plans and to run drills and exercises and to make sure that all parties know how to respond. But our first and primary focus is on maintenance and safety and ensuring that we don't have issues in the first place. And I think the communities in which we operate appreciate the -- what we bring to those communities and respect our operating practices and culture in that regard. And so while clearly this is a topic that is getting a lot of media attention, rightfully so, we believe the way in which we conduct ourselves and operate our facilities is appropriate. So at this time, we don't see a significant impact in terms of our ability to move forward on these projects.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Picken of Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Kind of a follow-up to what P.J.'s question was. I mean, how do you see the tragedy in West Texas potentially impacting the EPA approvals maybe for some of the other greenfield projects that are being discussed, or do you think that will have any bearing? And I guess as an addendum to that, what does that mean for the future of ammonium nitrate sales here in the United States?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Mike, we -- we obviously -- I certainly echo the comments that Tony made about this event. And our industry is very, very highly regulated today, particularly our end of the industry. We work closely with DHS, OSHA, the EPA, local and state authorities. We certainly will wait for the full report coming back about what happened. There are initiatives, frankly, that have been underway for quite a while related to safe storage and handling of ammonium nitrate. And in our observation, safety is #1 every place, every day. And I think we do safety well, but every -- any part of our business can be improved, even that part of our business. I can't predict what's going to happen among regulators in Washington. We have constructive relationships with those entities, both as a company and as an industry through the Fertilizer Institute and we'll be absolutely cooperative and helpful in any way we can in making sure that everybody in the chain of making, distributing and using all of our products is following the best safety practices available.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Great. And then my third question is, if you could just quickly walk through now that you've completed the purchase of the remaining 34% of CFL's production, what that might mean for your ammonia price realization sort of going forward and kind of you had to sell -- or some of those contracts were on a cost-plus basis. But if you could kind of walk through how we should think about your average ammonia prices kind of going forward, that'd be helpful.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Mike, I think the best way to think about this acquisition of the 1\/3 remaining capacity at Medicine Hat is to think about how we did Terra. We put all of the production coming from all of the entities into our portfolio. And we go through a process of rationally selling all of it into the marketplace in an attempt to maximize our overall margin. This -- it's important to remember, of course, that this piece of production is already in the marketplace. It's already been going someplace, so it's not being added -- not being added to the market. We will add it to what our offering is and we'll -- Bert and his team will go out every day and market that in the same effective way that he markets everything else. Mike, I guess, I'll just add one thing to that comment, and that is, certainly, one of the things that will happen in a quarter or 2 is that there'll be much better visibility into what our actual pricing is because we will be past the point of having to go through this adjustment process. And so while the main driver of this transaction, of course, was having the economics associated with this production, simplifying the accounting reporting of it will be a benefit to management and a benefit to investors and analysts.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tim Tiberio  of Miller Tabak.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","I have a question more on the demand side. I know a few months ago people were more concerned that the drought conditions may trap more nutrients in the soil and that could diminish spring demand. But it seems like in this current environment where spring planting has been delayed, there's been significant moisture replenishment. We have heard anecdotal concerns that farmers are more concerned about nitrogen leaching in this environment. Putting that into context, is this an environment where even though demand has been delayed, that we could actually be in a situation that in some regions farmers may actually have to increase applications to kind of replace some of the fall ammonia that potentially could have been lost during this delayed spring?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Regarding leaching and the movement of nitrogen during the period of -- from the period of fall application to spring planting, that has also more anecdotal than factual and we're not exactly sure, and I can't give you a percentage. What we will see is what we believe is a maximization of nitrogen as they plant the corn and as they look to have the yield uplift and the right feeding of the crop, you will see various applications. If a spring preplant of ammonia was not able to be put on, you'll probably see 2 to 3 applications of UAN, especially the irrigated areas and possibly a top-dress of urea in more of the northern areas. And so on total end demand, we're very positive that this year will be similar to others and maybe a slight increase to achieve a maximum yield with a shorter growing cycle.","Tim J. Tiberio - Miller Tabak + Co., LLC, Research Division","Great. And just one follow-up question on Trinidad. I believe one of your peers indicated that natural gas supply had kind of improved versus previous quarters. Are you seeing any improvement in that situation and how should we look at that going forward in 2013?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I think there's a lot of talk about how the supply should become more reliable. I'm not sure we've seen it yet, although the impact on us has not been all that significant. Over the last couple of years, it's been an aggravation, but I don't think it's been much of an economic penalty to us.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question on the Phosphate business and I'm just wondering maybe a bit more color on the higher production costs that were experienced in 1Q and the decline -- the higher per ton cost there, any clarity would be helpful?","W. Anthony Will","Well, Tim -- Adam, sorry, the biggest issue affecting our production cost was really the price of ammonia into DAP and MAP. Tampa ammonia was up significantly year-on-year and that drove the majority of the price increase, the cost increase.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe just finally, as you think about your -- I know we talked about your inventories, but thinking about the industry inventories exiting the spring, I mean, how do you foresee that impacting really your ability to execute on a normal summer fill program? And these excess inventories that have come into the country, I mean, how do you think that can delay any kind of summer fill demand as you move into the third quarter?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Summer fill is driven by a number of factors, 1 of those would be inventory, 2 would be timing. And generally, the retailers and the farmers want to work through their current purchases and then if the crop is at a state where they -- where it's really left to rain and sunshine, then focus on the next period. And so with the late planting, we would expect that fall fill will also be delayed for ammonia and UAN until those applications are over. And so inventory levels, again, this goes back to the -- you can't -- I don't want to comment too much on the industry, those numbers will come out. But CF, we think, will be appropriately positioned to begin the fill period and -- but that's the benefit of our system with the distribution assets we have in place, with the capability that we have to export products -- when we choose to participate in those markets, we will position ourselves to supply our customers in an appropriate level, at an appropriate price, when the time comes.","Operator","I'd now like to pass back to Dan Swenson for closing remarks.","Dan Swenson","We'd like to thank everyone who participated on the call today.

Sir, please proceed.","Dan Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, and with me are Steve Wilson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Market Development; and Tony Will, our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its third quarter 2012 results yesterday afternoon, as did Terra Nitrogen Company LP. On this call, we\u2019ll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website.

Consider all forward-looking statements in light of those and other risks and uncertainties. Do not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Steve Wilson, our Chairman and CEO.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. From the perspective of a crop nutrient manufacturer, especially a nitrogen producer, it would be difficult to imagine a better business setting and the way this year has progressed. An extended spring fertilizer application season, along with an exceptionally large number of corn acres planted in the U.S., led to very strong demand for fertilizers in the first half of the year.","Unfortunately for farmers, weather that was so conducive to field preparation and planting work turned harshly hot and dry, withering crops and sending grain prices soaring. Thankfully, many farmers had crop insurance which protected them financially and should ensure their liquidity going into next year's planting season.","Dry weather, along with early crop maturity, has led to an early harvest, with 95% of the corn crop harvested as of November 4, about 4 weeks ahead of average. As a result, fields are clear and ready for nutrient applications much earlier than normal, positioning the North American fertilizer industry for potential or a potential extended fall application season.","With so much of the harvest complete, recent rains across the midwest and northern plains have been well-timed to alleviate soil moisture concerns in most areas and created field conditions conducive to fall ammonia application. These conditions, along with the expectation that farmers will plant 97 million acres of corn in 2013, led to exceptionally strong dealer demand for fertilizer for summer fill and fall application and set the stage for us to deliver another strong quarter of financial results.","As detailed in our press release published yesterday afternoon, we realized record third quarter EBITDA, net earnings and earnings per share. Our EBITDA of $729 million increased 14% over the prior-year period. Our net earnings of $403 million increased 22%, and our diluted earnings per share of $6.35 was 34% higher than the prior year period.","Low water levels on the river transportation system presented logistical challenges during the quarter, but our team did a great job of overcoming them. In so doing, we've proved once again the value of our unmatched production and distribution network.","To cite just one example of this capability, a few years ago, we made investments in our Palmyra, Missouri Ammonia Terminal to expand its capacity to load barges with ammonia it receives via pipeline from Donaldsonville. When the low water level on the Mississippi caused a shipping bottleneck, we've diverted 2 of our empty southbound ammonia tows that had been headed to Donaldsonville. Instead, we reloaded them at Palmyra, which is north of the choke point, and then sent those barges up the Illinois River, effectively using our access to the NuStar Ammonia Pipeline to deliver product around the Mississippi River choke points.","When Hurricane Isaac came through Louisiana in August, we did shut down production at Donaldsonville as a precautionary measure. We incurred no significant damage and had the complex back on stream to begin production within 3 days. We experienced strong ammonia volume and prices during the third quarter. Volume was higher than last year's third quarter as farmers were busy applying ammonia to winter wheat across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, and as dealers and distributors who have their own storage sought to secure product inventory in anticipation of the strong application season they are currently seeing across the Corn Belt.","Along with the strong demand, tight global ammonia supplies due to ongoing gas curtailments in Trinidad and production outages in the Middle East and Russia caused ammonia prices to increase significantly compared to a year ago. Expectations of robust farm-level nitrogen demand also prompted strong buying interest when we launched our UAN summer fill program back in June, resulting in an increase in UAN shipments during the third quarter of 2012 versus the prior year.","However, UAN imports during July and August were 28% higher than last year, which constrained prices. Urea imports during July and August were up about 14% from a year ago, and India's year-to-date purchases as of the end of September were approximately 9% below last year. Exports from China were higher than anticipated, and the year-to-date expert volume through September was 2.6 million tons versus 1.9 million tons in 2011. These factors resulted in lower market prices than a year ago, as you can see in the industry price graphs on Slide 6. However, the pattern of our company's order flow led to an 11% increase in realized prices.","Of course, we continue to realize benefits from the low cost of natural gas in North America. Gas prices moved up during the quarter but are still lower than the year ago, a benefit that contributed to our strong Nitrogen segment gross margin.","Our Phosphate business continued to perform well as our sales volume was up year-over-year and sequentially due to domestic sales which increased as dealers and distributors geared up for a strong fall application season. Export sales declined as shipments to Central and South America slowed during the quarter. Our operating costs were stable during the quarter, and the segment generated gross margin in line with this performance earlier in the year.","This quarter, once again, was characterized by excellent execution. The effectiveness of our employees in serving customers enabled us to turn these favorable conditions into exceptional financial results for our shareholders. We ran our combined ammonia operations at 99% of capacity and our phosphate operations at 98% of capacity.","We noted in the release that our Donaldsonville complex achieved 6 million safe work hours in the third quarter. On October 24, the Donaldsonville team surpassed the 10-year mark without a lost time accident. This is a complex that includes 5 ammonia plants, 4 urea plants, 3 nitric acid plants and 2 UAN plants, plus all of the associated handling, storage, transportation and support services. It's the largest nitrogen complex in North America and about to become larger.","I'd like to commend Lou Frey, our Vice President and General Manager at Donaldsonville, and every member of his team who has worked at the complex during the last decade. This is a remarkable safety achievement. Principal beneficiaries of safe operations are, of course, the employees themselves. The company's management and Board of Directors are proud to recognize this milestone.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Dennis for some details on our financial results.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone.","During the third quarter of 2012, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $403 million, or $6.35 per diluted share. This compares to $331 million, or $4.73 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2011.","Our third quarter 2012 earnings included a non-cash mark-to-market gain and natural gas derivatives of approximately $40 million and an $11-million gain related to a change in employee post-retirement benefits. The net impact of these 2 items was an increase of $0.50 in after-tax earnings per share.","Our Nitrogen business performed exceptionally well during the second quarter. We delivered 3 million tons of nitrogen products and achieved a gross margin of 58%, which you can see on Slide 6. The increase in segment gross margin reflects realized natural gas costs of $3.34 per MMBtu during the third quarter of 2012 as compared to $4.45 a year ago. It also reflects the non-cash mark-to-market gain of $40 million on natural gas derivative contracts in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to a loss of $14 million in the prior year period.  At the end of the quarter, we had hedged positions for approximately 60% of our expected natural gas purchases for the final quarter of 2012.","During the third quarter of 2012, we sold 416,000 tons of ammonia at an average price of $622 per ton. Ammonia volumes for the third quarter of 2012 was 3% higher than a year ago, primarily due to strong ammonia application on winter wheat, as well as customers' purchases of inventory in anticipation of a strong fall application for corn. Our average price for ammonia was 13% higher than in the third quarter of last year due to tight industry-wide inventory and strong demand.","Third quarter granular urea volume decreased by 20% year-over-year to 559,000 tons. This decrease reflects the facts that the third quarter of 2011 had higher beginning inventory, higher production volume and a higher level of export sales compared to the third quarter of 2012. Our average price of $470 per ton was 11% higher than in the third quarter of 2011 due to the pattern of the company's order flow.","During the third quarter of 2012, we sold 1.6 million tons of UAN, an average increase of about 3% from the third quarter of 2011. Average UAN price realizations were $296 per ton, a decrease of 7% due to a higher level of UAN imports during the third quarter of 2012 as compared to 2011.","As shown on Slide 7, our Phosphate segment achieved total revenue during the quarter of $264 million, down about 8% from third quarter of 2011. Total sales volume was 517,000 tons, 2% percent higher than in the third quarter of 2011.","Domestic sales volume increased 36% due to U.S. dealers and distributors replenishing inventory, while export sales volumes decreased by 35%, primarily due to lower sales to Central and South America. Average phosphate selling prices declined for both DAP and MAP due to lower overall global demand. The segment generated a 24% gross margin, down from 30% a year ago due to lower average selling prices.","These quarterly results contributed to record-setting year-to-date earnings for CF Industries.","For the 9 months ended September 30, 2012, the company set records across a number of financial metrics, including revenues, EBITDA, earnings and earnings per share. Total year-to-date revenues were $4.6 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the prior year period. Total EBITDA for the 9-month period increased 17% to a record $2.5 billion, while gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to 53% from 46%, driven by both higher selling prices and lower natural gas costs. These items contributed to a 25% increase in net earnings to common stockholders to a record $1.4 billion and, along with our lower share count, increased earnings per diluted share by 38% to $21.19.","Now let me turn it back to Steve.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. I anticipate that most of you are anxious to discuss our recent capacity expansion announcement. But first, I'd like to address our near-term outlook.","The fundamentals of our business are very attractive for the remainder of this year and going into 2013. With an anticipated 97 million acres of corn to be planted, crop nutrients, especially nitrogen, should be in very high demand. We currently have an attractive order book for nitrogen. A very strong ammonia movement began last week, and we anticipate great fall movement if the weather continues to cooperate.","The ammonia market generally is very tight going into next year, and we will be focused on effectively meeting the customer commitments we have in place. We are comfortable with our order book for UAN and anticipate that demand will continue to be strong into the spring.","Conditions in the urea market are expected to remain stable as we progress through the fourth quarter. We anticipate that continuing global demand, India purchases to meet its urea needs for the year, the end of a low tariff Chinese export season and production impacts from gas curtailments in other producing regions will be beneficial to the urea market in the coming months. We will have product available, and we'll be prepared to meet demand as it develops.","In the phosphate market, we will move through the normal low season conditions in November and December and watch out as market develops. We do anticipate good phosphate demand in 2013 as both domestic and international crop-planting intentions are very high, requiring significant crop nutrient application. We believe the cost advantages created by the low cost of North American natural gas should enable us to continue to earn very attractive margins as we move forward.","To provide perspective on the earnings power of our business, consider that the average cash margin for a nitrogen producer in the Gulf region, with urea at $400 per ton and natural gas at $3.50 per MMBtu, is over 65%. This speaks to the strength of the earnings profile of our Nitrogen business.","Now I'd like to conclude by providing you with some perspective on the capacity expansion projects we announced last week.  We are very excited to be proceeding with the major projects at Donaldsonville and Port Neal. They are indications of the strength of our company and our belief in the sustainability of the fundamentals of the Nitrogen business in North America. We believe that we are the best-positioned player in the industry today and that these projects will solidify that position for many years to come.","As you know, our thinking has progressed from possible debottlenecks and upgrades at various facilities to the 2 much larger scale projects we have decided to build. The evolution resulted from very detailed analysis of incremental opportunities throughout our nitrogen production network. At the same time, we were exploring those specific incremental opportunities in each of our complexes. We were completing FEED study work we had commissioned for the larger integrated approach at our brownfield sites. Following completion of the FEED work, we concluded that the 2 integrated ammonia and upgrade projects will provide attractive economics with less risk than the incremental approach. And we continue to retain the ability to do the debottlenecks of individual discrete projects at later dates in a sequential fashion that would minimize the associated execution risk.","As we noted in our release, we believe that we will be able to bring our new production online before most, if not all, of our competitor's projects. This is based upon our experience and the advanced status of design, site layout, infrastructure and our contracts with UDA. We expect to file our permit applications in Louisiana this month, and those in Iowa will follow close behind.","We believe that these projects will provide very attractive returns for our stockholders and that they will yield the best return\/risk relationships among available investment options. To put these projects in perspective, we estimate that even at an average urea price substantially below current levels and an average natural gas cost substantially above current levels, these projects will provide internal rates of return significantly above our cost of capital.","You may ask whether this announcement impacts the share repurchase program we approved in August. We believe that our financial profile and cash flow outlook are supportive of completing both that program and these projects in the time frames we have indicated.","We are proud to be the leading producer of nitrogen fertilizers in North America and look forward to generating even more value for our owners through these major initiatives. With that, Darcella, would you please open the lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I just wanted to ask a little bit about the new projects and maybe to follow-up on your comment, Steve, about the returns profile and your cost of capital. When we modeled out the 2 plants and did sort of a similar idea with you of higher gas prices assuming the strip during that time period and lower product prices sort of assuming a marginal cost of production at the high end of the cost curve, around $9 for gas, we were coming up with about 10% return profile for both plants. Would you agree with that?","Stephen R. Wilson","Vincent, I appreciate that you tried to replicate our analysis, but we'd like to keep the details of our analysis to ourselves for competitive reasons.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And second question would then be, if we were to fast forward, and assuming we're on the second quarter call in 2015 and the Donaldsonville expansion is up and running, if we also assumed that the current MLP market remains as it exists today, with a pretty big valuation discrepancy between CF to C corp and Terra Nitrogen Holdings, the MLP where you're the general partner and the largest unitholder, would you consider beginning to drop down these new projects, as the MLP market would allow, into that Terra Nitrogen vehicle?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, let me provide a little bit of perspective on that, and I will start by certainly acknowledging that we run an MLP today. As a general partner, we own a little more than 75% of the limited partner units. We also own 2\/3 of the Medicine Hat complex, which operates as a cooperative. So we have experience running entities in addition to our C corp mothership, if you will. So now, if I zoom out a little bit and I look at our total company profile, we're running 13 ammonia plants at 7 sites in North America. It's a complex network. And if we go back to the Terra acquisition, the synergy opportunity of running that as a single unit was very substantial, and we worked very hard to optimize our production, storage, distribution and transportation network. We think we've done a really great job in doing that. So if I think about the prospect of, for example, imposing into that network legal structures at individual facilities, even within individual facilities, it adds a degree of complexity and, frankly, adds some operating complications that would make it much more difficult for us to optimize this great network that we have. Our focus is on maximizing our ability to optimize the whole network and generate the most economic value we can find in the whole enterprise. We really would not welcome complications related to transfer pricing. And then I'll just add one more thought about that, and that is that it would create 2 major classes of holders of our securities. MLPs are generally held by retail investors. And as you know, CF Industries is held largely by institutions. So having to manage the differing expectations of those 2 investor bases again would add complication to a system that, frankly, works really well as it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Steve, a couple more questions on your expansions. For some time, you've been somewhat cautious on your ability to get carbon permitting for new facilities or major debottlenecks. So just wondering what's changed there, whether you made a prediction on today's election, but why you think you can get the permits that you need. And what have you done, if anything, to secure a source of long-term natural gas for these expansions from a pricing standpoint?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. I'll respond to your second question and then ask Tony Will to response to the first one. We have operated in the North American natural gas market our entire history. And one of the main reasons driving this decision, perhaps the main reason driving this decision, is the availability of low-cost natural gas and the sustainability of that supply in the U.S. We are comfortable operating in the spot market going forward, with occasional excursions like we did this year to fix gas. If someone were to come along and offer us the deal of a lifetime, of course we'd sign up for it. But we don't see any deals like that available to us. But we remain open to it. And Tony, would you comment on the permitting issue?","W. Anthony Will","Sure. We, today, obviously operate across all of our facilities with air and water permits and have a pretty constructive relationship with the regulators. We've been working with them very closely over the past year or so, doing extensive modeling. And the plants that we are building are state-of-the-art, a term of art is BACT, or best-available control technology in an environmental permitting world. And these plants are certainly best-available control technology plants. So their the lowest emissions, most efficient plants that can be built. And so we feel comfortable based on what it is that we're designing and building and our past relationship with regulators and existing conversations that we can get the permitting done.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, you alluded to some logistics challenges related to low water levels on the Mississippi. And in the release, you discussed sending more product by truck and rail. Did that have an appreciable impact on your financials in the quarter? And if so, what was the aggregate amount of that?","Stephen R. Wilson","Good morning, Kevin. I would characterize it as being negligible and perhaps difficult to extract from our overall financials. It really didn't move the needle.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And would that be true for the Hurricane Isaac outage of 3 days at Donaldsonville as well?","Stephen R. Wilson","Correct.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Very good. And then second question, if I may, on natural gas. In December of 2011, you chose to layer in some fairly significant hedges for the forward year. Perhaps you could comment on your current disposition with regard to the gas market and whether or not you have any hedges currently in place for 2013?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. I'll ask Dennis to respond to that.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, Kevin, good morning. With -- like we've said in the text of the speech, we've got 60% of the gas that we're going to buy in the fourth quarter of this year hedged, pursuant to the hedge we've put in place back at the back end of last year. And then as we look into 2013, we don't really have very much hedged at all other than stuff that we have for -- that we may have sold on the Forward Pricing Program. But we haven't taken on any sort of big-blanket hedges like we did at the end of -- in 2011.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Should we assume that overseas growth opportunities are off the table for now? Or do you still see yourself as having the financial flexibility to pursue additional opportunities offshore?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Mark, our focus for the next 3 years or so will be on executing the projects that we announced. We are always open, of course. And several years ago, before we had the shale gas revolution, we were intent upon expanding our footprint in the direction of being offshore. Today, if you look at the global cost curve, North America is the best-positioned, least risky place to be. If there's another part of the world that pops up as being essentially equally attractive, of course, we would be interested. But our focus right now is on Donaldsonville and Port Neal.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one more question. Would you expect to see unusually high urea imports this winter, given the current prices? And do you see the system having the ability to handle a big surge in imports?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay, I'll ask Bert Frost to address that. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Well, we anticipate urea imports to be consistent. We saw a higher level in August and September level of arrivals. And through the fourth quarter, we anticipate that those -- that the market will be sending urea to the United States, and we're seeing it today. Acres are going to be high at 97 million. You're seeing some wetness in the northern territory, which is ammonia area. And we've -- that area could move to urea pretty quickly. So we have a high degree of demand we will need to import, and that's why you're seeing us add our capacity additions focused on urea, because we think we are on a good place to capture that market in future years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Steve, you increased your CapEx forecast from your previous forecast. I mean, your CapEx. So what's your outlook on supply? And how many of these proposed nitrogen plants? I think there are 13 plants that have been proposed, how many of them you think will come online?","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. P.J., may I just make sure I understand your first comment. You're talking about we've increased the amount of money were committing to our expansion projects. Is that correct?","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That is correct.","Stephen R. Wilson","Not our CapEx for 2012? That's not what you were...","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No, no. That's right.","Stephen R. Wilson","Okay. Well, my only comment on that, P.J., is that the company -- that we all operate as committed to building these 2 projects. We are quite far down the road. We have already begun to spend money, and these projects will be built. I don't have any way of predicting whether any one or any group of projects may materialize. But clearly, our projects are right in the heart of the marketplace. We're building on strength. We're clearly not the marginal -- we're clearly not marginal projects. We are building projects that are needed in the marketplace. How many of the other ones get built, I don't know, it's up to other people. But I certainly expect some are going to fall off the list. I couldn't tell you which ones or when.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about a robust summer fill activity. And then some other companies are talking about that dealer inventories are quite low. So how do I reconcile those 2 statements? Who's doing the summer refill? Is it the dealers? Is it the farmers?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Well, our focus is on our greater wholesale and retail segments that we supply. And so we have constant communication with our customers that are represented by those segments. And so those segments have been purchasing to position the products for their customers, which are the farmers. And obviously, because of 2008 and the oscillations in the market, certain segments are reticent to take on tremendous or even marginal risk. And so we believe that those products that we have sold are working their way down through the value chain to the farmer. And have seen consistent demand from our customers to serve their customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I noticed that you didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter. Why was that?","Stephen R. Wilson","Jeff, as we have said, I think several times, we will be reporting on share repurchases as and when we do them. Our record on share repurchases going back to the first round in 2008, I think, has been quite successful. And we intend to continue to successfully repurchase our shares in a fashion that I think -- we hope will be recognized in retrospect as being effective.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I think the highest price at which you've repurchased shares has been at about $180 per share. So is it safe to think that if your stock price remains above, I don't know where it is now, say, $205 or $206, through the course of 2013, you wouldn't repurchase shares in 2013?","Stephen R. Wilson","Jeff, we will be reporting on our share repurchases after we do them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a question on the global nutrient markets overall. It seems that over the past few months, kind of been a dual track market where North American demand has been steady to good, while overseas demand, as you mentioned, in Central and South America in particular, has been somewhat lackluster. And I just -- any commentary you can offer on why that's persisting? It seems that though prices are good, global stocks are low. I don't know if it's high residual inventory, if there's more macro conversion? What's the outlook there for how that may converge or continue to show spread and demand?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Well you're seeing several different factors impacting the prize of urea, and it is a world product, the pricing. The United States is affected by different factors of supply and demand. And so you referenced Central and South American demand, and that demand has been consistent. There's been some issues with Brazil and their long lines at the ports due to earlier purchases and a high volume of NPNK products that have been directed to Brazil. And so that has pushed the arrival and some demand issues. But we expect their second-crop corn and cotton crop to be fully fertilized, which will require additional purchases. Argentina has had some spot issues also with that -- some due to climate. India has been -- has purchased -- as of now, we've mentioned in our script that they were 9% below through the quarter, but their recent tender brought them current with last year's demand. One of the impacts has been the addition of supply. And so China has increased -- or the amount coming out of China is higher than CF, as well as the industry expectations. And then you have additional supply out of Indonesia and other spot markets. And there is some uncertainty in Europe on demand. So you couple all that together, product has made its way to the United States and that has impacted the NOLA price, as well as the interior price. And so when you look at -- again, I would go back to the macro. When you look at what is going on in the market and where we are on pricing, we're in a stable market. Pricing has oscillated between $400 and I would say $440 over the last several months, and that's a very attractive place to be. Referencing Steve's comment with current gas and pricing at $400, that's a 65% margin, cash margin, for a urea producer. So when we look at the market, I think it's positive and has a positive trajectory for the future quarters.","Matthew Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. So it sounds as though -- really, the level of demand has been fairly constant and\/or steady, whereas region-to-region, product-to-product, if you had some fluctuations in the available supply, the impact where that demand actually manifests. In other words, whether they're buying from you or from [indiscernible] imports coming in?","Bert A. Frost","If I understand your question correctly, yes, additional supply has negatively impacted the market. The demand has been fairly consistent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","The CapEx for your expansions did go up from about $2 billion to about $3.8 billion. Obviously, you've added about 1 million tons of integrated ammonia with the new capacity. Maybe you could speak about what changed in your plan to decide to make the new capacity completely integrated for ammonia? And also, could you comment, if the new million tons of ammonia is roughly the $1.8 billion difference in incremental CapEx?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I think in my prepared remarks, I made some general comments about the evolution of our thinking. One aspect of this was, as we looked at the debottleneck opportunities available to us in ammonia, and we were looking at debottlenecking of a large number of plants, and added up the amount of ammonia and we compared that with the amount of upgrade product that we were seeking to produce, that we were actually reducing our free ammonia supply. And so that's when we began to think that significantly more ammonia production was required to get us to the outcome that we wanted. And I think it's also important for you to note that in addition to having more ammonia production, we've added 1.3 million tons of urea to the mix here. So we're getting a substantially big bang for the additional bucks we're spending.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. Just following up on that, I assume that you're giving the guidance in some of your comments today, that maintenance CapEx right now is about $350 million to $400 million for the company. Could you also give us an -- and just please comment on that? And could you also give us an idea of once the new capacity is online, maybe where maintenance CapEx could be around?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, I think your introductory comment is fair, $350 million to $400 million is a reasonable steady-state estimate for today. I can't project what our maintenance capital will be in 2016. It'll be -- I guess I would say it'll be modestly higher. Tony, you want to add to that?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. I would say, you'll see probably more impact from inflationary factors than you'd do from the fact that we've got a couple of additional operating units that go through turnarounds periodically. But I wouldn't expect, absent changes in inflation, for it to be radically outside the range of $350 million to $400 million that we're in today.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Picken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to talk a little bit about sort of the forward purchase program. And it seems like you're further ahead on UAN and some of the other products. And I was just wondering kind of -- if that was something that you think was more your customer's choice or just what you guys sort of made available to the customers?","Bert A. Frost","On our specific product -- our forward sold position, I would say we're adequately sold. We're pleased with our forward sold book. Each of the product has a different profile. And you mentioned UAN, and we're pleased with where we are with UAN. We're active in the market everyday and selling products and still have a remaining position to sell.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Great. I guess sort of phrased differently -- I mean -- I guess, does it reflect the fact that you're maybe further ahead, at least on UAN? Does that sort of reflect maybe that you're -- or you and the dealers have more of the same expectations of kind of where that market is headed versus, let's say, ammonia prices, which have been particularly strong over the last couple of months?","Bert A. Frost","I would take it more from an end perspective because of the high acres expected to be planted in corn and the need to get nitrogen every year to the ground. When we did our fall sell or fall filling period for UAN, it started around the end of June and continued through July. I would say, all of our customers took positions that they are comfortable with. Parallel to that, we also were selling ammonia for the fall application period, which is where we are today. And as we mentioned earlier, on our previous call, urea has been coming in and our customers have been purchasing that also. So I would say that they all have been -- our customers have been active in all 3 nitrogen products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Neivert with Dahlman Rose.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. One, you guys said the ammonia applications in the beginning and the way things look, it should be a good year, weather permitting. So far, is weather cooperating? Or are we not getting the cooperation we'd like to see at this point? I know we have time, but...","Stephen R. Wilson","Go ahead, Bert.","Bert A. Frost","Well, I would say, when you look at the weather map today, it's been ideal. We received the moisture in late August through September and early October, where some of the areas that were severely impacted by the drought are actually, on a soil-moisture basis, doing very well. There are some areas that have received excess moisture in the form of rain and now snow, and that would be in North Dakota. But you have to look at the total picture, with harvest coming off in places 4 weeks early, which allowed for adequate soil preparation or ground preparation. And the P and the Ks went down, and now they're putting down ammonia. So it's going well. And weather permitting, we anticipate we will have a normal ammonia application season.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the other -- you said that a number of things that impacted ammonia prices to the upside earlier, with outages and things of that nature. For the most part, are those back online now? Or are we still seeing the same or similar outages? Or where do we stand? And in conjunction with that, how about the nitrogen startups that were supposed to be coming through in -- I guess it was Algeria and the Middle East? Qatar, I believe.","Bert A. Frost","Yes. What you're referencing on ammonia, that's a world that's driven by producers outside of the United States. And Trinidad has been suffering through a shortage of gas. It's hit all the producers you have, as well as that -- announced over the last several weeks, cutbacks in Egypt on gas supply. And we've had a high level of operating rates for the phosphate producers, so demand has been very positive. The supply and demand impacted together has driven prices up over the $700 metric ton Tampa. So that's very -- that has also driven the United States in terms of what is available on ammonia. Your second question on startups, the COFCO plants are running. We are not anticipating -- we are following the sulfured urea or non-export of product out of the sulfur plants. And they are -- we don't -- we're not exactly sure when they will begin exporting products.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So COFCO is back in the market, all 6 -- 5, 6 operations they've got. And you're just waiting for the Algerians. Again, Algeria was a combination of ammonia, urea, but it's going out as urea. Is that the case there?","Bert A. Frost","I am not sure. And regarding COFCO, yes, it's our assumption that all 6 are operating.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez with Lazard Capital.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Steve, quick question. I mean, you have committed significant capital over the next 3 years, between Medicine Hat, share repurchase and the expansion projects. Can you talk about how you plan on funding for all those projects? I mean, is it going to be from cash flow? Or you're going to have to take debt and so forth?","Stephen R. Wilson","Good morning, Edlain. Yes, so I'll do the math for everybody. We have $3 billion under the share repurchase program to almost $1 billion for the 1\/3 of Medicine Hat to $3.8 billion. To the expansion projects, I think the total comes at $7.7 billion, which is a lot of money. On the other hand, the cash flow profile of this company is very robust, and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. But we don't know, obviously, the pattern of our cash flow on the inflow side over the next several years, but we continue -- we think it will continue to be very strong. We'll be mapping out our cash outflows, looking at the capital projects and our own internal assumptions about share repurchase, et cetera. It is possible that, in order to make this all fit together, that we would access the capital markets. And if we do so, we would do -- we will be doing so from strength. And we have an investment-grade credit rating today. We intend to maintain the metrics that are consistent with an investment-grade rating. And we feel quite confident that we can do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Cox with Piper.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","My first question is on the wheat crop. Given some of the dry conditions, do you expect any impact for winter wheat nitrogen demand?","Bert A. Frost","Winter wheat is -- the soil or the ground preparation takes place in August and September, with the application of ammonia ending around the beginning of October. So that season has already passed. Yes, it has been dry. Some of those farmers plant wheat without fertilizer because as the crop emerges then it goes dormant and then you can apply again in February. And so what we have seen out of the wheat region is positive consumption, and we anticipate a robust application season, probably starting in January, February when the wheat crop emerges from dormancy.","Michael E. Cox - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just quickly on the urea market. Given though the softness we've seen in pricing there and the likely drop off in export activity, have you held back in any forward sales of urea to account for that?","Bert A. Frost","Well, softness is depending on what side you're sitting on. Again, if $400 is where we are today, historically that's a very -- it's a good number, and we're pleased with that and pleased with our performance in the market. And so yes, you do see oscillations that are driven by supply and demand, and I do think that we will receive additional imports from various exporting countries to the United States. However, we do believe that inventories are low throughout the world, whether that be South America or Europe. And we see a positive market going forward for urea no matter if these additional plants come online or not. You have China that will be ceasing their export window, or has -- the export window has closed and what remains in the bonded warehouse will be exported. But we think come January, that market should -- the urea market around the world should be positive.","Stephen R. Wilson","I'd like to add a more general comment about this urea market. We are now seeing, for the last 1.5 years or so, urea prices in a range from, let's say, $350 or $400, up to as high as $700. And if we live in that world of urea prices going forward, our shareholders should be very happy with our investment decisions. That's a great place for the urea market to oscillate between.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Massoud.","Paul A. Massoud - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, it's Paul Massoud from Stifel. Yes, I just -- I had a question on the nitrogen price. I mean, given where pricing has gone for the different products, have you seen any pushback from dealers with respect to where ammonia prices have gone? For example -- and potentially, so can you talk about the potential for substitution between the different products?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, just a general comment about nitrogen prices and fertilizer prices. Traditionally, the cost of fertilizer takes about 19% of the farmer's revenue dollar. But today, we are in the range of 15%, 16%. So prices -- the price of fertilizer is not a problem for farmer economics, even though, of course, farmers will complain about the prices of inputs no matter how much money they are making. That's just what it's like being a farmer. With respect to individual products, even at today's price level, ammonia is still the best value per unit of nitrogen. That's why farmers who have experience applying ammonia and who are comfortable continuing to apply it will almost always choose ammonia if field conditions allow them to do so.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Swenson for closing remarks.","Dan Swenson","Thank you, Darcella.

My name is Michelle. I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today, Mr. Martin Jarosick, CF Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.","Martin Jarosick","Good morning and. And thanks for joining the CF Industries full year and fourth quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Chris Bohn, CFO; and Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development and Supply Chain.","CF Industries reported its full year and fourth quarter 2019 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook and then host a question-and-answer session.","Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements. More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.","Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on our website.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","Tony Will","Thanks Martin and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the full year 2019, in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.6 billion a nearly 15% increase over 2018. We efficiently converted our EBITDA into cash, generating over 900 million in free cash for the year.","As shown on Slides 6 and 7of our materials we're the most efficient converter of EBITDA into cash in the industry. Additionally, we have the best free cash flow yield. These results reflect the impact of lower year-over-year natural gas costs for the company, higher product price, realizations and outstanding execution by the CF team.","We operated our plant extremely well all year and set a new quarterly ammonia production record in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we produce more than 10.2 million tons of ammonia and delivered sales volumes of 19.5 million product tons. Most impressively, we did all this safely.","Our 12 month rolling recordable incident rate at the end of 2019 was 0.48 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is the lowest year end rate ever at CF. We are tremendously proud of this achievement. And I want to thank everyone at CF who makes safety their top priority every day.","In 2019, we delivered a one year total shareholder return of 13%, which was well above each member of our fertilizer peer group for the year, as you can see on Slides 9 and 10. We have outperformed our peer group index over one, three, five, seven and 10 years for total shareholder returns. And we were the single best performing company overall with one of these time periods.","We believe this consistent long-term out performance relative to our peers reflects the enduring structural and operational strengths of our company. Our structural advantages are clear, we provide a nutrient that is non-discretionary and for which demand continues to grow. We are among the lowest cost producers of nitrogen in the world due to our access to low cost and plentiful North American natural gas and we operate in import dependent regions.","We also have created operational advantages for our company by investing in our assets and our people. We have the highest ammonia utilization rate in North America and our production sites have the flexibility to switch quickly between products to meet demand and maximize profits. We also have outstanding logistics capabilities in North America's most extensive distribution network. These advantages have enabled us to efficiently generate significant cash flow.","Since the beginning of 2017, we have deployed nearly $4 billion in cash to strengthen our balance sheet, increase shareholder participation in our nitrogen business and return cash to shareholders. We believe we are the best position company in the industry to continue to build on this track record of creating long-term shareholder value in the years ahead.","Looking forward to 2020 we remain focused on safe and reliable operations and disciplined management of the company. As we've said before, we believe our operational performance will consistently deliver sales volumes between 19 and 20 million product tons each year and we expect to do this with one of the lowest controllable cross structures per product ton in our industry.","With that let me turn it over to Bert who'll talk more about current market conditions and our outlook. Then Chris will cover our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert Frost","Thanks Tony. Since the start of the second half of 2019 low global energy prices have supported higher industry operating rates and increased nitrogen supply availability. This pressure global nitrogen prices in the latter part of 2019 and into 2020. Global demand in the second half of 2019 was a bright spot highlighted by strong urea imports into India and Brazil. India tendered for a record volume of urea during the year due to favorable growing conditions and flat domestic production despite the startup of new capacity.","This demand along with the effect of lower energy prices and favorable exchange rates brought additional Chinese urea exports to the market, exceeding our expectations entering the year. Demand from India should remain strong in 2020, with the next India urea tender expected in March or early April. We also expect urea imports and demand in Brazil to increase over 2019 supported by the recent idling of a Petrobras ammonia urea complex and additional planted corn acres in that country.","Just like the rest of the world, North America saw lower year-over-year nitrogen prices throughout the fourth quarter. This has been reflected in North American nitrogen prices as we begin the year. Urea barge values in New Orleans at the start of 2020 were $220 per ton, compared to $275 per ton at the start of 2019. Barge prices have appreciated recently as the industry has begun to take stock of potential spring demand. However, even with the increase prices today are still lower year-over-year.","Additionally, UAN prices in North America are lower than at this point last year and priced at a discount to urea due to an influx of imports as trade flows adjust to the impact of European Union tariffs. We expect strong nitrogen demand in North America during the upcoming spring application season, which we believe will support prices. Last year we saw record prevent plant acres in the US and a weak fall ammonia season due to poor weather. Despite a challenging year, however, farm income is improved for most farmers and input costs are at decade lows. This should result in an increase in planting corn acres as a whole over 2019 if farmers see typical planting conditions.","We believe this should favor demand for nitrogen. Crop features continue to support an increase in the planting of nitrogen consuming crops. We estimate planted corn acres in the United States will be in the range of 92 million to 94 million acres. We also expect positive demand for spring ammonia, as well as upgraded products, which typically see greater demand following poor fall ammonia seasons. We're well prepared for the active spring application season we see ahead. While our expectations are for normal planting conditions, each spring brings new opportunities for CF to leverage our extensive logistics and distribution capabilities. We are ready for whatever arises and look forward to working with our customers for a successful spring application season.","With that let me turn the call over to Chris.","Chris Bohn","Thanks Bert. For the full year of 2019, the company reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $493 million or $2.23 per diluted share. Our EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA were both approximately $1.6 billion.","Lower natural gas costs year-over-year were a substantial factor in our financial performance in 2019. This was especially true in the second half when significantly lower natural gas prices compared to 2018 supported our results despite lower product prices.","Looking ahead to 2020 we expect natural gas costs to continue to provide a tailwind, particularly in the first half of the year. This should partially offset the impact of lower year-over-year product prices. Our full year net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $915 million.","In 2019, we continue to deploy capital in line with our long standing priorities. We redeemed 750 million in debt, lowering our gross debt to $4 billion. We returned $265 million to shareholders through dividends and we repurchased 7.6 million shares for $337 million. As a result, cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the year were $287 million. This is in line with our stated target of $300 million to $500 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Given our significantly reduced fixed charges, and our undrawn $750 million revolver, we believe this provides the liquidity we need to run the business through the cycle. Looking ahead to 2020, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach we have taken to manage the company, prudently allocate capital and return to investment grade. This includes increasing shareholder participation in our underlying business.","Since the end of 2017, we have increased shareholder participation by nearly 10% through growth initiatives, and repurchasing nearly 8% of our outstanding shares as you can see on Slide 12. Given the current share price and our strong free cash flow generation, we believe our shares are the most attractive investment in our industry. Returning to investment grade also remains a priority.","We entered the year with greatly improved credit metrics and financial flexibility, compared to just a couple of years ago. Since the beginning of 2017, we have lowered our debt by $1.85 billion and have reduced their fixed charges by approximately $190 million on an annual basis. We are committed to redeeming the remaining $250 million of our 2021 senior secured note on or before the maturity date. We believe this will further strengthen our case for investment grade and will also achieve our goal of a strong and flexible balance sheet that is well positioned for the future.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open up the call to Q&A.","Tony Will","Thanks, Chris. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their great work throughout 2019. Their focus on safety, operating reliability and delivering for our customers continues to drive our success as a company As you've heard from Bert and Chris, lower global energy costs have pressured product prices in both Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 compared to the prior year periods and we expect this trend to continue to the first half of the year despite the expected increase in corn acres. The impact of lower year-over-year product prices should be partially offset by lower gas costs. But our results are much more sensitive to movements in product prices than they are to movements in gas costs as you can see on Slide 13.","So as we sit here today, in the early part of 2020, with most of the year still to play for and understanding the highly volatile and sometimes unpredictable nature of global commodity prices, we would expect that full year 2020 EBITDA would fall somewhere within the range of our 2018 and 2019 results. But our focus is on free cash flow rather than EBITDA and as a reminder in both 2018 and in 2019, we generated over $900 million in free cash flow. So given that we would expect to continue executing on our capital deployment priorities of regaining investment grade, while continuing our share buyback program, investing in the most attractive shares in the industry.","Longer term, our company remains among the best position in the world. Our structural advantages are clear. We produce the only non-discretionary nutrient nitrogen. We have access to low cost North American natural gas and we operate in the important dependent regions. We believe these advantages will continue to drive strong free cash flow generation through the cycle and enable us to build on our track record of creating superior long-term shareholder value compared to our competitors.","With that operator we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","As a courtesy to others on the call, we ask that you limit yourself to one question should you have additional questions, we ask that you ranch the queue.

Your line is open.","Christopher Parkinson","Great, thank you very much. Regarding the UAN market, can you just talk about the evolution of global trade flows and how you see them kind of moving in 2020, including out of the US? And then also the progress you've made in Latin America, regarding your market development efforts. And if you could hit on that, as well as just the USs net position, from your perspective, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Tony Will","Good morning, the UAN market has been growing. We believe that it is a very good product, due to its flexibility and adaptability and blend ability. And we're seeing that growth taking place in South America as you mentioned. So the changes that have taken place to the global market or the recent UAN European Union sanctions that came in place at the tail end of 2019 last year, we exported \u2013 we continue to export into Europe and this year, I don't think we will. And that has really blocked a lot of the Russian or most of the Russian product, as well as Trinidadian. We don't believe that this is a fair nor just nor correct result. And we think that there will be some issues and contentions and disputes regarding what the decision was. But what that has caused a disruption in the flows.","And so our position is that it takes a while for those flows to rebalance for different companies to make different products and to develop different markets. We've been focused on that end of the situation developing different markets. Since we brought up the production in 2000 or before we brought up the production 2017. So we've been working in South America as well as what we were shipping in Europe. And our growth markets have been Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, shipping to all those and not much of that existed outside of Argentina five years ago. And we projected that will be a million ton market in 2020 and growing every year from there on out.","When you look at UAN as the balanced product to CFs portfolio, well we start with ammonia, then we make different sub products and so what we've been able to do because of the decisions we made in construction \u2013 constructing the new facilities, was we had tremendous flexibility of maximizing urea or UAN or sub products like DEF and nitric acid and we are utilizing those capabilities today and producing less UAN. So you've seen a reflection of CF bringing less UAN into the market, rebalancing our customer portfolio, pursuing more business on the east and west coasts, developing some new terminals in the interior as well as what I just explained in South America. So we're \u2013 we feel like we're well prepared, you're going to see us continue to execute and focus on growth and opportunities. And we believe that UAN is a very good product and on a price differential where it's under urea today, we believe that over time rebalance would be equal to or greater than urea.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne","Yes, just may be continuing on this topic, Bert. When you look out at the spring demand in the US, you look at, say channel inventories. You look at the lineup of imports coming into the US.","Do you see the potential that urea in the spring could get short? And conversely do you expect UAN to remain long and how have your outlook for these products affected your forward sales book for these products?","Bert Frost","Good morning, Steve and so I'm always optimistic, but I always played defensive game and that's preparing for eventualities and not to put the company in a negative position. So it's a combination of what you just explained. Channel inventories we think are adequate especially for the first round as product starts moving to the ground, but when you look at what we've \u2013 what has happened with ammonia, ammonia being the building block not only of producing the upgraded products, but to the farm community ammonia has always been a base load for the ice states as well as Nebraska and some of the outlying states. And that has generally been about 4 million ton product per year moved through our terminals and the other providers terminals. We had a poor fall ammonia season, so that end needs to transition to spring. And so we're projecting to have a healthy demand for ammonia around that 4 million ton range urea, around 11 million to 12 million in UAN, exceeding 15 million tons.","And so for a global market, North America is three quarters of UAN demand today, around that number. And so looking at what has come in, we have received too much up and into the market. And that's reflected in pricing, especially on some of the coastal markets. And so do we need to balance? Well, we've added capacity and others have added domestic capacity. And so there's probably about a 2 million ton requirement of UAN and imports and we're probably a little bit over that. And again, that's reflected in pricing urea. We're importing 4 million to 5 million tons and if you look what's been brought in to date and what's in the lineup, we still have substantial needs to meet. And we're preparing for that demand to materialize with our interior storage and production and positioning product. And so we have a good order book on and we're going to continue to build on that order book and have product in place for that second round and third round when people need just in time inventory. So our outlook is positive for the spring, especially for the interior.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Could we gain your thoughts on the new Gulf Coast ammonia project and what that may mean for reinvestment economics? Do you consider that kind of a one off situation or the sign that where we might see some future expansion from the industry more broadly?","Tony Will","Yeah. Good morning, John. My perspective is that if your air products, this is a great project, because they get to \u2013 get better utilization of their existing hydrogen production along the pipeline, they get to expand their pipeline and build a new SCR and as long as you've got a credit worthy off taker, you can get very good returns on that kind of business. So I can absolutely understand why your product wants to do it. I think if you are the back end of the ammonia process it's less clear as to this project actually makes sense. And our understanding is the sponsors who are the off takers from their products suggests that they need a dramatic increase in ammonia pricing, kind of getting Tampa up north of $350 per ton in order to make a reasonable rate of return on that kind of project. And today Tampa isn't anywhere close to that number. So my hope is that they actually earn a great return on that project because that would suggest that the rest of our business is coming along really well. But it's a bet on the comp and based on where global energy prices are and the amount of ammonia production is in the world, it's hard to see that that's certainly not a bet that I would be making today. And it's hard for me to believe that there's a lot of other people stepping up in line to double down on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open,","Donald Carson","Yes, Bert, just trying to get a sense of how much of the fall ammonia application season we missed and what the implications are for additional demand this spring. How much the growers have to make up? How much do you think they'll make up in ammonia versus urea or UAN?","Bert Frost","Yeah, looking at the fall of '19 compared to the fall of '18, in the fall of '18, we had a wonderful run in Canada, the northern tier weaker in the southern tier. In '19 it was kind of weak everywhere. The north never got started Canada, North Dakota and that area, Minnesota, just due to cold wet and then snow. And that was delayed in the south. But then we had a warming trend in December and got some loads out in the southern Illinois area. So really throughout most of the Midwest, Iowa was okay, what we expect is that for precise number, I would say several hundred thousand tons need to move into spring. And probably that will be made up with upgraded products we're expecting a normal spring for ammonia which we didn't have in '19. And where product is priced today, urea is a little bit higher and UAN is a bit of a value right now as well as ammonia. So it's going to be interesting to see what value plays, what tradition plays, what practices farmers will apply in 2019 and that's why our balanced approach seems to work pretty well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning, everyone. I had a question about some of your price realizations for urea and UAN. In the last four or five quarters, you've achieved really good price premiums to somewhat arbitrary NOLA benchmarks. In '17 and '18 especially for UAN what you were realizing versus NOLA benchmark was kind of flipping up and down between a premium and a discount, this goes back maybe some of the numbers you would have seen a few years ago. So I guess I want to ask, is there something going on that in terms of your book in the market that import and export dynamic that lets you now achieve sort of a better premium than sort of good consistent premiums to these benchmarks or maybe help me understand the dynamic Thanks.","Tony Will","Yeah, Joel, I mean, my flipping respond was \u2013 response would be the team and \u2013 but I actually want to give credit to the team we've over the years have built an internal team of talent and diverse talent and with an effort towards utilizing different skills and languages and experiences and that takes time and we've put some people in some positions that have really done a great job and I like the way our incentive program works where we as a team, everybody works towards the same goal which is the betterment of CF Industries. So we're all rowing in the same direction that really helps with focus on \u2013 if urea or UAN and those product leaders are more focused on what's better for CF, we have that conversation every day. The other issue is the river and there have been logistical issues which we identified early or have been able to capitalize on later because of our distribution system and unique logistical assets. And so it helps to put the company in that position as we prepared in the past. And then so what we're seeing is we have differentiated production in Canada and Northern Iowa, as well as the Donaldsonville. So we have arbitrage exports against imports and when that is advantages to the company we've chosen to export, so a combination of all those factors that put us in a good spot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews and Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jeremy Rosenberg","Hey guys, this is Jeremy Rosenberg on Vincent. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to ask one on n China. Thinking about the headlines we've been seeing on the coronavirus. I want to get your thoughts on if that could potentially weaken domestic urea demand in China and free up even more tons for export and I saw your export expectations were brought up from 1 million to 3 million to 2 million to 3 million, but just not fun and coronavirus there. Thanks.","Tony Will","So the impact as we see it is unfolding. What was announced yesterday with the additional deaths and disclosures is scary because it's probably spread farther, further and deeper than we're understanding. So what is the impact of that? It's the ability to operate. The demands today that are being made to please show up to work from the Chinese government for your national duty is troubling when you're risking potential injury to you or your family members. So our take on the virus today, its impact is on logistics and production. Will the mines be opened their short call today and inventory levels from our reports are at low levels? And so the ability to move and to keep that moving and then that extends into feed and just in time deliveries of feed for protein growth.","And so the potential is you unravel this thing where does urea shipments to exports rank in the pantheon of needs is probably not very high. And so I think it's going to be not much urea comes out of the Hubei province, its more phosphate. So I think the first price differential will be on phosphates because of limited exports when China has been the marginal producer in that area. But overall, we're predicting fewer exports out of China anyway. And this will just further exacerbate that situation. And that's why we're more comfortable and confident with a tightening of the market. China was the marginal producer and more tons did come out than we had expected in 2019. We don't see that repeating in 2020.","Bert Frost","Yeah, I completely agree. I think if anything, this is going to be a negative impact on supply from coming out of China as opposed to negatively impacting demand because on the demand side, people are still got to eat, so \u2013 and this bird says that whether it's coal mines or urea plants, those are the places where I think you're going to see a reduction in labor hours. So we would expect it to be kind of nothing like this has ever a net positive, but from a humanity perspective, but relative to urea supply, it probably will tighten it up.","Tony Will","And I'd say we're positive then protein exports to China, and then positive the feed grains and oil seeds from the United States and Brazil. So that's going to be \u2013 again, the thing has to unfold, but those are the areas that I would see needs materializing from China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Connelly of Stephens. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. We've seen some increases in freight rates in a number of markets. I'm curious if that's having any impact or if you expect it to have impacts just on where urea products going whether it's yours or somebody else's?","Bert Frost","Yes, the IMO impact is being felt. And you're right, there were some increases \u2013 we saw more substantial increases in the liquid rates coming out of NOLA, as we looked at some exports to South America at the turn of the year. And then we believe we'll have further costs \u2013 we think the net benefit because we're such a domestic producer is increased costs for those coming to the United States. And so is that a $10, $20 we've seen substantial bids in the short-term, does that balance out longer term, but I think it will add structural costs and that would add to our cost curve for those bringing tons into NOLA or the \u2013 either west or east coast, so for us, it's a net positive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi, good morning. Looks like national gas price in North America are now at borderline absurdly low levels; is there any thoughts about trying to lock in these kind of low rates long-term? Are you continuing to do spot is the strategy?","Bert Frost","Yeah. No, good question. Where gas is trading today is about $1.85. It's been as low as $1.76 at Henry Hub, the basis weighed to CF it's even lower. So it's a very nice place to be and we're very thankful for being a North American producer locking in North American gas. But you're right. The question is do you lock in or do you play the daily or a combination thereof and that's what we have chosen to do is to play a combination. There's time period during the year, where risk mitigation is the responsibility of the natural gas procurement team and that's winter, November, December, January, February, and sometimes into March we have cold weather and high demand and you're pulling gas from the storage cavities that are placed throughout the United States. Then sometimes basis blows out like we've seen in these polar vortex years where they can be $50 or $100 over the spot price. And so a combination of protecting the company is prudent, but a combination of realizing that there are excess gas availability and limited places for it to go until pipelines get built out or increased demand and power generation or LNG exports materialize. Net-net worth positive end of that curve and so you've seen us achieve better realized values than the market is predicted and that's because we've played a balanced game of how we acquire that gas for the company. I can't \u2013","Tony Will","But I think as we sit here today, Jonas we're getting close to the end of winter, although it's snowing in Chicago, but as you look at the number of cold days last week, it's been a mild winter, storage levels have increased, gas production continues to be very high. In our view there's probably price pressure coming instead of this is the low point. And so we're very positive in terms of buying daily or month ahead as opposed to taking long-term lock positions. The other issue though, is in terms of the forward curve, you can't lock two years out or three years out at today's values because the curve starts increasing. And so that's why as Bert said, there's a little bit of a mixed bag in terms of how we approach it. But structurally we're very optimistic about low gas costs through the balance of the year.","Bert Frost","What I do like is the forward spread to Europe and to Asia and the NBP and JKM. If you look at that, we expand out to a $2 to $3 spread, just based on forwards for each of the markets. That's again and when you throw in the previous question on freight rates puts us at a very good cost position for the Western markets being North America and South America and positions as well for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Tony Will","Good morning.","P.J. Juvekar","So you mentioned lower energy prices incented nitrogen production last year. As we start 2020 it seems like energy prices are even lower. What does that mean for global production this year? And then I just want to make sure that I heard you right. I think Bert you said that you expect more imports of grains and pork into China, as a result of this virus outbreak. I just want to make sure I heard that right. Thank you.","Bert Frost","So the question was speculation. And so the answer was in line of potential outcomes and a potential outcome clearly would be increased because the question was, if urea production is unable to produce at the rate that they need, and then move that into the market, as they're entering their spring peak demand, which is about now that would be a yield impact of corn, wheat and vegetables and fruits. Therefore, the need would be to augment or replace that value \u2013 carbohydrate value and protein value with imports. That's where I was going with the thinking. Regarding your question on \u2013 yes, increased end production happened as well as increased output in exports in that export curve, but as a combination or flexion of higher prices. As we entered 2019 the NOLA price was $275. As we entered 2020 it was s $220 for urea.","The Chinese tons that came out and went to India at one tender averaged $280 a ton metric FOB, the next tender was $260 a metric ton FOB. So energy prices were lower and product prices were higher. And guess what happened over time product prices fell to a level that doesn't make it attractive enough. We believe for some of those extraneous or excess tons to make it in the market. Therefore a correction takes place and a slowdown which we're seeing in production. China has run based on let's say 78 million tons of static capacity has run between 55% and 70% and that's how we get to our numbers of what was produced, exported and consumed internally. And that and some other questions I think with like Brazil, the Petrobras plant shutting down and some others that are experiencing higher gas values and an inability to bring in the low value LNG will correct the market then so \u2013 and I just think that's where we're going to be and while our expectations of trade at higher values as we progress year-on-year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Hi, I just wanted to talk a little bit about your strategy on UAN here in the US and I know you had the initial summer fill program and you had a recent fill program. Maybe you could talk to us about kind of how that program sort of reached your expectations and how you sort of balance the needs of some of your customers and making sure they're not underwater versus the need to keep imports out. Now, it's always a tricky balance. Thanks.","Bert Frost","Yeah, we are a North American participant, a large 90 plus percent of our volume is directed, focused and attended to this market. And we do participate in the export market and we built some great relationships, but we utilize that as an arbitrage when the value is attractive or timing is attractive, for example, when we're in a low demand period and some of those places are in higher demand periods. So our UAN strategy is and has been focused on the United States. However, in previous years before our capacity expansion, there were areas due to logistical difficulties we had \u2013 we weren't able to reach and so we added capacity. We have rebalanced our system and then have worked with some of our logistics providers to access some of those markets and then started targeting places where we should participate and we're adding some tanks in California converting some tanks in other areas that are already owned, leasing some tanks in other areas where we think we should be participating.","And Cincinnati is a good example. We were not active in Cincinnati, today its several hundred thousand tons for CF, a very good market. We will continue to grow in areas like that utilizing our domestically produced tons where we're logistically favored and then the remainder is what we'll export, so we feel pretty good about that. We work with our customers. We have an extensive customer list from a few hundred tons per year to a million tons per year. And you're right that conversations, we want our customers to make money. They need to make money and that's the business that they're in is serving the farmer. We serve the wholesaler, the retailer, the coops that serve those farmers and so that's a combination of conversation and understanding where they are and what farmer economics are to make sure our products are appropriately priced and generally against imports. That is our competitor and to position \u2013 and then out marginal ton in some of the coastal markets we're competing directly with Russian and Trinidadian production, we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe continuing in UAN and say different light and Bert, Tony I was hoping to get your thoughts on the UAN cost curve. I mean, it's obviously different focus, Trinidad, US, Russia are the principal producers with NOLA prices kind of where they are in the in the 110 to 120 range. Are some of those producers now underwater? I mean, how do we think about capacity rationalization there that might be getting forced at these price levels and\/or just on the other side, the demand response domestically of UAN trading at such a big discount to urea. I'm just trying to think about how this price disparity kind of closes over time.","Tony Will","Yeah, I mean, I think, I don't know, I'll give you sort of my quick take and then I'll throw it over to Bert for the real answer. But my view on this one is the companies that are \u2013 or the region that is probably the most at risk from an economic standpoint, I think is going to be Trinidad because most of the favorable Caribbean gas indexed contracts are kind of rolling off or have rolled off and the renegotiation with NGC has happened that higher price levels. You've seen a couple of plants on the island actually close as a result of not being competitive any More. And given that Europe is no longer really a destination option for that production, I think that puts a pretty big challenge on those plants.","Relative to Russian production and in the US, we're still fine. If you look at UAN, the margin structure is still well superior to that of ammonia and on a $1 per nutrient ton it's still a very attractive product for us to make relative to having excess ammonia. I think anyone know that has an ability and flexibility in their system to upgrade into different product types like we do into producing more urea, urea liquor, DEF and nitric acid and not making UAN that turns out to be a great margin opportunity for us. And I think some of the Russian producers are making more AN and doing some other things with upgraded products as well.","So our view is the \u2013 over the longer term, I think you're right, given where values are today to a farmer you might see incremental growth in terms of switching toward UAN in the near term over the longer term because it is a more capital intensive process to make UAN that it is urea, you've got to earn a fair rate of return on that incremental capital otherwise people stop investing in it. And so we would expect margins to kind of \u2013 once you get through the trade flow rebalance to get back to as Bert said earlier, kind of net neutral between UAN and urea or even positive UAN. So I think this is kind of like what we saw in '16 and '17 where the new capacity came on and it took a year or two to \u2013 for trade flows to rebalance. And for us to really kind of get our sea legs under us and the same things going on right now globally with UAN and the European anti-dumping situation. Bert?","Bert Frost","No, I think it's good.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benjamin Isaacson of Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Ziad on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe dragging back to the inventories you were talking about earlier. I believe you were describing them as like adequate inventory levels now and how the system kind of demands about 4 million tons of ammonia. Could you talk maybe a little bit about what those inventory levels are specific to that in light of the week application season specific to ammonia where people \u2013 where farmers have been consuming other end products to kind of make up for that. Thank you.","Tony Will","The ammonia system from an inventory standpoint is that there's a cap on it because it's really sitting for the most part with three major producers Coke, Nutrien and CF are the ones that have the y cryogenic storage tanks or terminals in market. And while there's some storage at plant locations generally speaking, it's not more than 50 or 100,000 tons. And so the vast majority of the inventory sits with the three producers and there's a limit in terms of what that looks like. So in order to get the 4 million tons out, you actually need relatively \u2013 given a week fall, you need to be able to resupply some of those tanks.","So if you end up in a situation where weather is not cooperating in terms of being able to dump the tank and then resupply it and get more than one ton in the spring, it's going to push farmers toward upgraded products simply because you can't get the amount of nutrients that you need to from the ammonia system. That said given the weak, fall we think the tank situation is relatively full and ready to go. So I think in terms of whether you get to the 4 million tons is really dependent upon kind of how early the fields open up to begin ammonia application and how long that lasts for and if you have a situation like we had last spring, you're not going to see anywhere close to 4 million tons get out.","Bert Frost","When you look at how that system is balanced, it's in a combination with your \u2013 or our and others logistics \u2013 or industrial customers and those that have a ratable 360 day demand and we supply that as well as exports. So we've been exporting and then rebalancing the system through shipments to our terminals or our plants and that gives benefit or we have the benefit of our logistical options. We have the ammonia barges, we have the ammonia pipeline, we have our own rail cars and we lease or work with our truck providers to move that products. We feel very good about whatever will take place in the spring that will be ready.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wong of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. If your telephones muted, please unmute.","Andrew Wong","Hey, good morning, sorry about that. So with investor interest in ESG picking up a lot over the last couple of years, can you just maybe highlight what CF can do or maybe has already done to raise its profile in that area? Thanks.","Tony Will","Yeah, I mean, I think from an ESG perspective, there's four or five planks here that we're focused on. The first is that nitrogen is actually a product that is very beneficial to, from a global perspective, carbon emissions. And the reason for that is, even though agriculture certainly depends upon which agency look at is estimated somewhere between 25% and 30% of \u2013 responsible for 25% to 30% of aggregate greenhouse gas emissions. The vast majority of that comes from land use. And so as you are cutting down carbon sequestering for us in order to cultivate those acres, you're releasing a lot of carbon and you furthermore don't have the mechanism to further sequester carbon going forward.","And so the use of nitrogen allows you to increase crop density and increase yield per acre, which means that in order to feed the world's population, you need less acres in use, and net-net the world is a much lower carbon footprint by producing and using nitrogen than you are not producing nitrogen and cutting down trees in order to feed the growing population. So that's number one, which is actually our product on a net basis is beneficial instead of that negative.","The second issue is, particularly with our new plants, we're among the lowest carbon intensity producer globally. And with our plants turning on you've got Chinese coal based plants that shut down. And that, again, is sort of good from a global perspective. So I think this is one of those questions you have to ask, writ large instead of very locally. Now in addition to that, we're very focused on responsible use of the product and have invested heavily in kind of the four R plus program, which is teaching farmers best management practices to both reduce nitrogen loss to the environment, but also reduce volatilization in a way that creates nitric oxide or other emissions that are high from a carbon intensity perspective.","And then finally we are investing in our asset base in order to further reduce of what our footprint looks like on a sort of act locally kind of basis. And so, I think if you look across all of those things that we're doing, we have an exemplary yes ESG standpoint and we're reporting on a comprehensive GRI basis from a transparency and disclosure perspective. We're one of the very few number of companies that actually reports on the GRI index on a comprehensive basis instead of just on a spot or line item basis. So we feel very good about our ESG profile.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Since the beginning of the year, the price of Brent has gone from I don't know $68 a barrel to $54. How much of a difference do you think that makes to the global nitrogen fertilizer costs curve? And secondly, in fourth quarter of 2019, there were very large imports of urea into India. And how do you see India urea imports in the first half of 2020 and for the year versus the year ago period?","Tony Will","Jeff, let me handle the first part of the question and I'll throw it over to Bert to deal with India, which is \u2013 as you think about Brent coming down, there's no doubt that anyone that's receiving oil index based LNG or import gas is in a more favorable position today than they were a year ago. That said the real marginal production costs globally is still Chinese, anthracite coal. And Brent price does not really affect Chinese anthracite coal price directly. And in fact as Bert indicated, whether it's coronavirus or other things going on, you've seen actual coal price strength and a little bit. So the high end of the cross curve has gone up or stayed flat relative to what looks like a bit of a windfall for some other people in more third or early fourth quartile. So it's not really affecting global pricing today, the fact that Brent has come down. Bert you want to deal with the Indian situation.","Bert Frost","Sure. So India, surprise to the upside, importing close to 10 million tons when you include the tons, so almost a 30% increase over the previous year, production stayed relatively flat, about a 25 to 3% increase and stocks are a little bit higher. So a healthy consumption base, good monsoon seasons and then good demand, big country and they've got to feed themselves and some exciting things are taking place in India with the Modi government regarding investments, infrastructure and in terms of an educated population growing population. So when I look at \u2013 we look at the going forward, we expect another tender probably late March, early April and kind of running on the same pattern, whether being equal of continued import and being the largest importing country in the world.","There are two plants that are said to come on stream at the end, kind of this year, early next year. And generally those plants have been late. And then there have been issues with feedstock supplies, and so not sure when that overall production will come on. But there are some old especially in the naphtha base plants are suspect. And so even with the increased production in 2019, or run rates they have been fairly stable in their production really, over the last five to eight years and so we see good things and we've mentioned both India and Brazil in our prepared remarks in terms of growth \u2013 growth of demand and not necessarily too much of an increase in supply.","Tony Will","Yeah, the one thing with respect to that is despite new production coming on in India that Bert mentioned this earlier you saw aggregate production within India remain relatively flat. And so that means whether it's because of production problems at the older plants or just the fact that they're not economic to run them relative to be importing, you haven't seen this negatively impact India's imports and so that I think is a very optimistic sign around global S&D balance going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Willis of Exothermic Global. Your line is open.","Chris Willis","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was just curious with the length in the market and I recognize there's a pretty big spring potentially in the offing. Why wouldn't you have to cut back some ammonia production, maybe idol, some production in the fall and idle \u2013 throttle back a little bit some of your derivative products just to tighten things up a bit as we move into the spring? And I'm just wondering about the \u2013 what was the rationale behind doing a tender in the UAN market?","Tony Will","Thank you, Chris. I'll handle the first one on the production side and then I'll let Bert talk about our UAN programs. We're among the lowest absolute cost producer globally and so our assets should be the last ones to turn off, not the first. And there is enough production out there on a global basis that if we were to curtail, I wouldn't expect that to move the market a bit because there's sufficient supply elsewhere in the world. And so our business model is all around asset utilization, our up time and production efficiency and on the stream factor is among the highest in the world and certainly the highest in the US.","And because we're able to achieve those kind of levels, we basically get kind of the equivalent of an additional ammonia plant worth of production compared to the utilization rates that our North American competitors are able to achieve. So that's a huge competitive advantage when you think about the capital that goes into it. And even at the low prices that we're seeing out there for ammonia, it's still a very attractive product from a margin standpoint for us. And again, we would be kind of the last producer to shut down, not the first and on a full year basis last year we still just generated 21% gross margin in our ammonia segment, which is pretty remarkable that in a lot of businesses to talk about that being a depressing situation for an industrial business to achieve 21% gross margin for the full year is pretty outstanding result.","Bert Frost","Regarding the UN tender, we are always seeking ways to effectively communicate with our customers, different messages and treating our customers equally. And so there are times when some people are willing and ready to buy and want to and so announcing a tender where we have a specific period where we're receiving quotes or offers and we go through that and then select what's attractive with kind of a price point in mind allows us to have a conversation directly with customers as small as several hundred tons and up to several thousand or even larger than that. And so we've utilized that now for the second time at different points and it's I think a unique form to have that conversation that sparks further conversations. This isn't a static market because we're a commodity that is used to make a commodity, but we're buying a quality of all these interactions, as well as logistical interactions and time and values are different at different times. And that's why we want to interact as much as possible and have that dialogue to make sure we're positioning our company correctly.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today.

My name is Huey, and I'll be your coordinator for today.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Martin Jarosick, with CF Investor Relations. Sir, please proceed.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for joining the CF Industries first quarter earnings conference call. I'm Martin Jarosick, Vice President Investor Relations for CF. With me today are Tony Will, CEO; Dennis Kelleher, CFO; Bert Frost, Senior Vice President of Sales, Market Development, and Supply Chain; and Chris Bohn, Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries reported its first quarter 2018 results yesterday afternoon. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail, discuss our outlook, and then, host a question-and-answer session.","Statements made on this call and in the presentation on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statements.","More detailed information about factors that may affect our performance may be found in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. Also, you will find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in the press release and presentation posted on the website.","Now, let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the first quarter of 2018, in which, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $296 million after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release. We also added $100 million of cash to the balance sheet, which is on top of a temporary increase in working capital from higher inventory as a result of delayed spring shipments. As product shipments continue to progress in Q2 and inventory levels fall, we will pull that extra cash back out.","This is solid performance in the quarter where cold and wet weather delayed fertilizer purchases and applications across the Northern Hemisphere. It reflects strong execution by the CF team, capitalizing on lower North American natural gas costs and higher global nitrogen prices despite the delayed spring and delayed shipments.","Our safety performance continued to be outstanding through the quarter as our rolling 12-month recordable incident rate was down to 0.60 incidents per 200,000 work hours. This is our lowest rate ever and well below industry averages. It is a tribute to our employees' ongoing focus. And because of their focus and commitment, our plants continued to run very well. Despite multiple disruptions of electricity supply at our Donaldsonville plant, along with plant turnarounds and maintenance activities across the system, we produced more than 2.5 million tons of gross ammonia, equal to the first quarter of last year.","Additionally, we continue to enjoy the benefits of location as our structural advantage from access to low cost North American natural gas is growing. While energy costs in many other parts of the world were rising, ours were falling. In fact, during the quarter, the majority of our inland plants had natural gas costs lower than Henry Hub due to favorable basis differentials. We expect this favorable situation to persist.","Our in-region assets have access to some of the most productive gas basins in North America. Technology is improving rapidly and increasing the ability to extract natural gas at ever lower costs. As a result, we expect to remain at the low end of the global cost curve. Along with the favorable North American natural gas environment, we are seeing more balance in the global supply and demand for nitrogen driven by reduced production in high cost regions, notably Eastern Europe and China. This is supporting global urea prices well above the lows of 2017.","Producers in China face high energy prices year-over-year along with increased environmental regulation and enforcement. The impact of these factors is best illustrated in the dramatic decline of Chinese urea exports. Through the first quarter, Chinese urea exports were 77% lower than the same period in 2017.","But the impact is not limited to China and Eastern Europe. Two unprofitable urea plants in Brazil are expected to close later this year and production in Trinidad has been interrupted due to gas availability. The factors that helped drive our first quarter performance will support our cash generation over the long-term, access to low-cost North American gas, the strength and flexibility of our network, our best-in-class safety and asset utilization and the consistent ever growing demand for nitrogen.","With the recovery in nitrogen already underway, we expect to benefit disproportionately going forward.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert who will talk about the current market environment in more detail. Then Dennis will discuss our financial position before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Weather was a dominant theme for the industry in the first quarter. Wet and cold weather delayed fertilizer applications across the Northern Hemisphere. The impact of these delays was particularly pronounced given how early the spring application season started in parts of North America in 2017. We are well prepared for this environment. Our team has done a great job leveraging the more than 3 million tons of ammonia, UAN, and urea storage that we have in North America to meet our customers' needs over the next two months.","Indeed, demand should be strong. We expect nitrogen consumption in North America to be approximately equal to last year given anticipated crop plantings. Despite delayed spring, farmers are far better situated today to catch up on plantings given the technology they employ. Further, we have seen later and reduced pre-plant applications of ammonia because of the weather. Growers unable to apply pre-plant have the option to apply post-plant and side-dress ammonia. We also anticipate strong demand for upgraded products in order to make up for the lighter than normal, early spring ammonia applications.","We believe the industry's ability to supply all this volume to all areas will be challenged by the significant logistical constraints of poor rail service, stretched trucking resources, and tighter application windows. All of these factors should enable us to capture higher prices across most segments compared to the second quarter of last year.","Over the next quarter, NOLA urea barge prices averaged \u2013 or over the first quarter, NOLA urea barge prices averaged about $13 per ton higher than the year before. In the first five weeks of the second quarter of 2018, they have averaged nearly $40 per ton higher compared to the same period in 2017. However, NOLA prices remain at a discount to international parity. NOLA urea barge prices traded at an average of $13 per ton below global parity during the first quarter, a spread that has grown in the second quarter. These prices continue to discourage excessive imports into the region.","North American urea and UAN imports from July through February has fallen 38% and 35% respectively. Even with these declines, North American urea imports will be the third highest in the world, and we will remain an import-dependent region for the foreseeable future.","The first quarter was challenging because of the weather, but these challenges play into our company's strengths. We're well-prepared for the next two months and have the team, assets, and flexibility to meet customer needs.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the first quarter of 2018, the company reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.27 and EBITDA of $302 million. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $296 million. We generated $101 million of cash during the quarter and our cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet rose to $936 million as of March 31.","Subsequent to the end of the year \u2013 sorry \u2013 subsequent to the end of the quarter, we used $388 million of our cash on hand to purchase all the remaining publicly held common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. The impact of this purchase will be reflected in second quarter cash flows. Interest expense was $60 million compared to $80 million in the first quarter of 2017 due to our repayment of $1.1 billion in high-cost debt in December of 2017.","Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2018 were $68 million. For the year, we continue to expect to spend approximately $400 million to $450 million for new activities. As we have said previously, we have a higher number of planned turnarounds in 2018 compared to 2017. The impact of these on our capital expenditures will not be felt until later this year when most of them are scheduled to begin.","I will now provide some thoughts regarding our expectations for 2018, understanding that this is subject to changes in market and other conditions. So far in 2018, our product prices have generally been higher than the same period in 2017 and we expect that trend to continue. Natural gas prices have also been favorable so far this year and we expect our natural gas costs will be lower in 2018 than in 2017.","As I mentioned earlier, we have more turnarounds in 2018 than 2017, and this will have a modest impact on production volumes in the second half of the year. Taking all of these factors into account, we believe it is likely that our adjusted EBITDA for 2018 will exceed our 2017 results.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move on to your questions, I want to thank everyone at CF for their hard work this quarter. At times, it appeared that spring would never come. But the team kept their focus, worked safely, and made sure we were well positioned for the application season when it arrived.","As we have said in the past and it continues to be true today, we view this business on a six-month and a full-year basis. Weather patterns may move product shipments and applications out of one quarter into another, but we run our plants safely and efficiently 24\/7, 365. And over the course of an application season or a year, we are roughly going to ship what we make. Gas cost is low with basis differentials in our favor. Nitrogen pricing has begun its cyclical recovery. Our plants are running very well, and spring is finally upon us. We're excited about the opportunities ahead.","With that, operator, we will now open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question in queue will come from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just to start maybe a little bit more discussion about the spring would be helpful. And as we think about the next two months and the late planting, I mean, how, can you guys help size the risk to ammonia shipments in the second quarter, and what that could do to the urea and UAN markets? And given the lower imports that we've seen of both of those products, how pricing could play out in inland markets if people need those for side and top-dress applications in May, June, and potentially even into July?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, Adam. This is Bert. And it has been an odd spring. In my 10 years back in North America, this is the latest we've seen movement. We've had some early springs and some late, and ammonia generally does go down. Over the last several years, more ammonia has moved to spring from the fall. And I think this challenges that thinking.","As we're looking at where we are today, we've seen a lot of ammonia go out the door over the last week, last probably 10 days. And so as we look at the two months forward, there is a risk to pre-plant ammonia \u2013 the volume of pre-plant ammonia that could go down. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I do anticipate some of that to move to a post-plant or a side-dress application.","Now, instead of putting down 120 pounds to 180 pounds per acre, you might put down 50 pounds to 100 pounds per acre. So, if that does happen, I think you'll see some transition into urea and UAN. And you're exactly right, that premium in the Midwest probably will either hold or expand during that period as the logistical rush to move those additional products. Because if you lose 200,000 tons to 300,000 tons of ammonia, that could be 1 million tons of UAN. So, we're pretty positive going into the next couple months, but it's going to be fast. We need to get, I think we'll see a planting report coming out next week with a large or a big acceleration in the acres planted and the percentage planted, and that will signal that the seed's in the ground and that we're having to move to urea and UAN.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Pardon me, Steve. Your line is open. Please check your mute.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Bert. Can you hear me?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We can.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","We can.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Sorry about that. I, just following up on that line of questioning you just had there. Would you say that some of the volume shortfall in the first quarter may have been somewhat intentional in that you were holding back on some of your spot sales knowing that your second quarter could get tight as you saw imports well below prior year levels?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. As you're looking at imports into the United States or into North America, since July and really since the beginning part of the year, they are lower. As I said, 38% and 35% respectively for urea and UAN. We have seen additional tons come online through new capacity from our domestic industry but there will be tons moved from Q1 and Q2. And yes, we did build inventory in anticipation of probably a normal spring and some of that will then move into Q2 just as a result of the weather as I said. So I do expect it to be tight, yes, especially up in the Midwest.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. So, a quick question. NOLA moved to a bigger discount in 2Q compared to, sorry, 1Q compared to last quarter. And it looks like the 2Q discount has grown again. And in the last quarter, you talked about, I think, that NOLA should go to a premium, so U.S. can attract all the imports. And that didn't happen. And now you're saying that no lobbying at a discount is a positive because it's discouraging imports. So, there is a little disconnect, and I'm a little confused. Can you explain your comments and drill down on this premium discount issue?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. P.J., let me go ahead and start, and then I'll throw it over to Bert here in a minute to follow up. But there's sort of an interesting phenomenon going on which is if you look back a couple of years and in sort of over a fair bit of time, a number of the Middle Eastern producers became enamored with this notion of market share in different regions. And I don't know whether this is sort of an outgrowth of the philosophy they have around oil production or other things, but they had this notion that they wanted to maintain market share in North America regardless of the fact that there was going to be this new production starting out.","So, they signed long-term off-take contracts with a number of importers that basically said we're going to ship X number of tons over to NOLA or one of the coasts and deliver it on an index minus 2% kind of basis. And effectively, what's happened then as a result of that is the Saudis, in particular, and a number of others are leaving a bunch of money on the table because there's better places from a netback perspective to take those tons, and they'd be far better off by just tendering those tons to the trading community on a FOB basis. But instead, they've signed these agreements, and so, those tons are coming here regardless. And it's a result of that that kind of put a ceiling I think a bit on NOLA pricing, so that we haven't had to go out and actually attract the incremental ton because there's already been too much committed here.","Now, from the importers' perspective, this is a great deal, right, because they sell a cheap barge. They drop the price. They tank it. They're effectively taking money out of the Saudis pockets. And then, they turn around and export those tons to other places in the world. And they're making money on the backs of the Saudis who could otherwise save a fair bit of money and keep it in their own coffer. So, we think over time, they'll wise up and they'll actually start to do things that are a little more in their own interest, instead of in the interest of the importers over here. But that's going to take some time.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I also think, don't discount the fact we are in a late spring, and you've had a pile up of these barges that Tony mentioned, and an extra month to come in, of around 800,000 tons, and that, I think pressured the market, which we didn't anticipate. Like I said, we anticipated a normal spring. And I think that discount would have evaporated sooner.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. This is Robin on for Joel. Thanks for taking my question. When you indicate similar nitrogen demand in the first half year-over-year, how much demand destruction would you expect year-over-year due to the poor weather and lower corn acres? And with the expectation of a shift to UAN and urea, should we expect higher volumes year-over-year in Q2 from those segments? Thanks.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Regarding demand destruction, we're projecting 88 million to 90 million acres of corn similar to what the USDA is projecting. Last year, we were a little bit above that. And so, when you look at the total structure of end consuming crops in North America, it's pretty constant. And so, as we extrapolate that forward to what the total consumption will be, it's fairly similar to last year. Wheat acres down, canola down in United States, wheat acres up in Canada, cotton up in the Texas region, and then corn staying as I said at 88 million acres to 90 million. And so, demand should be fairly stable. And yes, we will see some higher volumes in the aggregate especially for North America. Specific to CF, as Tony said, we produce what we produce. And then if we have excess inventory, that will be bled off in Q2 but we anticipate similar volumes to last year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Tony, if I'm right, there's some new strategy or cap allocation slides in the deck at least versus last quarter, and maybe I'm being a little semantical here, so correct me if I'm wrong. But in a couple of these slides you talk about being a leading chemical company and a lot of them seem to be about your capabilities sort of around your ability to operate assets and so forth, and then there's sort of the pursue growth within the strategic fairway quote. So, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what is the strategic fairway right now. How wide is it relative to what you're doing now? Are there things outside of fertilizer you might be interested in over time or just sort of where is your head at on all this?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Vincent, good morning. Part of the reason why we put forward, as you said, kind of a bit of the strategy and our strategic capabilities was a little bit in response to a desire, I would say, from the investment community to get some more disclosure and transparency on a number of topics, one of which was kind of just a specific crisp articulation of strategy from \u2013 and this was BlackRock that was asking for this and New York City comptrollers and a fair bit of others. And this has not changed. This has always been our longstanding strategy.","And we've talked about our strategic fairway in this context going back for five or seven years. So, there's nothing new about this. The only thing that's new is that we have put pen to paper on it and actually been pretty crisp about articulating it. And part of that is because we're in the process of doing a bit of a refresh on our board. We've had some long-serving board members that are getting close to retirement, and you don't want a big slug of board members moving off at one time and then having to add a bunch of new ones.","And so when you talk about what the strategy is for the organization, it then leads into what sort of skills and capabilities you're looking for in terms of your board members, and then we can evaluate what skills are rolling off, what do we need to replace those with. And to be able to do that in a very transparent and open way is, I think, part of what is a hallmark of good governance and good interaction with our investors. So, there's nothing in here that's new other than we're trying to be very transparent with the outside world about what's going on.","As we think about what's within our strategic fairway, I would say wherever we can leverage our core capabilities to create value is something that is somewhat open. Now, that said, I think we always have to compare that against other investment alternatives i.e. buying back our own shares. And I think we are maybe a little biased in this regard, but we believe we've got the best collection of nitrogen assets in the world. So, it puts a fairly high bar out there in terms of what something else would need to look like from an opportunity set to get us to want to invest in that, in something different other than our own assets. And that would either have to be a lot of very tangible, clear, easily identifiable, and quick to capture synergies.","Those kinds of things are more likely than not to show up in other nitrogen assets or it would have to be just an absolute screaming deal that on the face of it, everyone would look at and say yeah, that makes sense. The problem with screaming deals is there's often a reason why things are low priced to begin with, and we're pretty hesitant about that. So, it's a long way of saying there's got to be a pretty \u2013 it's a pretty high threshold to get us to think about doing something other than investing more into our own assets because we really like our asset base.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from the line of Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","It's Oliver on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. So, Chinese demand has been quite weak over the last couple years. There's been the removal of the corn subsidies, environmental policy, and now we're seeing a trend for NPK applications over direct urea which seems to be eroding some demand as well. What's your view on these, and I guess just Chinese demand going forward over the next couple of years?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think China is going to be challenged anyway on production of grains, not necessarily oilseeds \u2013 they're importing a significant amount of oilseeds \u2013 but challenged to produce the grains not necessarily due to nutrients but due to water. You have to remember 50% of the nitrogen that's consumed in China is for fruits and vegetables which are their majority crops, and they tend to be moving towards imports of the commodity crops.","The NPK change is a reality, but you have to remember there is an N as a part of the PK and that N is just urea that's melted and put into the granular for the NPK. So, we see the demand for nitrogen as being stable, stable in the context of the total production for industrial and agricultural use in China of around 52 million tons, 53 million tons.","We've been watching China for several years, and we've seen a lot of this production capacity built up and now come offline, and China seems to be moving towards a state of self-sufficiency, if a little bit in a deficit. We've seen their operating rates go down as low as 50%. Today, they are estimated to be in the 60-plus-percent range. We actually think it's higher because the denominator's changed and a lot of production has come offline permanently.","So the China story continues to evolve. We're structurally positive what is happening and think it's going to be better for the global supply-and-demand basis where more Asian tons will be supplied by the Middle East, less tons available for the Americas, which should improve the pricing structure in NOLA longer term.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. When you think about your long-term natural gas needs, has there been any changes whatsoever as it pertains to your thoughts on hedging? You've seen a lot of favorable developments in terms of basis in Oklahoma. So, has there been any way the change you're thinking about even hedging long-term basis? Just any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I'll comment a little bit and then ask Bert and Dennis to both weigh in on this. But we have a high degree of confidence in the technical capability and the resourcefulness of the engineering innovation that's going on and there are not a lot of pipeline developments that are happening quickly these days. And so, what that's doing is it's backing up gas into certain regions, Oklahoma being one of them in particular that some of our lowest cost gas in the entire system.","And so, in the near-term, we think that that's likely to persist eventually when gas and when new pipeline capacity shows up that may disappear in terms of the significant basis differential, but also if you look forward in terms of being able to hedge out that basis differential, that differential collapses on the forward hedge.","So, what we \u2013 we'll look at it and evaluate it. We do hedge basis a little bit here and there particularly in places like Dawn which feeds our Courtright facility because it was more prone to weather freeze-up challenges during the deep winter. But it's not something we're anxious to run out and do but we might do it a little bit opportunistically. It's much more likely to be on a basis spread though than it is on Henry Hub basis. Dennis do you guys want to...","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","No, I agree to what you said in terms of the only thing is it's a developing story in the scoop and stack which is Oklahoma which feeds our Woodward and Verdigris plants. And that collapse that happened Q1 is currently going, has allowed us to purchase gas in the $1.30, $1.40 maybe even $1.50 range. It's extremely attractive. And so we're evaluating as Tony said and we'll see if there's some opportunities but we're structurally positive what the gas industry is providing to us and not only is North America now when you layer in the pricing that we're able to achieve in the Midwest, the cost structure that we have in the Midwest and the logistical cost to deliver to the farmer, net net it's the lowest cost basis highest margin location in the world. Great place to be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. You may proceed your question please.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Just wanted to touch base a little bit on your dynamic. You know, NOLA urea prices have come off quite a bit but UAN has sort of held in there. Typically I know they don't always trade one to one but they, UAN tends to lag urea. Do you think UAN prices have the potential to firm a little bit or do you think they'll kind of stay where they are through the spring and then any sort of thoughts on till pricing. I know it's a little bit early but any sort of thoughts there, early reads on till?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, we're encouraged about where we are with UAN, how we've positioned ourselves for the spring. And as I said earlier if you do have this dynamic of lower ammonia volume you're going to see that transition most likely to UAN. What I like about this whole UAN urea dynamic is the premium. The premium in the Midwest and something has been talked about in our industry would collapse, quite the contrary. It's holding and has firmed at times. We're achieving a nice level of premium for our Iowa production as well as our Canadian production, and that's on urea as well as UAN.","So, most likely what will happen, you'll see the traditional spread between the two products widen a little bit in favor of UAN just because, as you said, urea has dropped off in NOLA, and we're currently trading in the $220 range for urea, and the $180 range for UAN, so you can do the, and numbers as you move up into the Midwest, that UAN number gets as high as $220, maybe even higher. And so, we'll see that unfold. We have another couple of months before we want to talk about fill. So, we'll lay that \u2013 leave that to the next conference call.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from the line of Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, just a few questions on the supply and demand looking at slide 10. I know it's not new, it's the same slide as last time, but I'm just thinking like 2019, it looks like the capacity additions are outpacing demand. So, what does that mean for prices next year? Does that indicate that the market's getting a little bit more oversupplied? And then, just longer term, I mean, a couple years ago, there's the notion that there's no new projects really being built 2020 because \u2013 2020 and beyond because prices are too low and the market tightens up considerably. But it does look like there's still more projects coming online. What does that mean for a longer-term pricing recovery in the nitrogen market? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","When you look at the supply and demand situation worldwide, we're generally always in an oversupplied market. But then, you get into the nuances of gas cost, logistical cost, domestic consumption for the producer, and the international market. We do anticipate with growth being at the 1% to 2% range and growth coming from industrial demand to continue globally and that will add on the demand side.","Yes, there have been some new plants that have come on and new projections in Nigeria and Iran and a few other locations that are low cost supply points. But when you look at the global structure we've seen that the significant move in China and we're seeing the Petrobras tons come off in Brazil. OPZ just announcing they're permanently offline in Ukraine. These are the things that happen in our industry and the inability to operate in this type of structural market relative to pricing and the economic opportunity available to a producer. So, we do see it maybe not tightening but maintaining a \u2013 heading into a good trend as we go into 2020.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I think the other thing I'd say, Andrew, on that is as we do our, this is as you know, this is a net capacity addition slide. So, it basically nets out what we can see coming against what we estimate closures to be. And, typically, we're pretty conservative in what we count as potential closures. We really do wait till it's pretty clear from an announcement perspective that stuff is going to be closed before we actually put it in there as closures. So, there is, I think, some upside to this chart and the closures could as the next few years unfold be larger in magnitude than we've estimated here.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","To that point exactly, Dennis, I think you look at what's gone on in Trinidad right now as the shape of things to come. So, TNC was off for several months because of a lack of a gas contract saying that the terms that were being offered made that plant unprofitable and they couldn't afford to do a turnaround on it. They eventually struck a deal but it's only kind of sounds like it's marginally squeaking by.","And I think the next rounds of gas contracts that come up continue to be equally challenged, if not more so, in Trinidad, particularly as you look at the fact that they've curtailed molecules going into the Atlantic LNG train there. So, our view is there are areas of the world that today are pretty substantial producers that may experience some pretty rapid decline going forward, and that's not baked into this chart.","Operator","Thank you, gentlemen. Our next question will come from the line of Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Jonas.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Curious, with these persistent discounts in NOLA, it seems to be a very inefficient global system. Is there an opportunity for you guys to do trade arbitrages? And follow up on that, is there anything that can be done to close these apart from simply waiting for the Middle Eastern producers to shape up?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we sort of do look very carefully. Do we want to send an incremental cargo up into the Midwest from Donaldsonville or do we want to export it? So Donaldsonville's got a very good set of docks and ability to export, and we've got the opportunity to do that. So when we have a chance to get better netbacks to D'ville, we'll go ahead and export urea. And that's been happening, I would say, on a somewhat regular basis for us here given the fact that where NOLA is trading.","I think it's one of those things that when the Middle Eastern producers wake up and realize that they're basically leaving $20 per ton on the table, they'll start changing those things but it's probably going to take a couple years for it to fully work itself out. Those things will come up for renegotiation. And when they do, we'd expect them to get sorted in the most economic way possible.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joan Tong - Stephens, Inc.","Good morning. This is Joan Tong for Mark Connelly. Just staying with the export question or answers that you just talk about. Are your export capabilities from Donaldsonville fully up and running at this point? I'm just wondering if there are any limitations on what you can do with tonnage there or any sort of ramp in export capabilities beyond just finding the customers?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. We did over 2 million tons last year of exports coming out of Donaldsonville or close to 3 million, and we've got the ability to probably export as much as 7 million. On urea is right now the place where it makes probably the most sense because with NOLA trading at a discount and it being kind of the same cost to get product up into the Midwest as it is to get it to areas in Latin America or other places around the world, we have the opportunity to get a little bit of additional cash by exporting.","UAN, because it tends to not be used quite as widely as urea is and you're shipping a lot of water, while we've done a lot of UAN exports and continue to look at it, the opportunities there are not quite as easily achievable, but Bert and his team have done a great job of establishing relationships in Europe and also in Latin America on the UAN front. So, it gives us a lot of optionality. Bert, you want to?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","No, that's it. We're netback driven. And as we can make profitable decisions for the company, we will export as much as necessary. We like the opportunities. We like the relationships we developed and like the flexibility it gives to the company. So, we'll keep doing it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Alexandre Falcao with HSBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alexandre Pfrimer Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Thanks for the question. With respect of not having any further delays or second quarter picking up the \u2013 just like for the first quarter, the England contract and the surge in oil prices, when do you think you guys are going to be able to reassess your guidance for the year? It seems like if weather is not really going to affect your numbers, it seems like it's \u2013 the outlook is more positive than we \u2013 when you provided the guidance. Is that a fair assumption?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, we don't \u2013 we try not to give \u2013 point estimate numbers or even tight ranges because this business is pretty volatile and subject to weather and other vagaries. And so our position is to try to discuss what the major factors are that are driving it, so gas cost in North America, energy costs elsewhere, kind of where nitrogen is trading, and kind of what we think the demand profile is, and then use that as a way to provide kind of directional information, which Dennis did. It's consistent with where we were the last time we were on a call which was after the fourth quarter results. And so I don't know, when you say update our guidance, I wouldn't expect to update it in a different direction.","And if were \u2013 as long as we're providing directional information, I think it's going to be pretty consistent. You'll likely hear the same thing from us in the next call. But we're not going to go to providing specific numbers or ranges. That's a level of precision that we just don't have in this industry given the volatility.","Alexandre Pfrimer Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. But you would say that when you first provided those views, is that a more favorable environment than it was before?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I mean, I think when we said that before, I don't know that gas has changed that dramatically versus where we were. And I think pricing is moderated a little bit but not a lot and demand has been delayed out of the first quarter into the second. But again, we expect to continue to move all of the tons that we produce. So, I don't know that there has been a substantive change in our outlook.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question in queue comes from the line of John Roberts with the UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Yes. Thank you. Do you have any thoughts on China's corn ethanol plant? I've been skeptical, but I've seen some recent refinery consultant presentations that say China is going forward with E10. But from a corn balance perspective, it's seems pretty hard to envision.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","When you look at \u2013 yes, we have looked at that and that would be an exciting change because then the imports of corn would go up and that would satisfy the need to move Brazilian as well as our excess corn to a new demand center. There is construction taking place or plans for additional ethanol production. We've heard about this mythical corn stock that is an aged stock of corn in China and that it's probably not or has degraded some, and probably ethanol would be the best next use of that corn. And so the scale and the size and the timing of the exact construction of these assets I'm not aware but the movement to ethanol as an oxygenate as part of their environmental cleanup makes sense. And they would have dual supply not only out of Brazil I think for their excess production as well as our own. So I think there's more to come on this story.","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, presenters, I am showing no additional questions in \u2013 as I say that there, we have one additional question that just came into the queue, comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Looking at the very last slide in your deck on the Chinese closures, and it seems like that slide hasn't been updated in a while. Not implying that you guys haven't been working on it, I'm just saying that most of those closures on there are from 2017 \u2013 or most in fact, 2016 or early 2017. But we've heard a lot of closures in 2018, particular winter, we'd expect more. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing right now in China and how you \u2013 well, is there incremental to the slide that you have in your deck?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, Jonas that was the point that I made earlier which was we don't tend to put that stuff in our slides until we can convince ourselves that those things are actually permanently closed down. Okay? And so that may be the delay you're seeing in just our process.","But what we are seeing in China today from an overall dynamic perspective is we are seeing more aggressive enforcement, we are seeing increased regulation and reductions in subsidies and the like, and higher coal prices. And also in addition to that, an exchange rate that's gone the wrong way on the Chinese versus where perhaps people would've thought it was going to go a year and a half, two years ago. So all those dynamics point in the direction of additional closures through time. But again, our process is such that we're only going to count that as a closure once we can get ourselves comfortable that it's confirmed actually really closed.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have an additional follow-up from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, hi, another question on this China shutdowns and exports. Exports declined, I think you said 77%. And clearly, appreciate that China has been shutting down capacity among this pollution control issues. But in some other industries, where China had shutdown capacity, the producers are getting in over there, they're relocating plants, installing for pollution control equipment and to bring some capacity back. Now, again, this may not happen right away, but looking forward do you think there's risk in urea of that?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I don't see that same dynamic playing out in urea. Part of it is because there is a pretty sizeable environmental footprint that happens outside of just the emissions coming out of the urea plant itself from an air quality perspective. There's, it's a pretty sizeable water user and you've got all of the particular matter and other emissions coming out of the mines as well. And there's been a big push by the central government to get rid of the zombie industries and leave healthy, profitable, smaller industries behind and that's been particularly true within the coal sector.","And so when you look at effectively producing excess urea in order to export it at a net loss relative to what their cost structure looks like when it takes a high environmental toll, when what you're effectively doing is exporting energy and then importing in the form of urea from coal production and then importing LNG at $10-plus on top of it. That's a pretty negative arbitrage. And we just don't see that happening. It's not like it's affecting their self-sustainability in terms of food production. And again, it's taken a pretty heavy environmental toll. So when you rack all of that together, we just don't think that there's going to be this big slug of Chinese capacity that comes back on the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Terry Huch, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Please proceed, sir.","Terrell D. Huch","Thank you. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I am Terry Huch, the Head of Investor Relations, and with me are Steve Wilson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Tony Will, our Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its fourth quarter and full year 2011 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen Company LP. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by Federal securities laws.

Consider all forward-looking statements in light of those and other risks and uncertainties, and do not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce you to Steve Wilson, our Chairman and CEO.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Terry, and welcome to all of you who are joining the call today. I'm sure you all saw the excellent results we published for the fourth quarter. Before we walk you through these results, I want to cover a couple of points. First, I want to recognize Terry, who as many of you already know is in the midst of a transition to a new, bigger assignment of directing all of our natural gas and sulfur purchasing. He has done a great job leading our IR efforts for the last 2.5 years and has set a high bar for his successor, who we hope to identify soon.","I'd also like to take a moment to reflect on what we accomplished in 2011. For the year, we had record production, sales volume, revenue, earnings, EPS and cash flow. In doing so, we've proved that we have solidified the platform that was created by acquiring and integrating Terra Industries. We demonstrated our proficiency in operating that greatly improved platform. And I believe our focus on execution allowed us to extract every advantage from it. ","In 2011, we improved in key areas that already were strengths, including revenue and margin optimization, production excellence, best practice sharing and safety. We thrive even in the toughest stretches of the year because of what I will call robustness synergies, meaning that our expanded scale and flexibility put us in the strongest competitive position when demand was delayed, when product mix changed and when transportation became difficult.","In 2011, we produced $3 billion of EBITDA, which is very gratifying because it equaled an internal goal the management team had discussed earlier in the year. Abundant cash flow has been allowing us to do everything we want to do simultaneously: improve the balance sheet, distribute cash to shareholders and invest in the growth of the business. During 2011, we retired the last of our acquisition-related term loans. We distributed over $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and reallocated funds for significant capital projects for both the near and long term. ","We completed a major expansion at our Woodward, Oklahoma nitrogen facility where we are now upgrading an additional 200,000 tons per year of ammonia to higher value UAN. We laid all the groundwork needed to start production a few months from now of a unique sulfur-enhanced phosphate product that our customers are very excited about. We approved and commenced a project to expand ammonia production at Donaldsonville, 500,000 tons per year. We announced that we had earmarked an additional $1 billion to $1.5 billion for other capital projects within our existing nitrogen complexes in North America. And we increased the number of plants producing Diesel Exhaust Fluid from 1 to 3, soon to be 4 and put in place the corresponding distribution infrastructure. ","So we had a great year, and we've positioned ourselves for a great future. Financial markets took note of that, rewarding our shareholders with total returns far in excess of market indices and our peers in 2011. Our primary focus will continue to be on delivering outstanding financial results safely and responsibly, which we believe will lead to the kind of returns that our owners expect.","Last night, CF Industries reported fourth quarter net earnings of $439 million or $6.66 per diluted share on sales of $1.7 billion, all fourth quarter records. We're very proud of these results, especially considering the decline we saw in market demand and prices during November and December. This gave us a chance to show that the lag in our average prices caused by forward selling does work in both directions. ","Despite the stiff declines in reported market prices, our average selling prices for ammonia, urea and UAN increased by 9% to 15% from the third quarter to the fourth. But there was more to our margin management than a simple lag. As we entered the fourth quarter, our order book for the period was relatively full with orders received when available margins were higher. Spot prices were disappointing in the second half of the quarter, but we didn't have much appetite for booking new business for most of our products at those price levels, and in any event, very little spot business was being transacted in the industry. ","Our confidence in the large planting of corn we expect this spring reinforced our position and made it easy to pass on some less attractive selling opportunities in both the spot and forward markets during the pricing trough, which occurred in mid-December. You can see evidence of our patience on our balance sheet. We were holding $878 million in customer advances on September 30, and that balance fell to $257 million by year end. I'll talk later about the favorable implications we expect the smaller book to have in the first half of 2012.","For the fourth quarter of 2011, it means that our prepay balance fell by more than $600 million, yet we still had operating cash flow of more than $100 million in that period. Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $871 million, a fourth quarter record. EBITDA, excluding mark-to-market adjustments, was a record for any quarter, surpassing the previous mark set just 6 months earlier. ","The fourth quarter also provided a nice illustration of the way in which lower North American natural gas prices have raised our floor margins, making our Nitrogen business very profitable even in weak periods. In mid-December, urea prices at the U.S. gulf bottomed at around $350 per short ton, which we believe based on our observations, roughly corresponds to the landed cash costs of the highest cost producers. ","At this theoretical floor price, our cash margin for production and sale of urea at New Orleans was above 60%. If that's as bad as it gets in a period of collapsing demand, then shares of North American nitrogen producers wouldn't seem to deserve much of a multiple discount due to industry volatility. Although demand's lacking for many of our products in the fourth quarter, there were some bright spots. We participated in a very good fall ammonia application season, which allowed us to sell 874,000 tons at an average price of $633 during the quarter. ","As was the case with the other products, our average price realization for ammonia compared very favorably to benchmarks because much of it had been sold forward in prior periods. Total ammonia sales volume in the quarter was about 5% lower than last year, but the agricultural volume was about the same. Mild weather throughout the growing region allowed application to continue throughout December and even January in some areas. Our team did a great job of delivering the product where it was needed throughout the season. Although inventory levels are low, we were able to meet our customers' needs across our system.","As soft was the mild weather was for fertilizer application, it was just as great a boom for natural gas costs. The average daily market price in Henry Hub was $3.31 per MMBtu, which sounds high now but was 20% lower than the average in the prior quarter. We priced a lot of the gas we consumed in the fourth quarter when we accepted forward orders prior to the beginning of the quarter, which accounts for most of the difference between the average fourth quarter hub price and our average cost of $4.06 per MMBtu. ","Our phosphate operations had a good fourth quarter too. We exported a large area of our DAP and MAP volume during the first quarter. The rapid pace of exports continued last month with export net backs at a premium compared to domestic sales. Our average, phosphate price realizations in Q4 were up sequentially and 18% higher year-over-year. ","For the year, the Phosphate segment had sales of $1.1 billion and an average price realization of $565 per ton. Both were second highest in our history, exceeded only by 2008 when we posted phosphate sales of $1.3 billion with an average price realization of $760 per DAP. ","The Nitrogen segment rewrote the record book in our first full year after the Terra acquisition, achieving sales of $5 billion and gross margin of $2.6 billion. Average nitrogen price realizations were very similar to 2008 levels but with 51% gross margins compared to 30% in 2008 when our average gas cost was more than double what we experienced in 2011. ","Whereas 2008 represented a short-term spike in commodity prices, 2011 was a year of more gradual and sustainable increases supported by strong demand, favorable supply dynamics and much higher input costs for swing producers in Eastern Europe and China. Before I turn the call over to Dennis for a few more comments on our financial performance, I'd like to salute our entire CF Industries team. The market did provide a great opportunity in 2011, but it took a great team effort to achieve what I believe were stellar results. It was a pleasure to watch our fully integrated team execute our strategy last year. Dennis?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Steve. For the full year 2011, CF Industries had net earnings of $1.5 billion on sales of $6.1 billion. Fully diluted earnings per share of $21.98 included noncash mark-to-market losses on natural gas derivatives, the impairment of methanol assets in Woodward, gains on the sale of noncore assets, restructuring integration and other business combination costs and a small amount of Peru project development costs. Together, these items reduced EPS by $0.91 for the year. ","EBITDA for 2011 was about $3 billion. To put that in historical context, the company's sales didn't reach $3 billion until 2008. The items affecting earnings that I just mentioned excluding a portion of business combination costs that was recorded in interest expense reduced 2011 EBITDA by $83 million as shown on Slide 8. ","Our fourth quarter net income of $439 million or $6.66 per share included mark-to-market adjustments of $49.7 million before taxes or $0.47 per share after tax. This represents the adjustment required to bring natural gas derivatives that will mature in future quarters to their fair market value based on the gas strip as of December 31. ","Our fully diluted EPS was a fourth quarter record as illustrated by the red box bars on Slide 5. Before mark-to-market adjustments, EPS was a record for any quarter in the company's history although net earnings were not. Due to our share repurchases, EPS had the added benefit of a significantly reduced share count compared to the second quarter of 2011 when we set the prior records. ","Our Nitrogen business performed very well in the fourth quarter. As shown on Slide 6, we had nitrogen sales of $1.5 billion, up $461 million from the fourth quarter of 2010 on about the same volume. Segment gross margin of $786 million was 54% of sales, 12 percentage points higher than in the fourth quarter of 2010, due to higher prices and lower natural gas costs. ","Our average ammonia and urea price realizations were up 40% year-over-year, and average UAN realizations were up 72%. The nitrogen segment had sales volume of 3.3 million tons in the fourth quarter. An increase in UAN volume offset small declines in other products. For ammonia, the year-over-year reduction in fourth quarter industrial sales was about equal to the amount of net ammonia capacity that was consumed by the Woodward UAN expansion. Agricultural ammonia sales were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, but both quarters were very good application seasons due to strong demand and favorable weather conditions.","January urea sales volume was slightly lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010, but our average realized sales price of $465 per short ton was a great result. That compared to $331 in the fourth quarter of last year. We sold 1.6 million tons of UAN in the fourth quarter at an average price of $354 per ton. That represented increases of 139,000 tons and $148 per ton compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. The volume increase essentially corresponded to the amount of quarterly production capacity we added earlier in the year. For the full year, the Nitrogen segment had gross margin of $2.6 billion compared to $1 billion in the prior year. 2011 marked the first time the company has ever shipped 13 million tons of nitrogen products in a year.","The Phosphate business also performed well, which you can see on Slide 7. We achieved a 31% gross margin on sales of $255 million. Sales volume of 439,000 tons was 38,000 tons lower than in the fourth quarter of 2010, but the combined average selling price for the phosphate was 18% higher. Exports comprised 45% of our phosphate sales in the quarter, which is a little higher than average. We continue to have a conservative balance sheet with ample liquidity. ","I know that investors have been very interested to learn more about the progress of our share repurchase program. In 2011, we spent $1 billion to repurchase common shares, which was the maximum amount allowed under the restricted payments basket in our revolving credit facility. With this report of our results for the year, the basket gets replenished, allowing us to resume the repurchases at our discretion. ","Many of you have asked us what our cash deployment intentions are beyond the share repurchase and investment initiatives that we announced in August last year. To the extent we have available cash for additional forecasted cash flow, we'll go through the same disciplined process that was used last summer to determine the best way to employ capital to maximize shareholder value. We are pleased, of course, to be faced with this issue only 6 months after announcing actions totaling $2.5 billion to $3 billion. ","In 2011, we had capital expenditures of just less than $250 million. This was below our average pace of $300 million across the turnaround cycle. For 2012, we are projecting CapEx of $400 million, reflecting higher expenditures for plant turnarounds and some spending for the Donaldsonville ammonia debottlenecking project. The other expansion projects we announced in August should be ready for decisions in the second half of the year, but 2012 capital expenditures on these projects should be minimal. ","Now with that, let me turn it back to Steve to discuss the outlook.","Stephen R. Wilson","Thanks, Dennis. I've given many favorable outlooks in a row on our quarterly calls, and I'm happy to say that our track record over that period has been pretty good. I know there's a lot of uncertainty out there now, which has been evident in the timing of fertilizer purchases and in market volume expectations for P&K. ","Like others in the industry, we're somewhat cautious about demand levels for phosphate this spring, and we've acted on that sentiment by accelerating the timing of plant turnarounds for portions of our phosphate operations in Florida. In contrast, we expect strong demand for nitrogen in the spring. The USDA's current season average forecast for the farm price of corn is the highest ever for this time of year. And the projected stocks-to-use ratio at the end of this marketing year is the second lowest in 40 years. ","We expect farmers to plant a large number of acres to corn, quite possibly an all-time record and applying near optimal amounts of nitrogen fertilizer if weather conditions are right. Investors don't need to watch daily changes in the spot price of corn to forecast what kind of a spring the nitrogen industry is likely to have. We don't believe a moderate change in the current spot price of corn will change planting and fertilization intentions at all or have a meaningful impact on the grower's ability to pay for crop inputs. ","We continue to forecast planting of 93.5 million acres of corn in 2012. Whether the actual number is a little higher or a little lower, the quantity of nitrogen fertilizer demanded should be near-record levels. We already have a good jump on nitrogen fertilization this year with the favorable conditions for applying ammonia. In fact, it was hard to tell when the fall season ended and the spring season began this year. ","Extremely mild weather made it possible for growers to apply ammonia in January in many parts of the Midwest, with particularly strong pull in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Nebraska. We're also seeing a rush to fertilize winter wheat in Texas and Oklahoma, where precipitation came late. As a result, ammonia volume and business mix should be favorable in the first quarter. ","Although ammonia may garner a slightly larger share of nitrogen product mix this fertilizer year, investors should not be concerned that this will be problematic for us. Spring of 2011 showed that with acceptable weather conditions, we can have a very good demand for all nitrogen products in the year when more than 90 million acres of corn are planted. Our order book on December 31 was smaller than it was a quarter ago or a year ago. That's not a concern for us either. We believe that demand will be there, and our volumes will be strong if weather cooperates. Because purchasing decisions are late this year, we expect that some areas will experience a buying rush in the last 2 months, and suppliers with product available for spot sales may be rewarded.","Our raw material cost continued to be a strong tailwind for us. Phosphate production cost will benefit from the recent fall in Tampa ammonia prices, which are rather loosely correlated with corn belt ammonia prices. Domestic phosphate producers also settled sulfur negotiations recently and secured a 22% decrease in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. And, of course, the recent drop in natural gas prices will benefit our Nitrogen business over time. Recent spot in the front month prices for gas at Henry Hub have fallen to a range of around $2.50 per MMBtu because of production growth and very warm weather. As a result, the U.S. has built a storage surplus of between 600 and 700 Bcf in the lower 48 states compared to the last year and the 5-year average. Rig counts have been falling, but they have to fall further to stop the growth in production. To reverse that growth, we believe well shut-ins would be required. As a result, we don't expect much strength in gas prices this year.","Our press release indicated that as of December 31, we had fixed the price of nearly 2\/3 of the gas we expect to use in production in 2012. Had we known that this would be the winter that never arrived, we wouldn't have been quite so aggressive. But forecasting the weather isn't something we claim as an area of expertise, in fact, I'm not sure it's anyone's area of expertise. What I know is that we saw an opportunity to fix our cash cost of urea production below $150 per ton, which is a level at which we can earn very attractive margins. To wrap up, we expect 2012 to be a great year. We expect a potential record planting of corn, and we believe strongly that it will translate into very good demand for nitrogen.","If we experience periods of lower demand, our margins will be supported by better floor price economics than in the past and very favorable feedstock cost. Together, these factors provide more evidence that nitrogen industry results will be characterized by higher highs and higher lows going forward. ","With that, let's open the call to your questions. Chantale, please explain the Q&A procedure.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Elaine Yip of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Elaine Yip - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So a quick question on your natural gas hedges. Can you give us a sense as to perhaps what price you might have walked in on average and how the hedges are spread over the course of the year?","Stephen R. Wilson","I'll give you a bit of perspective on our process, and I'd like to put what we did in a bit of a longer-term context. First of all, we noted that we fixed about 2\/3 of our gas for 2012. That means that we're roughly 1\/3 exposed to the spot market at this point for 2012. And of course, we're fully exposed to future gas prices for 2013 and beyond. What we did in the late fourth quarter really shouldn't be a surprise to the people who've been conversing with us over the last couple of years. We indicated that we hadn't had an appetite to lock in fixed gas beyond our fertilizer sales commitments, but that we might become interested if strip got below say $4, that we -- that had a free handle on it. So when that happened in around mid-December, we convened our natural gas committee. They made a recommendation for a program, which we executed over a several week curve following that series of meetings. We're very comfortable with what we did. We're never going to be perfect here. I'd like to remind everybody that urea is a product that recently has sold in the range of $350 to $450 a ton and higher than that in the past, and to have an opportunity to fix our cost at below $150 a ton was a great opportunity. Part of our decision process, of course, is based upon our past experiences, bad things happen in this business. Out winters get cold and so we were protecting ourselves against the adverse weather events. From a much longer-term perspective, I'd like actually to remind you of how we manage our margin. We've talked a lot over the years about our Forward Pricing Program, how we make decisions about forward prices, how long our forward commitments are, and we've had lots of discussions about the fact that our focus isn't on the absolute price, it's on the margin. And we're looking to achieve the highest possible margin on a sustained bases. Turning the coin over and looking at that gas side, our view is exactly the same, and that is that our focus is on the margin by having our cost structure pretty well fixed. It gives us the opportunity to exploit what we hope and expect will be a firming of prices on the nitrogen side. So over the last period of time, I think we've demonstrated really good discipline in what we do. This is the kind of process that led us to post $3 billion of EBITDA in 2011 on $6 billion of sales. So I feel really good about what we did and where we stand going forward.","Elaine Yip - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But, I mean, I guess in thinking about what cost you might have locked in 2012 that the long-term strategy certainly makes a lot of sense, but how should we think about the hedges in place? Is it more weighted towards first half, second half? What is maybe the relative price or what time? At what point in 4Q did you decide to put the hedges on?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, we looked at this in around midmonth, and we're looking at the strip at that point. And in terms of the spread throughout the year, there's not much variation throughout the year.","Elaine Yip - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then can you comment on your nitrogen production capability for 2012? You obviously ran at exceptionally high rates in 2011. Can that really be sustained this year? What type of turnarounds might you have scheduled throughout the year?","Stephen R. Wilson","Tony Will will comment on that, Elaine.","W. Anthony Will","Elaine, by any measure, 2011 was a terrific year for us in the production side, as well as for the whole company. We had fewer turnarounds than in '11 and usual, and we also had less unscheduled downtime than a historically normalized year as well. And that resulted in production records across the company. So as we look forward into 2012, we have more turnaround scheduled than in '11 and an assumption that the unscheduled downtime will also return to something that may be more reflective of a normal pattern. And the result of that is that we're expecting for our production volume this year to be a bit lower than where we were in 2011.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. I was just wondering if we could talk a little bit more about your order book. When I see your balance sheet and customer advance is down 40% year-over-year, is that sort of a good way to think about sort of how the order book stacks up compared to a typical year? And are there any specific products which might be a little bit weaker than others?","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","I think how we would look at it is every year is different, every season is different. And our order book, as Steve mentioned, trended lower into the first quarter. So with 93 million acres or 94 million, whatever the estimate is, which would be a 2 million to 3 million-acre increase over what was planted in the spring of 2011, we're very positive what will take place and the need for farmers to purchase nitrogen. So while the book might have been a little bit lower than normal coming into the first quarter, we're anticipating robust activity from this point forward, and we've already seen some activity during the first 2 weeks of February.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just one other follow-up. Can you update us a little bit on your plans for Peru? I saw a recent report that the government may have set a deadline for your project there, so I just wanted to get an update.","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, Dan, I really have no update. We have been sort of sitting on the sidelines waiting to see whether some roadblocks got broken. They haven't been broken thus far. That particular report was not factually correct. But the substance of my response is that we haven't made any progress there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could clarify the terms of the credit agreement a little bit in 2 ways. One, what do you now have available in terms of the amount of share repurchases for 2012, is it $500 million, is it $1 billion? [indiscernible] I know what's left in the program. And two, why not renegotiate that agreement or get a new one to give yourself complete flexibility to take advantage of things like your $130 share price at some point in December or the 10% down day on the Ukrainian gas concerns in November? And then thirdly, with the gas costs fixed now, does that give you more confidence or more comfort in maybe executing incremental or larger share repurchases than what's left in the authorization?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Vincent, this is Dennis. I'll respond to your question. I want to just sort of put my response on the context with sort of what's happened over the past several months. In August, we announced with respect to shareholders sort of 2 initiatives. One was to increase our dividend to $0.40 per share per quarter, which we've done, and that's happened, that's delivered. And in addition to that, we announced that we had authorization from our board to repurchase shares up to $1.5 billion, and that authorization runs through the end of 2013. And we've completed 2\/3 of that before 2011 had even ended. And we were able to buy those shares back at $153 a share on average, $153.50 I think, which is well below today's price and certainly very well below our time all-time high share price, as you know. As we think about the future, what I can say about that is what I've said in the speech itself and going forward, and that is we're going to take the same disciplined approach to looking at additional share repurchases in the future as we have in the past. Since those seem to make the most sense in terms of delivering value to the shareholders, then we'll certainly do that. As we said in the speech, with this report, our basket has been replenished, and we're capable of moving forward and resuming share prices when we choose to do so consistent with the authorization that we have. With respect to the credit agreement, what I'd say about that going forward is we have not amended that in the fourth quarter last year because we really don't want to tinker with that at the margins. To the degree that we want to do something different there, and I'm not saying that we will but to the degree we want to do something different there, we would do something much more comprehensive than simply amending this particular part of the agreement or that particular part of the agreement. But I really don't have anything on that to say today.","Stephen R. Wilson","Vincent, this is Steve. I'll just add a couple thoughts. One is that the basket that we have available now is bigger than what we would need to complete the program that's in place. And with respect to the last part of your question, which I believe related to does our large amount of fixed-price gas give us a greater ability to do share repurchases. My answer to that is that our gas hedging activity is really a tactical move designed to change our risk profile in managing our margins going forward. And it doesn't really impact our longer-term view on the cash generation capability of the company or what we might or might not do with that cash.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. If I could just ask a follow-up. Could you talk a little bit specifically about the UAN market? Prices have come down sort of precipitously in the last few weeks, and there's been some chatter in the trade about one of your competitors being more aggressive with selling product in the fourth quarter than it sounds like you were and just how you're thinking about your position there as we go into the spring.","Stephen R. Wilson","Bert?","Bert A. Frost","We're pleased with our position. The UAN market has been volatile. As you can see from our pricing coming off the fourth quarter at $3.54, we captured exceptional pricing. And you're correct. At the end of the fourth quarter, pricing did come off. A reflection of several issues, you see from the import statistics, a large volume on a 5-year average and even on a year-on-year average were much higher than anticipated. And I think some areas probably on the East Coast where the import tanks were full, that shifted some of the import material into other markets. That, coupled with delays in purchasing, whether that be prepaid that comes in, in December, generally or retailer, wholesaler delays in purchasing during that period, probably pushed a few producers to become more aggressive. But again, last year, when you look at what happened on ammonia and UAN and for the spring of 2011, we had an exceptional fall, an exceptional spring on ammonia and an exceptional summer or spring to summer application of UAN. We're anticipating similar movement this year, and that's the benefit of where we are at CF with our interior tanks in production and our logistical capabilities. We believe will be able to capture the market when it does come, and it has started to come. The urea price, as you know, have moved in NOLA recently and that should on end basis, push UAN to a similar level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Steve, in your release, you had indicated that ammonia volumes were pretty well depleted in January for yourselves, as well as I think, some of your competitors. Can you talk about implications for volumes in the first quarter? Is it your sense that it's getting pulled forward from the second quarter into the first as a result of the favorable weather?","Stephen R. Wilson","Kevin, just -- I'll make a general comment, and Bert will follow if he has anything to add. We are very pleased to have the ammonia run that we had this fall. It helped us display the strength of our system, which is a fully integrated system from plant to basically to the truck heading off to the retailer or to the farm. And because of the length of the season, we were able to augment the volumes that were in our tanks before the season started and continue to run. And that's a credit to our supply chain people and the coordination that exists from the plant to the supply chain to the sales organization. Having said all of that, we have product to sell, and we'll be ready to go for the spring. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","I think the only thing to add is how -- what doesn't -- is not seen is our ability to transition between products in production, whether that be if ammonia is strong, we have the ability to go full ammonia, full UAN or in Donaldsonville, Courtright and Medicine Hat, we have the ability obviously to produce urea. And so those plants that are dual or triple capability were moving between products as the market demands.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then a couple of follow-ups if I may on natural gas. Steve, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on the outlook for gas costs over in the Ukraine at the high end of the cost curve in 2012. And then second, just as a clarification, am I correct in understanding that you did not put in any additional hedges in the first quarter to date such that you're still at a 65% hedge ratio as of today?","Stephen R. Wilson","The answer to your last question is we haven't had significant activity since the end of the year. With respect to what's going on in Ukraine, I guess my understanding is that there's no news out of the Ukraine since the rumors that came out a couple of months ago and caused a little bit of scare in the marketplace that there was a gas deal on the horizon that was going to be put in place. It hasn't been announced. And so as far as we know, those producers today are hanging there in the range of $7.50 MMBtu for the gas or higher -- and higher in some cases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez of Lazard Capital Markets.","Edlain Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So just quickly, so just to clarify, so now we're having less forward sales, does that mean your realized prices will be much closer to spot going forward in 2012?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, for that portion of our business that is not already booked, we have the opportunity to capture prices at the spot level.","Edlain Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on natural gas again at $250 right now, why not hedge more in terms of for post 2012, let's say for 2013 and so forth? I mean, what's keeping you from being more aggressive post 2012?","Stephen R. Wilson","A flippant answer would be if we do that, we leave ourselves susceptible to being questioned about why we're not in the spot market when it's $1.50. But that is just a flippant answer. We look at our gas positions on a regular basis. I'd never say never. But there's a lot of gas out there, and there aren't signs of a deep freeze coming before the winter is over. So perhaps, there is as much opportunity -- there's additional opportunity in front of us.","Edlain Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, given everything you've seen in the market right now and the expectation for the spring, like how confident are you that prices will firm up as we get closer to the spring planting season?","Bert A. Frost","I don't want to make a call -- this Bert -- on where prices will be, but you have seen from the lows of December of $350 for urea, today we're at $430 for March and April and expect further strength. UAN will follow behind. Midwest ammonia has stayed strong, you can see that in Green Markets. And again, going back to demand and the need for nitrogen, especially on the corn on corn acres, we believe that the farmer's incentive to apply the maximum or the ideal amount of nitrogen fertilizers will be met, and we will have the inventory in place, and we do expect spot outages. As these delays have taken place on the purchasing side, that limits the logistical capabilities of the overall market, and that's where again, we believe our strengths lie because of our debt strength and assets in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly of CLSA.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Kurt Schoen in for Mark. With more DAP and MAP going to the export market over the past year, do you expect this trend to continue going forward? And secondly, where do you see the greatest phosphate growth opportunities internationally for CF?","Stephen R. Wilson","Well, in terms of our mix of import and export, we don't have a target in mind. We look for the best net backs we can get. I think our location in Florida coupled with our relative size gives us an opportunity to take advantage of pockets of demand where they develop. And in some cases, these are smaller pieces of demand than some other people are interested in taking. We're happy to take that business if it provides a good net back. But we don't have objectives here. We watch the market daily. Our partners at KEYTRADE help us do that. And we look at our margins, not at where it goes. With respect to future market development, Bert, you want to comment on that?","Bert A. Frost","I think it goes back to your comment on KEYTRADE and the partnership that we have there that's very strong and the relationships that are in place around the world. We're on the phone or visiting the major markets on a regular basis, that being South America specifically, Brazil. We did move some tons into India, you saw that in the fourth quarter and then other opportunities as they come up whatever continent that -- where that may be. We do have, as mentioned earlier, the new product coming online in 2012, the sulfur MAP. We're excited about that and have a high level of demand or anticipation for that product when it is available.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Great. And with India's reduction of their subsidy or their planned reduction, how do you view that affecting that market for DAP and MAP?","Bert A. Frost","Well, it's interesting because the statistics are out and obviously we're watching India because it's such a big weight on the phosphate, the world phosphate market. And with the decrease -- they're projecting a 20% decrease in DAP, but you have a consummate corresponding increase in the N-P-K. So the nutrients, and I don't have that on the exact level, were pulled, but we are watching the subsidy level, and if that can have an impact on demand, but the need there is stark. The need for yields, and yields will only be achieved through N-P-K. And each of us in our respective areas -- obviously we're focused a little more on nitrogen but phosphate is important, and our colleagues that do phosphate and potash, we believe that, that -- that India will have to, whether it's through subsidies or market-based mechanisms, have an increasing demand and requirement for nutrients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann of Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on Vincent's question on your buyback capability. So is it fair to say that without changing the revolving credit line that you guys would be capped again at $1 billion of repurchases this year?","Dennis P. Kelleher","What I'd say is that if you look at the -- we've replenished the basket. We have authorization to do $500 million, Lindsay, for the balance of the authorization period ended 2013. We're in a position where we, if we wanted to or if it makes sense to do so, we're in a position to complete the authorization if we have to in 2012.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess there's 2 pieces. It's whether or not you would put out another authorization to buy back more stock and whether your revolving -- whether the credit agreement would limit -- it doesn't necessarily matter what you authorize if your credit agreement prevents you from actually pulling the trigger on those repurchases. So how do we think about -- the authorization part is straightforward, how do we think about how your credit agreement might cap you from further share repurchases this year unless it's reauthorized -- or unless it's amended?","Stephen R. Wilson","Lindsay, let me -- I'm going to reiterate Dennis' earlier comment and then add to it. As we go forward, assuming that we continue to generate cash the way we have been generating cash and the way we expect to generate cash, we're going to be faced with this wonderful question again about what to do with the cash. And we'll go through the same kind of process that we went through before in terms of coming to conclusions about deployment of cash. And at those points, at that point or those points in time, when we want to take actions, we will do whatever's necessary in our own infrastructure to enable ourselves to do that.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe moving on to market dynamics. So we have seen some nice pick up in urea and yet some continued stagnation at the price levels for UAN. Can you help us understand what -- whether there is demand substitution and where it might be between urea and solution and then also, how much swing production capability that you guys have not between UAN and ammonia, but whether there's any between UAN and urea and how much that exists in the broader industry?","Bert A. Frost","Regarding product substitution, that is a constant question and the farmer preference for what product he will apply on what crop. And there is obviously the 4Rs that we market and adhere to which are pushed by the Fertilizer Institute and -- but in certain areas and specific on the top dress of urea, which is where we saw movement during January and February, it was both. But it was definitely favored towards UAN. UAN is a great product. You can apply it with your chemicals. You have different variable rates. And so we're seeing growth in that and you can see it in the statistics with the growth in consumption of UAN, along with the acreage growth. But that is more tied to corn and corn being a heavy user of nitrogen. We talk a lot about this in the industry, and we still see consistent ammonia consumption in a range and urea and UAN also. So I don't -- all we -- I don't see much, again that you're in a range of value of N, I don't see a lot of substitution taking place. And what we'll see, what we anticipate seeing is a recovery of UAN as to rather than trading at a discount to urea, it will trade at parity or even an increase. Regarding the other issue of -- Tony, you want to take the production?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. Lindsay, on the production side, primarily at Donaldsonville we've got flexibility to move back and forth between more granulation of urea and cutting back on UAN. And that is an analysis that we look at in terms of margin per unit of nitrogen on an ongoing and continuous basis and can dial up and dial back on the fly as we go. And we've been running max urea granulation for quite a while now, and we'll continue to do so.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","As you think about the -- you talk about 93 million, 94 million acres of corn, in some places, you're even looking for 95 million, how do you think about the end and with the end demand, demands for UAN solutions should be in the first half of the year relative to the supply that we're already providing in the U.S. plus the new imports from Trinidad that we're seeing having an impact on the market. I guess I'm just wondering, it seems like demand's going to be good, but if supply is kind of crowding out the high-cost producers, why do we have hope that UAN prices start to improve from depressed levels?","Bert A. Frost","So when you look at the world market on a capacity basis, strict capacity basis, UAN is adequately supplied. However, you do have to move that product on a timely basis at the moment of consumption. And UAN is consumed in a narrow book-ended 3-month range of time. And so it's not that those capacities nor those quantities are available at all periods. And so yes, there has been a higher level of imports. And yes, the market has traded at a discount. But at let's say 13 million, 14 million tons of demand for UAN over again, a 3- to 4-month period, we think we're in a very nice position to capture the demand, as well as the price appreciation and\/or the price that's available in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Picken of Cleveland.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I just wanted to delve into that Phosphate business a little bit more. You indicated you might move up some of your downtime, and I just wanted to get a sense for how much production you're planning on cutting and if your expectation is that demand in the U.S. for phosphate is going to be flat or down slightly this year.","Stephen R. Wilson","Tony, you want to talk about our physical activities?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. You bet. Michael, so we looked at the current market conditions and our upcoming maintenance requirements. And based on where margins are currently versus expectations about what may develop in the future, we decided to move some of our turnaround activities into Q1 that were originally planned for later in the year. And so this has the effect basically of moving production out of Q1 that we'll realize then in the back half of the year. And the net result of that was that our reduction in Q1 production is roughly in line with what other North American producers have announced.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","On a percentage basis, you mean?","W. Anthony Will","Yes.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Great. And then in terms of kind of where you see the demand for phosphate I mean in the U.S. and globally in 2012, I mean, do you see global phosphate demand being sort of flat with last year or do you think it's going to be up slightly or what are sort of your expectations in the U.S. and globally for phosphate demand?","Bert A. Frost","I think we're in a -- this is Bert. We're in an interesting time. Normally, the November to January period is slow. And for Tony's point, we anticipated that in the reflection of the market, did what we did. But we see a positive market going forward. Some of the other destination markets in the international side were long or have been longer with inventories, that being Brazil and then the India discussion that when they go to negotiation with the major suppliers, we'll be watching that. But the U.S. had a good fall application window. And I think there is adequate supply in the United States. But we're also seeing -- consummate with the other products, we're seeing a positive market for phosphates going forward and anticipate a rebound in the international activity, probably later in the first but into the second quarter.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Great. And then last question sort of just in terms of your expectations for Chinese exports this year for both urea and for phosphate.","Stephen R. Wilson","I think, in general, we see continuation of essentially the same program as last year. I think our expectation is maybe a little less urea exported than last year with respect to phosphate. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","I would say the same. I think the 4-month window and the tax structure that's in place is that the obviously, an evolving and changing dynamic to the market, but it's been very positive to the North American phosphate producers who participate in the international markets.","Operator","Your next question goes to the line of Charles Neivert of Dahlman Rose.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","A quick question. Maybe you can help me reconcile this. You said we had a pretty decent fall on application, nitrogen, the major nutrients going down. We've had an extended winter so to say or a lack of a winter which has allowed more product to go down. And now, but you're still telling me that come the spring, we're going to run into a problem because -- or potentially a problem because we're trying to squeeze a lot on late. But we've laid down a lot already. Does that really negate that possibility or at least reduce it substantially? I mean, I know there's still substantial product to go down, but we've already put down probably more than we usually do at this point in time. So do you think that squeeze that typically comes or might come in the spring can happen again?","Bert A. Frost","You have to define what we're putting down. The spring season for wheat normally takes place in late January and into February. And so that might have been pulled forward a couple weeks, but that's normal activity in Oklahoma and let's say Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas region. What we mentioned earlier regarding ammonia and to the upper Midwest was abnormal in January. But when you consider that there are 4.6 million to 5 million tons of direct application of ammonia applied per year and a narrow window of January, how much went down in those markets? More than normal, but still, we need a lot of nitrogen for the corn and other products. And I think as a person focused on agriculture, we're pleased with that because that allows producer farmers to anticipate and time their planting, which as you know in the last couple years, has been extended due to weather delays. So this is probably ideal for the United States.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","I guess the question is looking forward, how much still has to go down? Is that pretty much within the realm of normalcy? Obviously, weather is going to -- is always the issue when you go to put it down. But we're not looking for any excessively large amount that has to get placed down where we might run into a weather issue that might close that down a little bit. So we're in a normal range for delivery, and if the weather is even reasonably cooperative, we should be able to get that down, is that a reasonable assessment?","Bert A. Frost","3 million more acres conservatively, and you're adding acres in, I would consider, marginal areas that are going to need nitrogen. And so you have to add in the caveats and the additional points that still, a lot of product needs to go down. So I'm not -- I don't have an exact number for you. And when we report our Q1, you'll see the ammonia movement. But it's still very positive.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","No, that's okay. We're going to have a big year, it's just a matter of is there going to be enough of a squeeze to create the pop in pricing that might be in the market expectation currently.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Terry Huch for closing remarks.

My name is Grace, I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to the host for today, Mr. Dan Swenson, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Sir, please proceed.","Dan Swenson","Good morning, and thanks for joining us on this conference call for CF Industries Holdings, Inc. I'm Dan Swenson, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. And with me are Tony Will, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Dennis Kelleher, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bert Frost, our Senior Vice President of Sales, Distribution and Market Development; and Chris Bohn, our Vice President, Supply Chain, Gas and Logistics.","CF Industries Holdings, Inc. reported its third quarter 2014 results yesterday afternoon as did Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. On this call, we'll review the CF Industries' results in detail and discuss our outlook, referring to several of the slides that are posted on our website. At the end of the call, we'll host a question-and-answer session.","As you review the news releases posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at cfindustries.com and as you listen to this conference call, please recognize that they contain forward-looking statements as defined by federal securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in Slide 2 of this webcast presentation and from time to time in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These forward-looking statements are made as of today, and the company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Now let me introduce Tony Will, our President and CEO.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. CF Industries reported EBITDA of $338 million for the third quarter and adjusted EBITDA of over $1.4 billion for the first 9 months of 2014.","Revenues were $921 million for the quarter, with nitrogen sales volumes 3% higher year-over-year on a comparable basis. Our top line performance was solid, and we were pleased with both our volume and pricing for the quarter.","EBITDA results were lower than the prior year period due to a few distinct items. While Dennis will get into more specifics about these items, a primary factor was the higher cost of fiscal gas during the early summer of 2014. Those higher gas costs made their way through our income statement in the third quarter, along with losses we incurred on derivative positions that settled during the quarter. This combination resulted in gas costs that were $36 million higher than the year-ago period. Although there is period-to-period variability in our results, it is really the longer-term nature of this business, as measured over the full year, that is important.","Quarterly comparisons vary for many reasons, including weather impacts. Is the spring early or late? Is the ammonia application window Q1 or Q2? When does planting occur? And how does the crop mature? And among others, gas cost. A lot of analytic horsepower is spent on dissecting quarterly results and trying to define what those results suggest about the trends and health of the business and what that portends for the future. However, in this business, quarterly comparisons hold little insight. Our top line was solid, while period EBITDA was impacted by gas and other costs. Higher gas cost from early summer hold no bearing on where the market is today. In fact, November NYMEX gas settled at $3.73 per MMBtu. Although I'll ask Bert and Dennis to dive into the details of the quarter shortly, I want to spend a few moments to reflect on the big drivers of our business, those that affect full year results and also the longer-term outlook: One, demand for nitrogen; two, pricing dynamics; and three, cost structure.","The fundamental demand characteristics for nitrogen are strong. We estimate 90 million acres of corn will be planted in North America in 2015. Farmers have strong balance sheets and are generating solid cash flow based on high yields this year. As they look forward to 2015, corn provides a positive return over variable cost and also over soybeans.","Analysis from leading agricultural schools shows that U.S. farmers have the lowest delivered cost basis and the most attractive returns over variable cost of farmers anywhere in the world, including compared to Argentina, Brazil and the Ukraine. With U.S. farmers positioned at the low end of the corn production cost curve, we are confident in the long-term associated nitrogen demand in North America.","We also have confidence in the long-term pricing dynamics of nitrogen. Nitrogen is not an industry where product pricing can collapse overnight by the action of one company. It is also not an industry with large fixed cost structures and big shutdown and restart costs that beckon to producers to gut it out and keep running through times with negative margins. Instead, nitrogen is an economically rational industry, where direct feedstock costs are typically 70% or more of the cash cost of production. It is an industry where producers shut down when product prices are below cash costs as was the case recently in parts of Eastern Europe and China.","Nitrogen is an industry that adheres to a global cost curve, where product prices below cash cost of marginal producers are not sustainable. We have repeatedly tested the global cost curve over the past 2 years and found that it stands the test of time. So we are confident in pricing dynamics as well.","Although a severe and prolonged winter drove gas cost to the highest levels in recent years during the first half of 2014, North American gas producers were quick to respond. Gas production has increased over 3 Bcf per day compared to last year and gas storage levels are now on a comfortable zone given the increased rate of production. The NYMEX forward curve is priced near $4 per MMBtu through 2018, with no sight of a calendar $5 price until after 2026.","As a result, we are very confident in the long-term stable characteristics of our cost base. This access to low-priced natural gas continues to be a true differentiator and competitive advantage for CF Industries.","The persistent demand for nitrogen, the only non-discretionary nutrient, coupled with rational industry pricing dynamics and a significant structural cost advantage, provide a strong economic incentive to run our plants at full rates every single day, making every ton we can. While there will be quarterly variations based on short-term weather dynamics and our decisions about the timing of when we sell our inventory, over a longer wavelength perspective, like a full year, we will tend to sell every ton of product we make. And every ton of that cost-advantaged product generates a significant amount of cash.","Even with gas costs at recent highs through the first half of 2014 and product prices forcing some high-cost producers to curtail, we still generated 40% gross margins from our North American production system through the first 9 months of the year.","As a reminder of the annual cash generating ability of our business, please refer to Slide 5 in our presentation materials, which is a page that was taken directly from our June 2013 Investor Day presentation. This slide shows nitrogen cash operating earnings at various urea and natural gas prices. Although this slide is representative of our business in 2014, it will not be accurate beyond this year, as our 2015 results will reflect additional product volumes and the associated cash operating earnings as our new capacity expansion projects come on stream beginning next year. In the future, we will provide an updated slide like this one for 2017, the first full year of production for all of the new capacity.","Now let me turn the call over to Bert and Dennis to provide a deeper discussion of our operations during the quarter. Bert?","Bert A. Frost","Thanks, Tony. Global nitrogen markets trended well during the quarter. As we had expected earlier in the year, the U.S. and international markets moved toward parity, as both gas curtailments and further [ph] production constraints in a number of regions tightened supply. At the same time, robust ammonia shipments and inventory depletion in the U.S. and strong urea shipments to India and South America supported the market.","Ammonia prices strengthened during the quarter, showing tightness in the market. Corn Belt prices moved from $610 per short ton at the beginning to $650 at the end of the quarter. While we picked up some of the benefit of this move, we also had a significant amount of sales from our order book priced at the lower level seen in June and July, prior to when the outages tightened the market and caused the prices to increase.","A heavy volume of industrial sales also impacted our average pricing due to the Mosaic contract sales and the lower mix of ag sales that normally occur in the quarter.","Participating in the spot urea market continued to be a positive decision for us, as there was good demand in the Southern Plains for winter wheat and we sold urea for prompt delivery. Along with this domestic demand, prices at the U.S. Gulf were also supported by the international markets. These international prices were higher than a year ago due to purchasing activity in South America and India tender activity, in addition to the high level of global production outages.","Chinese producers suffered heavy losses during the second and third quarters, which drove them back -- to back out of contractual commitments in some urea sales from the second quarter. This demonstrates to us the move toward economically-driven decisions in the utilization of their production and their attempt to develop a solid price floor for urea.","For UAN, we had a healthy amount of sales from our large order book, and we chose to export some UAN in order to balance our system and continue to grow our international footprint. Our DES and other products saw good growth characteristics during the quarter as well.","We are looking forward to the fourth quarter and 2015. The economics for U.S. farmers for growing corn continue to be attractive and offer a premium over soybeans. With drought conditions in Brazil and the potential for late planting of their second-crop corn, concern is developing that corn production from that area of the world will be reduced, which will have the effect of increasing demand for U.S. corn in the international market. We see this showing up in corn prices, which are now on the rise from their harvest lows. With an expected 90 million of acres of corn to be planted, we should see healthy nitrogen demand through the first half of 2015.","That demand is clearly evident in ammonia movement and price in the northern tier in Western Canada. Weather has been conducive to applications, and ammonia has been moving out of our tanks at a rapid pace, such as at our Vanscoy Saskatchewan terminal, which set a new record for shipments in a single year. Ammonia prices of around $650 to $680 per short ton, as quoted in industry publications, is indicative of strong demand in those Northern areas.","One near-term item that we are mindful of is our tight inventory level and level of planned outages during the fourth quarter, along with our unplanned outage at Woodward. These will limit our production and tons available for sale such that excluding our deliveries from our Trinidad production to Mosaic, we are likely to have fourth quarter ammonia sales volume similar to last year.","Additionally, our unplanned outage at Woodward will result in lost production, which could have an impact of approximately $20 million of loss cash operating earnings during the fourth quarter. This is on top of the loss cash operating earnings around $27 million from the outage earlier in the year.","However, we are confident that healthy ammonia prices will support pricing on upgraded products, and with limited availability of ammonia, upgraded products such as urea and UAN are likely to experience higher demand once we move into 2015.","Now let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher","Thanks, Bert. Beginning this quarter, we have changed our segment reporting, moving from 2 segments, Nitrogen and Phosphate, to 4 Nitrogen Product segments: ammonia, urea, UAN and other, along with Phosphate. The Phosphate segment will continue to appear until there are no prior year results to be shown, but the separation of Nitrogen into 4 reporting segments demonstrate our focus on Nitrogen as our core business and our commitment to transparency to enable investors to better understand our operations.","In the third quarter, we generated $338 million of EBITDA on sales of $921 million. This compares to $478 million of EBITDA in 2013 or $450 million excluding the $28 million of gross profit in the Phosphate segment. As Tony discussed, although our top line performance was solid, EBITDA results were lower than the prior year period due to a few distinct items.","Our cost of goods sold was affected by both losses on natural gas collar transactions that settled during the quarter and the higher cost of natural gas that made its way through inventory and cost of goods sold. These dynamics of our natural gas cost bear closer denomination.","First, when our derivative positions settle, the realized gains or losses from those derivatives impact the cost of goods sold line immediately in the quarter in which that derivatives settle. Our third quarter 2014 cost of goods sold included a loss of $20 million on the natural gas collars that settled that quarter.","We entered into these collars during June and July when gas storage was low and gas prices, as indicated on Slide 11, were much higher due to the risk of a hot summer and associated peaks in power demand. The losses on the derivatives were due to the subsequent decline in gas prices by the time those hedges settled during the third quarter.","From a fundamental perspective, lower natural gas prices are a positive for our business. It is worth noting that on a 9-month year-to-date basis, we have realized net gains of $64 million on our settled gas derivative positions, as represented on Slide 11.","These significant gains provide evidence of the beneficial impact of our hedging programs in reducing volatility in gas pricing, especially during winter months.","Second, the cost of the physical gas we use to produce nitrogen moves into inventory when we purchase the gas, as indicated on Slide 10. It is only when we sell that inventory that the cost of that gas then flows through to cost of goods sold. Because of how much ammonia inventory we hold at times of the year and because of the seasonal nature of when we sell agricultural ammonia, the physical cost of natural gas purchased in 1 quarter can show up in cost of goods sold in later quarters.","As we look at the third quarter, the ammonia we sold during the quarter was generally produced in the June, July time frame. As you look at the Henry Hub first of month settlement prices graphed on Slide 10, you can see that gas was priced on average around the $4.50 level across the period. Those prices are more indicative of the cost of goods sold for the physical gas that flowed through our income statement during the quarter than were the Henry Hub average market prices within the quarter.","During the quarter, we also recorded approximately $24 million in expenses for certain other items. These items included higher storage costs. Previously, these costs were inventories and appeared in the cost of goods sold when the tons were sold. We now expense these costs when incurred. This changes an item that negatively affects the third quarter and will not impact future quarters. The other items also included incrementally lower margins due to a mix of sales from purchase product versus manufactured product and pension benefits settlement charges that occurred during the quarter.","Other operating expenses were impacted by a swing from a $22 million gain on foreign currency derivatives to a loss of $27 million due to the dollar strengthening against the euro. This impact to earnings is offset by the stronger purchasing power we have in buying euro-denominated equipment and engineering services for the expansion projects.","The projects are progressing well as construction activity remained on time and in line with budget expectations. You can see from the pictures in our earnings materials that a significant number of vessels have been set in place at Donaldsonville, and we are nearing completion of critical foundation work in Port Neal, so that we can continue with mechanical construction through the winter. Our capital expenditure projection for the year stands at $2 billion, consisting of $1.6 billion for the capacity expansion projects and $400 million for sustaining CapEx.","The reduction from our previous estimate of $1.7 billion for the expansion projects represents a change in timing of payments, not a change in the overall project budgets or schedules.","Finally, as we move into the fourth quarter, we have seen attractively priced gas making its way into inventory. We have also entered into collars for 90% of our gas needs through the first quarter of 2015, with floor prices averaging $3.41 per MMBtu and ceiling prices averaging $4.25. These hedges and the fixed bases differentials we have in place for our Port Neal and Courtright complexes have taken any significant winter gas price risks off the table.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Dennis. Many of you may have observed the news flow related to our recently terminated merger discussions with Yara. I think it's important to provide a little perspective on those discussions.","The discussions were, for CF, borne out of a position of strength. We have a well-defined, very specific business plan centered on our capacity expansions, the first operating unit of which will begin production within 10 months. Our plan is tangible, observable and requires no heroic assumptions, nor leaps of faith. The plan informs our view of the intrinsic value of CF Industries, which we believe is substantially above the price at which our share is currently trading.","As a management team, it is incumbent on us to execute our business plan but also to look for opportunities that will increase shareholder value above our plan. We engaged in the discussions with a strongly held and well-formed view of the value that should be attributable to CF Industries' shareholders in appreciation of the strong cash flow generation of a company, especially given the significant uplift in cash flow, which will occur as the expansion projects come online.","Although we were jointly able to identify operational and structural synergies significantly higher than any of the published estimates we saw, ultimately, we were not able to agree on terms that would have met the requirements of all the respective shareholders. Specifically, in the one and only metric that matters, we did not believe that CF Industries' shareholders would have been rewarded above and beyond our current business plan on a risk-adjusted basis. As a result, we ended the discussions. I would again like to thank the management team of Yara for their professionalism and their time. I hold their team in high regard.","In terms of what is next for CF Industries, we will continue to execute our business plan to realize the significant value we believe is embedded in it. The future is directly in front of us and largely within our control. We are confident in our belief that executing our plan will deliver significant value creation to our shareholders. We are focused on increasing cash flow per share by investing in high-return projects and otherwise, returning excess cash to shareholders through an attractive dividend and robust share repurchase programs.","With that, we will now open the line to answer your questions. Grace?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you just give us a little bit more perspective on the remaining CapEx in terms of, you're on time, you're on budget, what are the risks that remain between here and getting Donaldsonville started up in less than 10 months and then ultimately, Port Neal? What are you concerned about? Is it labor? Is it labor costs? Is it weather over the winter? What should we be paying attention to?","W. Anthony Will","We actually feel pretty good about delivery schedule of all the major equipment. Let's start off with diesel first, because that's the one that's closest. Then the urea plant should be starting up end of the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter next year. The issues out there, really, we have seen a little bit of a tightening in the labor market. With more and more projects coming online, there is some competition. But we believe we can put in place provisions to adequately address that and make sure we've got the right number of resources on site. We do have contingency funds built into both of our projects to anticipate escalation of labor cost that, frankly, we thought may have happened before this. So labor is one issue, but I think we can address it. The other one, as you mentioned, is weather. When it rains a lot, diesel, things get real soupy, it's tough to make a lot of forward progress. But we don't anticipate that really getting in the way between us and our anticipated start time. Relative to Port Neal, again, we feel good about vessel deliveries and critical equipment. We need to make sure we've got all the foundation support and ready to get into steel erection during the winter months, so we can make good forward progress there. But if anything, we feel that there's a little more cushion in the Port Neal time frame based on the commitments we've made to the market versus the progress that we're making. So we're not anticipating any real challenges without meeting that schedule.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up to that, if I'm thinking about this correctly, sort of hitting the time line and staying on budget as sort of the gating event for how you're thinking about using your cash flow and your balance sheet, whether it's for buybacks or increasing the dividend or what have you. So it sounds like you're progressing, sort of hitting your margin and hitting your targets and perhaps there was no buyback in the quarter because you were in discussions with Yara, but is that the right way to think about things? And as we progress through the next 6 months, would you anticipate that you'll continue to follow sort of the pattern of the last year or so where when you -- or as things are progressing according to plan and schedule, it seems to free up some of your desire to use the balance sheet or to use your cash flow. Is that the right way to think about it?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. I think that's a good characterization of where we are. We, as I said in my prepared remarks, believe that our shares don't reflect the intrinsic value of the company. And so we're absolutely buyers, and we'll execute that as appropriate as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question for Bert, just wondering about what your thoughts are in building the forward order book. You've told us what you expect to happen in ammonia for Q4. Maybe you could make some comments on how you're positioned in urea and UAN? And as you look forward to next spring, are you anticipating that we missed some applications this fall because of weather and that leads to very tight spring nitrogen market and just wondering if so, what -- how you're positioned to benefit from that?","Bert A. Frost","Good morning, and thanks. So for our order book, what we communicated, we're well-positioned through this year and into Q1 on UAN. We took a summer fill program through July and since have built on that program, and we'll continue to do so. We have in place our own inventory system that we can also place product in, in preparation for the spring. So for UAN, we're fairly confident of where we are and where the market will be and our ability to supply. On urea, as I mentioned, we have been generally spot sellers as the -- during Q2 and Q3, as the North American market traded above the international market. We were able to capture a positive price spread for the company. That has since come to parity, and as we roll out of Q4 and into the Q1, we expect that probably could continue, but we've continued to be spot sellers. And if that were to change, then we might take a different tact and do some forward selling. So right now, the U.S. is a little bit below the international market, so I would say we'll see a rising market going through Q1 and into Q2 for urea. On ammonia, I think the whole system has been a little bit short of product. Looking at data from TSI and just some industry feedback from the market, from our sales team, that seems to be the case and that's reflected in higher pricing where the Midwest market is at $650 to $680 a short ton in the I [ph] states. And so, I think as you go through Q4, you'll probably have, as we've presented, that we expect to hit last year's numbers, which were little underwhelming compared to historic ability, part of that is reflected in our large Q1 and Q2. We had a record ammonia application, record ammonia pull, almost 1.7 million tons through the first half of 2014 and I think our -- the whole industry had that same type of situation. So the ammonia -- that extra ammonia is just not available. So we expect pricing to be fairly positive going through Q2 next year, and we'll fully utilize our distribution system to capture that. On the spring, I think I just mentioned about your question on missed applications of ammonia being tight, I think I already mentioned that. So we're fairly positive going into 2015.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","And again, with missed applications and logistical difficulties, both rail barge and terminals, would you expect quite a potential fly up in prices because -- next spring, it sounds like that's what you're positioning your business for?","Bert A. Frost","On the fly up in prices, I think with -- we'll just have a massive amount of corn coming in right now. I'll let you turn the logistical question over to Chris.","Christopher D. Bohn","Yes, from a logistic standpoint, we've done several things. This was something that we anticipated happening coming out of last winter, so there's really 4 things we did, and that is we began to position our product earlier. We repositioned a lot of our assets. One thing we talk a lot about here at CF is just the flexibility of our distribution assets and our logistics assets, so we are able to lean on that a little bit more than some of our competitors or other industry participants. And we continue to have an intense amount of conversations with our carriers, both from a barge and a rail to let them know where we're going. And then, again, given the flexibility, we look at alternative modes, whether it be barge or rail. So I think for the most part, while we see some blips in some of the movements, there's nothing that's really concerned us or affected customer deliveries at all.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You seem to have changed your strategy on hedging. In the first 2 quarters, you were hedging at a one price level. In the third and fourth quarter, you're hedging with these collars. So what is the logic behind the change in strategy, if I understand it correctly? And then also, what is the cost of these collars?","W. Anthony Will","So P.J., one of the issues in the -- coming out of the third and fourth quarters of last year, we were pretty happy with the absolute price level that we saw, which was a Henry Hub deck of I think $3.66 in the first quarter and $3.55 in the second. As we got into the back end, the third quarter of this year, and we saw the dramatic increase in production and the fact that storage was rapidly building, still down relative to the 5-year average, but it was close to 3.5 TCF, and the fact that the increased rate of gas production continues at a high level, our view was, if the winter was moderate, there could be a lot of opportunity for our prices to continue to soften through the winter months in the first quarter. So we wanted to be able to participate in the softening or the potential for a softening gas market. At the same time as put an absolute ceiling on the top end of our cost structure. So that was why we entered into collars as opposed to fixed swap -- fixed price swaps, and on the pricing of the collars, I'll ask Chris to...","Christopher D. Bohn","Yes. The pricing of the collars, from a premium standpoint, were about $0.10 to $0.15, depending on -- we layered in several different layers of the collars for an average of $3.41 to $4.25.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then secondly, Tony, you've talked about this cost curve and that it's held quite well in the past cycles. I was wondering if you can give us a quick update on where did the high cost China producers stand today on that cost curve? And also an update on Ukraine and the gas situation there?","W. Anthony Will","Okay. Well, I'm going to ask Dennis to talk about Ukraine and what's going on there, but I think a fair bit of that is political unrest and uncertainty. But Dennis, do you want to...","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't know what's going to happen there, but to the degree that we see producers getting their gas curtailed because gas pump cuts them back for political reasons or the case -- or whatever the case may be. We're going to obviously see curtailments and therefore, less supply into the marketplace. The other thing that works against us, to some degree, is that if people have -- are getting gas and those gases are oil linked, you'll see people getting somewhat cheaper gas because of the lower oil price. So the way I would kind of look at it is, we don't know exactly what's going to happen in Ukraine and how the political events there are going to affect availability in pricing. But we do know that as we look back here over the past 6 months, that with respect to curtailments in Eastern Europe and other places generally, that has resulted in constricted supply and higher prices as Bert described in his prepared remarks.","W. Anthony Will","And P.J., based on where we see from a cost curve perspective, we estimate that China is kind of in that $3.30 to $3.50 per metric on a delivered basis and -- I'm sorry, on a fab [ph] basis, and Ukraine is sort of similarly in about a $3.40 to $3.50 per metric basis as well. And today, the price is about kind of $3.20-ish, $3.30-ish. And so, there's a number of those producers that are having a hard time making money or even operating at those rates.","Bert A. Frost","And I would suggest for granular, $3.20. The market for prilled today is in the $2.90 to $2.95, if you've seen from the Indian tenders. This is Bert. And what you're seeing is what Tony referenced as the negative returns for these companies and then the ratchet down on your average operating rate, which is below 70%. What that means is that people aren't operating, and we're seeing that reflected in the volume of product going into the bonded warehouses or not going into the bonded warehouses. Now we're projecting that China will be exporting between 10 million and 11 million tons for this year, which is a higher rate but they had additional capacity that came online and so longer-term, we see that rationalizing and decreasing if the pricing stays at this level.","W. Anthony Will","And Bert, of those 10 or 11 tons, how much is that granular versus prilled?","Bert A. Frost","I don't have that exact number, but it's mostly prilled, untreated prilled.","W. Anthony Will","And P.J., although the untreated prill does come out and it certainly does take nutrient, kind of, content away from other people, it's not a product that is generally received in many parts of the world. It's only a few specific markets that actually are willing to deal with the Chinese prills. So it has some overhang, but it's not directly comparable or affects the U.S. market on a one-for-one basis.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Tony, if we look out over the next couple of years, it would seem that there's a fair amount of nitrogen capacity expected to come online globally. On the other hand, the capacity that's already here isn't running very well as you illustrate on Slide #9. So can you give us a sense of what is driving these elevated levels of outage? How much might be geopolitics versus maybe assets in the West that have just been running too hard for too long? And how do you expect operating rates to trend in all of this?","W. Anthony Will","Yes, Kevin, that's a great question. In nitrogen, we have been in a supply-driven market condition for about a year now or maybe a little more than that. And so we are actually operating as opposed to a demand-driven situation where people are bidding up tons above marginal cost. It really is being driven off of marginal cost of production. And I think some of the outages, due to political unrest, you'd expect those things to moderate over time, but some outages are really due to gas availability. So for instance, Egypt, Oman, Trinidad, there are a number of places in the world where there are just physically gas shortages to be able to run the assets at full rates. In the West, it really has probably been more a maintenance or unplanned operational outages that have caused curtailments; it's certainly not an economic driver. But even in China, I think they brought on something in the neighborhood of about 20 million tons of urea production in the last 3 or 4 years, and I think they've taken about 5 million to 6 million tons permanently offline in the last year. And so, although there will continue to be new capacity brought online, what you're going to end up seeing is shedding assets at the very highest end of the cost curve. And the point that I want to reinforce is, even though the market in nitrogen is operating in a supply-driven arena and North American gas costs were a little high, we still generated 40% gross margins in those conditions. Underlying that, on positives going forward, there will continue to be ongoing market demand growth for nitrogen, both in the industrial applications and some on the agricultural side. And we're seeing North America continue to be an important marketplace through the end of this decade.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Second question would be regarding your MOE discussions with Yara. Maybe 2 parts. First, was it the inability to settle on a specific number that caused you to discontinue the negotiations, or were there structural barriers that were problematic, such as tax or perhaps both? And then second, I think you made a comment that your synergy numbers were projected to be much higher than the published estimates that you saw from The Street. What do you think The Street was missing?","W. Anthony Will","So Kevin, there has been an awful lot of talk and discussion about things like tax inversions and so forth. And we, very early on, had conversations with the IRS and got an indication from them that they viewed this not as an inversion transaction, but actually as traditional cross-border M&A. So there was nothing here that was out of the ordinary and therefore, there was no kind of regulatory or structural impediments from that perspective going forward. But what I think the market may not have recognized as much is all of the areas where there really were an awful lot of overlap or opportunities to rationalize. So people that are spending the time looking at these things realize that Yara moves an awful lot of products out of Europe into North America. And in fact, we export a fair bit of product out of North America and send it the other direction. We literally have ships passing in the middle of the night. If you look at their Belle Plaine facility and how it would have fit into our North American asset base and distribution structure, it would have been a really nice add. And they are quite a bit product short in Latin America and for us, Donaldsonville, it's $30 to $35 to move product into the Corn Belt. It's $30 to $35 to move it down into Brazil and Argentina. And when we move it offshore, we could have structured it through some offshore trading companies in a way that would have been very, very tax efficient. And I don't know that people really kind of stepped back and understood what the current tax laws are and the opportunity. We're paying tax on a marginal rate, almost 35%, and we certainly could have put that in a different sphere, being located in a different tax regime. So I think people missed all of those things. And I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of kind of why things didn't happen, but I would just characterize it as, at the end of the day, we feel we've got a terrific value proposition from our standalone business plan. And given all of the puts and takes that were on the table, we didn't think on a risk-adjusted basis, it was going to end up being a good deal for CF shareholders relative to what we can offer them today.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","You hit on a little of this, but on Slide 9, you go over the last 5 years of reported outages in both ammonia and urea. Can you just go over your current view for the 2015, particularly in Trinidad and also the Middle East and North Africa region?","W. Anthony Will","Yes, Chris, I'll ask Bert to opine as well and Dennis, but I -- look, I don't think Trinidad has done anything to structurally solve the gas availability issue going into Point Lisas. And I don't know that there's a quick fix on the horizon. So I would anticipate there being ongoing gas curtailments going forward. In Trinidad, that could be in the 10% to 15% of production range. Relative to Middle East and North Africa, you still don't really have recognized sort of basis of power and influence in some regions like Libya and other places to make operations reasonable. And you also have gas shortages in Egypt and Oman, again, for which there's not a quick solution. So my perspective is I don't think that you're going to see a dramatic uptick in production from those areas. But Dennis and Bert, you got...","Dennis P. Kelleher","I think if you look at North Africa, you got to look at it in 3 buckets. And if you look at Egypt, for instance, where they produce nitrogen today, the issue there really is gas availability and potentially, politics in terms of getting plants started up and keeping them running. When you look over at Libya, again, there's plenty of gas that's available that could be put into a facility. The problem is that the situation there is so unsafe and so unstable, that it's difficult to keep a plant up and running with people and staffing it for a prolonged period of time. And as you move further west to Algeria, there certainly is plenty of gas to the degree they have outages, they're largely going to be driven by operational issues or issues between the people who own the foreign participating share in these joint ventures and [indiscernible]. And those things can be sometimes a bit intractable, as we saw earlier last year. So -- but I would say about the supply of North Africa is, we don't have any crystal ball but with those sources of potential uncertainty and instability, it's very difficult to really kind of draw a supply curve for North Africa with any degree of reliability or accuracy.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned some themes in China which many of us have been monitoring, which could potentially help the floor price. Could you just further elaborate on which aspects you view as the most material including various tax regimes and also, the overall industry attempting to help stabilize export prices?","W. Anthony Will","Yes. I'll give you a few and then I'm going to pass this over to Bert for his -- him to weigh in as well. There's a couple of issues, one of which is the changing regulations on what's acceptable for our imported coal in the way of fly ash and sulfur, means that there's less sea borne coal that's actually eligible to enter the marketplace. It puts on higher demand on domestic coal and that will drive up coal prices to some extent. Similarly, you see some reduction in the availability or an increase in that corresponding price of gas going into the gas-driven plants in China. Those things help from a cost structure standpoint. You've seen movement away from subsidized rail rates and port costs and other things. All of those things mean that the producers or the traders that want to take possession of those goods are incurring real economic cost for all of those movements, all of those things, mean the price has to rise for that product to show up at a profit on the international scene. And finally, as you mentioned, there's the 5% tax that's flat across the year. My perspective on that one is that's very helpful for our business. You don't see these big movements where inventories balloon up and then disgorge that drive some funkiness in terms of buying behaviors, particularly in places with large tenders like India and Pakistan. And I think if you see more ratable product coming out of some of those regions, it leads to more stability in the pricing on a global basis. But Bert, do you have other thoughts?","Bert A. Frost","No, I think you've touched on the key ones, and they all reflect a positive perspective or a positive opportunity for the industry going forward. Costs are going up. Coal, freight, labor, those are positives for our business. The 5% tax, I agree with Tony and that the rational nature of that will bring to the overall supply and the supply availability coming out of China. The demand structure is in place domestically for Chinese consumption. We've been tracking that as well as industrial demand, which is also fairly consistent. So it's that available tonnage that will be exported and then, at what economical cost that will be exported for. Fantastic demand going forward out of India and Pakistan that is open to receive the untreated prilled product coming out of China. So you set up a system that, that probably will be the supply base for those regions and the granular that is coming out of China today is at a quality disadvantage and is trading at a $20 to $25 discount to domestically-produced product in North America. So I look at these things as coming together. It's a maturing of our industry, a maturing of the industry in China, and we see those as positives going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question on the Woodward facility. This was the downtime that you announced a few weeks ago. This is the second major shutdown in the plants in this year. And I think both times you cited boilers in the press release. And I think there was schedule turnaround activity that took place earlier in the year on the back of the first shutdown. Can you maybe just elaborate on what actually happened at the facility, the confidence that you have in the sustainability of the capital equipment and the investments that you are making there on an ongoing basis?","W. Anthony Will","You bet, Adam. The big issue at -- one of the big issues at Woodward is it is 1 of 2 non-Kellogg plants that we have in our North American system. In fact, the intellectual property or process designers of that plant was Fluor. And there's only 2 Fluor ammonia plants in the world. So this one is a little bit of an oddity or a strange beast. And the parts that go into it are dissimilar from all of our Kellogg plants. So if this has happened at one of our Kellogg ammonia plants, it would've been really easy to fix because we've got spare kit for all of the major operating components so we could have just moved the product or moved our OAC [ph] boiler out of one facility into the next, plugged it in and are ready to go. So we have a huge operational footprint advantage with 11 of our 13 ammonia plants being Kellogg plants and able to swap and receive similar vessels. But because this is an oddball, we've got to fix what's there. And this particular, it's the same OAC [ph] boiler in both cases. There's the primary OAC [ph] boiler, and in the first instance, we had a failure of the insulation refractory. In the second case, we had a failure with internal tube bundle. We're working hard to get it replaced. We don't believe that there is any long-term issue in terms of the operability or the on-stream factor of that plant. We're just working through one particular problem that's been going on this year. And it's unfortunate because, as Bert pointed out, we're going to lose close to $50 million of gross margin out of that facility this year because of the outages. But the good news is we didn't have any one hurt. We didn't have any offsite impacts to the community or environmental releases, and those are things that have much more long-term and problematic impact for our company than missing a few weeks of production. So we're...","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Appreciate that color. And then maybe just switching gears, your major western Canadian peer yesterday was talking about repatriating tonnage in Western Canada into the retail segments and my understanding was a lot of that tonnage was emanating from Medicine Hat when Viterra owned the 33% stake. How are you looking at your marketing strategy in Western Canada and your ability to find a home for the tonnage that maybe -- may need a new home outside of the Agrium system in Western Canada?","W. Anthony Will","Yes, I'll give you just a high-level comment and then I will ask Bert to go into details. We -- as part of the 1\/3 interest that we bought, we also purchased a couple of ammonia terminals, one of which is, as Bert indicated in his comments, was Vanscoy Saskatchewan. We set an all-time shipping record for ammonia out of that facility this year. And it is, at the end of the day, a commodity product where it's a competitive marketplace and pricing is set by outside dynamics. And we feel very comfortable in terms of our ability to focus our tons on the best netbacks possible and we think we're in a good position to do it. But I'll let Bert talk specifics of...","Bert A. Frost","I would say from just looking at our system, we're not wedded to a market and we're not market share-focused and we're not going to say that a certain percentage of our tonnage needs to be directed to one market. We're more netback-driven. And so if that netback that we can receive at any of the markets is greater than where that ton is currently allocated, it will be allocated on a netback basis. And we have built our team in Western Canada. We used to market that through distribution. And a couple of years ago, we've put in place our own team that has integrated very well into our system. And were seamlessly moving the Viterra tons as well as our historical tons out of Medicine Hat into Western Canada and other markets as well. And so hopefully, you're seeing us being good marketers and executors of our system and our strategies. But Western Canada is a good market, and we'll continue to focus on that and to build our relationships with our customers there. But whether it goes there or Montana or North Dakota, we're ambivalent as long as it's netback-driven.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Tony, you said that again that you like CF's footprint as you said last quarter. So do the substantial synergies that you say you found with Yara changed your view of CF's global opportunity and make you more interested in looking further, exploring further overseas or maybe looking for more deals there?","W. Anthony Will","Thanks for the question, Mark. Look, I'd say we evaluate and are open to opportunities kind of globally anywhere as long as they fit the following criteria: as long as they're in our core strategic fairway and have a return profile that's well in excess of our cost of capital. But our standalone business plans sets a really high bar on what these things need to achieve in order for us to be interested in going after them, if it's something other than a cash basis. If we have to use our stock in order to acquire them, then it sets a really high bar on the return profile. We have looked at a lot of projects over the years, some of them we've done, some of them we didn't. Things that we've done include the 50% acquisition of KEYTRADE, the Terra acquisition, the 1\/3 interest in Medicine Hat, along with the Canadian ammonia terminals, the divestiture of phosphate and the capacity expansion projects. And I think if you look at what we've done, the market would say, \"Wow, all of those have been pretty darn good deals.\" There are some things that we announced that we didn't do. Coal gasification at Donaldsonville, looking at an ammonia, urea complex in Peru after we had secured a gasify agreement down there and then most recently, Yara. So the ones that we haven't done, I think we've had very good and valid reasons for not doing those. There's other ones that are currently in consideration right now, things like Medicine Hat urea that we've talked about. And the issue is, we like that marketplace. We like urea in that marketplace. But the concern in that region is the high cost and unpredictability of labor and we must -- we can guarantee a full end [ph] cost structure including labor that I can say to you all we've got a return well in excess of our cost of capital, then we won't be doing that project. So that's why we've been sort of silent as we're working that to refine it behind the scenes. So as long as it's in our core business, there is not a geographic constraint on where we will or we won't be, but it's got to be a great deal for our shareholders or we are not interested in doing it.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. I'm going to take that as a no. And just one quick question. As you look out at 2017 and beyond, what is your best estimate of North America's net import position in ammonia and urea?","W. Anthony Will","So today, North America imports, I think, about 40% of its total nitrogen requirements. After all of the projects that are actually in-flight come online, so those things would include a bunch of bottlenecks that have happened from Agrium and Koch and CF, it would include the OCI project, it would include the Waggaman, Louisiana project and the CF projects. After the things that are actually real steel in the ground have come online, we think that number drops to about 20%. So through -- as you're sitting, looking at beyond '17 and into 18, we think that North America will continue to import about 20% of its total nitrogen requirements. Now that's going to skew by product type. There's going to be less UAN that needs to be brought in because the market will almost be in balance in UAN, but there's still be a fair bit of ammonia and urea that need to be brought in. But -- and if there are some of these other projects that have been talked about, whether it's the CHS Girdwood project or other ones that will start eating into that 20%. But if all of the things that are being added only account for about 20% of the requirements, that means for North America to be in balance, you need another set of projects like D'ville, Port Neal, Waggaman, Weaver and then all of the debottlenecks that have taken place, that's going to take a fair bit of capital over a fairly extended period of time. So that's why we are very confident in the notion that North America will continue to be an import marketplace out through the end of the decade.","Operator","Our final question would be from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","In looking at some of the synergies you mentioned that you could have achieved as part of a larger network with Yara, are there ways on your own that you can try to achieve some of those offshore export opportunities being able to maybe put together something overseas and be able to take care of some export opportunities into South America and other places?","W. Anthony Will","Thanks, Joel. I think one of the things that surfaced as part of our discussions was a recognition by both Yara and CF that there may be very viable commercial ways where we can work together to realize some of those synergies and we're certainly interested in exploring what those might be. And so I'd say absolutely. There's some of them that are predicated on a more structural basis that are tough to get to, but of the ones that are purely kind of commercially available, yes, we absolutely would be interested in going after those.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And finally, have you looked at -- I'm sure you have looked at the west side partner's structure for the MLP as you get closer to finishing up Donaldsonville and Port Neal. Have you walked through that structure, gather some pros and cons that you would talk about in that structure that could work or not work for CF going forward?","Dennis P. Kelleher","Yes, Joel, this is Dennis. Thanks for the question. Yes, Joel, we've spent a lot of time over the past year or so looking at MLP structures generally, as you know. I think we're the only major nitrogen producer that actually has an MLP, so it's something that's we studied in detail and also know something a bit about because of what we have. And the way we think about it is, that structure in particular that you mentioned, sort of fixed pay structure and fixed pay structures suck up debt capacity. And because we talk to rating agencies on a regular basis. And as we look at our opportunity going -- particularly as the projects come online, we see ourselves having a materially larger amount of debt capacity as those projects start to come online. And the after-tax cost of that debt is much lower than the after-tax cost of doing any kind of fixed rate structure like the one that you are suggesting. In addition to that, the size of deals that you can do with that type of structure, really, are around $300 million per year or less. So there's a lot of execution risk as you think about trying to do something of a much larger scale over a prolonged period of time than there is with debt. You'll know that what we did with our debt portfolios in the last 2 years, we've issued $3 billion of debt in 2 $1.5 billion tranches, and we can get those deals done in a month with little or no execution risk. And in addition to that, a lot of people have really raised this issue, the particular transaction that you referenced, but we note that nobody else out there has tried to replicate that structure. And some people have suggested that there's some great read-through in terms of valuation to the C Corp, but as we've tracked that particular company's stock since before it announced its MLP structure through today and compared that to another very closely, a very similar company, what we've seen is that the value of that stock has gone down significantly. Its multiple has gone down. And really, it doesn't trade at a premium to either that competitor company and it trades, at least at the data I saw, at a lower multiple to ourselves. So as far as the whole read-through argument is concerned, what we see is that there's really no there, there [ph]. So we don't have a religious sort of conviction against doing interesting transactions, but what is important to us is, that as we look at them on a risk-adjusted basis, they provide real and tangible value to our C Corp shareholders.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions for today.

Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we posted our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016 in which we generated adjusted EBITDA of $133 million and $858 million respectively, after taking into account the items detailed in our earnings release.","Bert and Dennis will cover our fourth quarter, full year and near-term outlook in more detail later. What I'd like to do is offer a longer-term perspective on our industry and why we believe our strategic position makes us the company best situated to capitalize on the emerging sector recovery. For the past 12 months, we have experienced some of the most challenging conditions the nitrogen industry has faced in over a decade.","Global feedstock and ocean freight costs fell as capacity additions came online, driving prices to unsustainable lows. The dramatic decline in nitrogen prices as demonstrated by U.S. Gulf urea fallen by more than $170 per ton or roughly 50% from 2015 to the middle of 2016 impacted our results more than most because we are a pure-play nitrogen production company. The converse should also prove to be true as prices rebound with price increases going directly to our bottom line, because we are one of the world's largest producers of nitrogen products and enjoy among the very lowest costs, nitrogen price recovery should haven't amplify the impact on our financial results.","We believe that 2016 represented the low point of the cycle. The unsustainably low prices of 2016 led to the very predictable outcome of plant curtailments and permanent shutdowns in higher cost regions.","In China alone, approximately 9 million metric tons of urea capacity were permanently closed and the industry as a whole ended the year running at only about 50% of remaining effective capacity. Nitrogen prices at the U.S. Gulf today, although continuing to trade below international parity, are up on average year-to-date compared to last year. The new capacity will come online in 2017, it will be well below the rate of the past two years as shown on slide 15 of our materials. Industry observers have pointed to approximately 4 million tons of net urea capacity coming online in 2017. However, approximately one-third of that is only upgrades of existing ammonia and does not represent new nitrogen production. Post 2017 and through the foreseeable future, the rate of new capacity growth is expected to be well below the normal annual demand growth rate of roughly 2%, thereby tightening the global SNB (5:26) balance and driving sustained price recovery.","Although we believe the first half of this year is shaping up nicely, uncertainty exists for the second half, particularly given the evolving nature of buyer behavior. Because of our ability to efficiently access the export market, coupled with our large in-market storage capacity, we also believe we are best positioned to maximize results even if North American buyers delay purchases like they did last year.","With this backdrop, it is clear why we believe CF Industries is the best positioned company to benefit from the emerging cyclical recovery. CF is a strong company, our structural advantages, access to low cost North American natural gas, operating in an import dependent North America and the long-term demand growth for nitrogen are well-established and enduring. Our operational advantages, scale, production flexibility, significant in-region storage and export optionality set us apart from other producers. Taken together, they position CF to benefit disproportionately from the improving price environment we see before us.","Now, let me turn the call over to Bert, who will talk about the market and our outlook in more detail. And Dennis will discuss our financial performance before I offer some closing remarks. Bert?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Tony. At the end of the third quarter, we discussed our fundamental economics would continue to pressure high-cost producers and result in higher nitrogen prices globally. Additionally, we expected North American customers to increase buying headed into 2017 after delaying purchases in 2016. Both dynamics are playing out today as we enter the spring season in the United States.","I want to start with the demand side of the story. During 2016, many customers believe prices would continue to fall as additional nitrogen capacity came online because they did not want to take the price risk associated with buying early, many stayed on the sidelines and only purchased minimal volumes. Domestic and international suppliers both chased what demand materialized. This resulted in weak pricing in North America that was not only below international parity, much of the year, but also well below cash costs for many high-cost producers.","Not surprisingly, this made it difficult for foreign producers to send product economically to North America. Indeed, imports of urea and UAN were approximately 33% lower in the second half of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Demand was also lower than expected during the fall ammonia season, due to weather and farm level economic decisions.","Unfavorable weather in the fall limited the application window as soil temperatures in many areas were too high at the start of the season and then cold temperatures and snow developed too quickly. Farm level economic considerations especially declining year-over-year farmer disposable income, due to a low corn and wheat prices negatively impacted decisions to purchase and apply ammonia. Additionally, future prices favored soybeans over corn for the first time since 2008. Historically, relatively favorable returns on beans have coincided with weaker fall ammonia applications as growers deferred fertilizer and planting decisions until spring, this year was no different.","However, demand doesn't just go away, it only gets deferred. Nitrogen is not a discretionary nutrient and current corn prices still provide farmers the incentive to apply nitrogen at historical levels. Because of purchasing delays and lower imports, we believe that entering the year, North American customers had secured only a portion of their 2017 needs and we're behind the normal purchasing and shipment pattern. Customers are aware of the need to close this gap. We had record shipments of UAN in the fourth quarter, over 2 million tons for the first time, as customers built positions for spring after delaying purchases earlier in the year. Because we're able to optimize our business even when North American demand is low, we are well-positioned to serve our customers as they increase their purchasing pace. With approximately 3 million tons of ammonia, UAN and urea storage owned and leased in the United States and Canada, we can choose to position product for the future sales in North America and we are doing just that.","We can also sell to our growing portfolio of global customers. During the fourth quarter, we had just one of Donaldsonville's two deepwater docks available. The second dock is being upgraded to load UAN more than two times as quickly, and ammonia three times faster than before. Nevertheless, we loaded 16 export vessels totaling approximately 500,000 tons, a new company quarterly record for exports. This flexibility benefits the company throughout the year and proves invaluable at times like now when an early application season develops due to warm weather. Because we did not have to sell in advance at unreasonably low prices, we were ready for the early ammonia movement now occurring in Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri.","Additionally, because there are logistical constraints on the ammonia distribution system, it will be difficult for farmers to fully make up for the weak fall ammonia application season. Most likely, that means farmers will move a greater portion of their needs to urea and UAN, which we're ready to supply through our distribution facilities. As we sell into this early spring season, U.S. Gulf urea barge prices have rebounded ranging between $230 per short ton to $250 per short ton in the first quarter. The most important driver of these prices has been a decline in Chinese urea exports. They dropped from more than 1 million metric tons per month than the first quarter of 2016 to an average of approximately 470,000 metric tons per month in the fourth quarter.","Low global prices, rising costs for marginal producers in China, including significantly higher coal costs compared to the middle of 2016, and the removal of subsidies and concerns over pollution and air quality, drove urea operating rates down to approximately 50% during the fourth quarter and into February. At these operating rates, seasonal demand for Chinese urea is expected to exceed supply even with reduced exports. Indeed, we may see some tons from Chinese port inventories returning to the domestic market as well as imports from Iran. Our analysis suggests that, at recent operating rates, China may not be able to satisfy local demand and will instead have to import product. As a result, we expect Chinese manufacturers to focus on their home region and for urea exports to total only 5 million metric tons to 6 million metric tons this year, a decline of approximately 60% from two years ago.","The reduced availability of Chinese urea, along with higher hydrocarbon feedstock cost globally, should support prices as we move forward. Supply and demand dynamics will adjust, again, later this year as the market absorbs the increase in global urea capacity expected to come online during 2017. However, we remain confident in our ability to optimize our business, as we've done this year, given the flexibility we've built into our manufacturing, distribution and logistics systems. This will be an enduring advantage for CF.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Bert. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the company reported an EBITDA loss of $135 million and a net loss per diluted share of $1.38. After taking into account the items detailed in our press release, our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $133 million and our adjusted net loss per diluted share was $0.39.","I will cover the two largest adjustments here. First, we announced during the fourth quarter we completed the refinancing of the private placement notes with maturity dates of 2022, 2025 and 2027 to put in place financing more consistent with the current business structure and operating environment. The make-whole payment associated with the early refinancing of those notes was approximately $170 million. However, as a result of the refinancing, we were able to reduce the average coupon rate of the debt from 4.9% to 4.1%.","Second, during the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recognized an impairment charge of $134 million relating to its equity method investment in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited in Trinidad. This was due to projected longer-term challenges with gas availability, and potential price increases from the government-controlled gas supplier. With the completion of the capacity expansion projects, you will see a number of line items in our P&L return to more normal levels. There will be no startup costs in 2017. Capitalized interest, which was $166 million in 2016, is expected to be less than $5 million in 2017. As a result, interest expense will be approximately $320 million this year.","New capital expenditures for 2017 are expected to be in the range of approximately $400 million to $450 million for sustaining and other, which is a level that continues the company's commitment to safe, reliable, and compliant operations. Actual cash expenditures will also reflect amounts accrued but not paid in 2016. At December 31, 2016, approximately $225 million was accrued related to activities that occurred in 2016.","Finally, depreciation expense in 2017 will reflect that all new capacity expansion assets will be in service for the full year. We expect total depreciation expense to rise to approximately $875 million. This will impact gross margin per ton for all the applicable segments. With the expansion projects behind us and an improving environment ahead of us, we will continue our prudent approach to managing the balance sheet in order to be in a position to retire $800 million of debt coming due in 2018. The 2018 debt retirement will largely be funded by the federal and state tax refunds we expect to receive in the third quarter of 2017 of approximately $800 million.","With that, Tony will provide some closing remarks before we open the call to Q&A.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, Dennis. Before we move to your questions, I want to add some commentary to one of the last items Dennis mentioned, the $800 million tax refund we expect later this year. As you know, this is a one-time benefit due primarily to accelerated, or bonus, tax depreciation on our multibillion dollar investment in the United States.","In 2018 and thereafter, we expect our cash tax rate to be close to the 35% statutory tax rate. So, we are actively participating in the debate on tax reform. While discussions are still in early stages and many of the details are yet to be worked out, the house tax reform framework looks very promising.","A reduction in the corporate tax rate levels the competitive playing field with the rest of the world and generates earnings and cash flow that drops straight to our bottom-line. Further, the border adjustment tax is a concept that mirrors barriers we confront today. We face import taxes and tariffs for our products into Europe, China, and other geographies while foreign producers, who sell into the U.S. market, face no such import tax or tariff. This concept would also help to level the competitive global playing field. Further, it could also provide a benefit to our company, given both our significant manufacturing presence in the United States and our capability to export. We believe the house framework for tax reform would be good for America, good for CF Industries, its employees, and its shareholders.","In closing, I want to thank all of our employees, who've stayed focused on executing our business during a challenging year. They've kept their eyes on what's most important, operating safely, and serving our customers well. All of us appreciate their contributions and we're looking forward to the improving environment we see ahead.","With that, operator, we'll open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment for our first question, is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Given your outlook for 5 million tons to 6 million tons of Chinese urea exports as you can speak to that versus 8.9 million tons last year, how do you view the marginal cost of the new export level versus the past two years given Chinese own internal cost curve and some of the higher cost tons now being shut-in. Do you think that the FOB price will be roughly the same or potentially higher or lower?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning, Chris. This is Bert. And so, looking at China, each year we've seen so many changes to their structure and their economic structure as well as the drivers of their business that we have to continue to stay on top of what's happening over there. And we have been taking a look at that. Looking first to the feedstock costs and what's going on with coal, as you know, they've restricted coal operating rates last year and then released that to move back up to 330 days. We've seen reports today from Bloomberg where they're looking to restrict that back to the 276 days. That one impact had our cost driving impact on the price of coal. And so, you look at the buildup to their structural costs being coal, energy, internal freight and just operating costs, we estimate that the marginal anthracite producer was in the range in 2016 of $215 per ton to maybe $220 per ton of cost, even today that's probably $20 higher on a total structural cost basis. What that doesn't take into account is the fact that again through industry reports, there were losses estimated to be as high as RMB9.2 billion last year in China.","And so, we had prices fall as low as, let's say, $180, $190 metric ton FOB China. Today, again losing all that money and a structural cost differential, the floor price has to be significantly higher than it was last year. Coupled with ocean freight cost of at least $10 per ton to arrive in the United States, that total cost structure is probably closer to $30. That doesn't even take into account the catastrophe that they are experiencing today with pollution issues. We monitor different cities per day on the particulate matter that is in the air, and as compared to the United States, it's an infinitesimal calculation on percentages of what they are operating and there is a report out of Bloomberg, I think yesterday, maybe the New York Times a few days ago, where they are estimating 1.1 million people are dying as an impact of pollution. So, we are going to see that the story is not just economic, out of China, it's structural and that we think it's permanent and going from 14 million tons of export urea and if we're right, 5 million tons to 6 million tons; if we're wrong 6 million tons to 7 million tons, it's still a big change and we think it's a change that will be ongoing.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","It's a great color. And just turning to ammonia, given the recent volatility in energy prices, can you just broadly comment on your long-term outlook for gas price between Eastern European producers versus domestic and how this factors into the merchant ammonia market? And then also very quickly if you have any \u2013 given the change in import balances in the U.S., do you view the dichotomy between Black Sea and Tampa prices evolving differently over the next few years? Thank you.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Looking at \u2013 I'm uncomfortable giving a long-term outlook because it's \u2013 we've moved from $500 to $200 and some dollars back up to $320 today. And so, you've got different cost structures driving some of that. Today, you've got gas costs in the $6 range in Eastern Europe, and what we're seeing at our own operation in the UK, and you can see our gas costs are below $3. So, you do have a structural cost advantage in the United States, but as we articulated about our Trinidadian issues with the lack of gas, there's a significant amount of ammonia coming out of Trinidad that we believe will be constrained going forward. And so, these things are all in flux right now with where supply will be. And then, the issue with Togliatti that took place late last year with the shutdown of the pipe and loading out of the Black Sea, and the operation of the OPZ plant in Ukraine, all of those factors impacted seaborne ammonia trade.","I think that some of those factors will be mitigated a little bit, but that doesn't mean that long-term you can supply coming out of the Black or the Baltic that number is this low. And so, I would expect you're going to see a moderating price on ammonia going forward in establishing a new normal.","The LNG coming into Europe, there is a significant amount of LNG and that structural cost is in line with where gas is supplied today. And then you've got your Russian ruble revaluing and so the cost structure for that gas is going to be higher also. So, we think these are positives going into the longer term.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","(23:40) and good morning, everyone. We all seen the import data into the U.S. and it's obviously below prior year and below what is expected to be necessary for urea, but we also see that the prices continue to lag import netbacks. Why do you think that is and is your expectation if that's going to change in the coming weeks and I'm just curious because we've seen sort of a downtick in urea prices this week in the Gulf? So, any color there would be helpful?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. When I'm dreaming at night, I think of urea prices, it's always going up because it's not reality in life. And so, we do have moderating factors just like the stock market goes up and down, and people have retrenching times or repositioning times that happens also in urea, we have seen that this week where it sell into the $230s and so, significantly below the international market. We are trending lower year-on-year for imports of both UAN and urea and that's natural. We have additional production capacity at Donaldsonville and Port Neal, that's fully operating today. And so, looking at spring, there are a lot of factors and each spring is different. Last year, we had a raise-up through margin than a fall all the way through to August where the flow was established. Previous years have been different in different structures. What is looking like this year is an early spring. We're seeing activity today on ammonia and that probably bodes well for early planting and earlier applications. But if the end market isn't buying and some of those retailers and farmers have not, then the stuff that's on the water today and barges have to be cleared and a clearing price has to be established. We think that's a temporary small blip and a retrenchment and then we're going to see prices moderate up into March and probably through spring. But we do need less imports than previous years. And that's either going to come through price or people not purchasing and bringing here, because other markets are more attractive, both those scenarios are in place today.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And it's like, just to ask a follow-ups of a higher-level question something that we're debating a lot here. Which store scenario would you prefer, a high global capacity utilization, but a flatter cost curve or a lower global capacity utilization, but a very steep cost curve?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I think it's got to be the second one, Vincent. That is really the situation that largely existed through kind of the big run-up from 2010 through 2013 and into 2014 which was \u2013 there was ample production capacity out there, but it was a very steep curve and it was just the incremental plants that would be bid into the marketplace based on where demand settled for those years and that's clearly our preference. We believe that hydrocarbon cost will strengthen, freight cost will continue to come back and the spread between our U.S. delivered cost basis and what is going to take to get imported tons into the Gulf and up into the Midwest will provide us a very healthy return on our asset base.","So, we're \u2013 especially as we look forward where based on kind of our analysis of the new production coming up or going to be trending closer towards a supply driven market \u2013 from a supply driven into more of a demand driven marketplace bidding on some of those higher cost tons as you get out into 2018, 2019 and 2020, because they are just as not enough new steel being put in the ground to satisfy ongoing demand growth for these products. So, we're very optimistic about what the longer term holds.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. For the question on your outlook for the inland price premium for nitrogen products, especially as new capacity comes up there both your own and competitors, how do you see that unfolding? And I assume that this more aggressive export shipment pattern you have now is an attempt to kind of drain the Corn Belt of excess products. So, if you could just describe your outlook for that inland price premium and your export activity going forward?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Good morning. So, the \u2013 when you look at the premium as you stair-step outside or up from NOLA into the Southwest, the Midwest and the Northern Plains, the premium is built on transportation costs. And so, you can barge up through St. Louis or up to Minneapolis and then truck out or rail out, and we do each of those activities; and that's a cost. And so, to do that, you're going to want to be paid more for it. If you have better options available, you're going to take those different options.","The second part of your question on exports, the exports to us are attractive because it's a timing issue. With North America consumption largely based on April \u2013 March, April, May, the preponderance of our exports occur in Q3 and Q4. And so, we have significant level of capacity in Donaldsonville and, as I've mentioned, the ability to load it quickly, we're able to achieve fairly attractive economics. And that, parallel with what customers were unwilling to commit to in Q3 and Q4, made exports attractive for us. If that changes, if buyer behavior changes and reverts to how it was in, let's say, the 2007 to 2015 period, then the North American market will be more attractive. And so, we have to balance each of that with our asset base and what \u2013 to keep our asset base running at full capacity, that's why we utilize the exports. We do fully anticipate the inland premium to hold and to make imports attractive. We still will be an import market going forward and we'll need to bid those tons in.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Don, the other thing I would point out, back to Bert's comment about when buyers step into the marketplace is, in hindsight, I think buyers would've been much better off stepping in during the third quarter fill program that we normally offer, because they would have realized average prices well below where they are today. And they were completely unwilling to take that inventory price risk, and so you get what you got, right? And so, I think Bert's approach here is the right one, which is if there's \u2013 if they're not buying here, we're going to take it to where they are. And then, people in the U.S. are going to have to bid those tons back in, again, in the future. So, I think it sets up well in terms of our ability to export in the way that Bert's executing our strategy here.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just to follow up on those exports, so would you anticipate sort of a 500,000 ton quarterly run rate or is that above normal? And how do those netbacks on exports compare to your normal NOLA netbacks?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","It's a developing issue, because when we looked at the capacity coming online several years ago, we started the work on the export program, developing the customer base and travelling and looking for options \u2013 new options, and that's what we've developed in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and have grown our base in Argentina. We also have contracts into Belgium and France, and now looking to leverage our position in the UK. So, I don't really want to put a specific number. I was surprised myself that it was 1 million tons \u2013 over 1 million tons of UAN in 2016. But I think we're economically driven, and if the economics are there and it makes more sense for the company, I would not put 500,000 tons per quarter. That was just a pretty large quarter for us.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. This is Dan Jester on for P.J. So, turning to the U.S. demand outlook, I think that you said that you think the corn acres are going to be down this year, wheat acres are going to be down, but that overall nitrogen demand kind of would be flattish. So, is that just that the delayed ammonia application from last year get pushed into 2017 or is there something else that you think that can make up for some of that differential?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yes, actually. So, we do anticipate there were 200,000 tons to 400,000 tons of ammonia that did not go down in the fall that will need to be pushed into the spring. So, that's a total end number that just shifts to a March, April, May application. But, yes, corn acres were at 89,500 (32:58) and some others were a little bit higher than that, and so it's a decrease in corn acres. We do say a decrease in wheat acres, stock-to-use ratios on wheat are exceptionally high; corn not necessarily so. When you look at the world, the world, rest of the world, when you take out China, is at historical averages for stock-to-use ratio. So, we think it's a correcting issue in China for corn, but for the rest of the world business as usual. But how that impacts nitrogen demand is, you're going to see those acres shift and we're expecting a canola increase in Canada as well as a sorghum increase in the United States, and probably some barley. And so, when you look at the total acres, it's \u2013 or I should say total consumption based on acreage, it's a de minimis amount that \u2013 if it were to be a decrease. But today, with corn being over $4.00, corn is going to probably everyday be an attractive option for farmers as we roll into spring; so, more to come.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And then, can you just talk about what your \u2013 the impairment of the Trinidad assets and it looks like ammonia production in Trinidad is lower than it has been in the past, but it has stabilized. So, what do you think in terms of the outlook for the gas situation in Trinidad and the ability of that country to sort of recover some of that lost ammonia production? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think Trinidad present some problems out there for the government because it's pretty clear that the producers, gas producers on the island are unwilling to continue to invest in their E&P activities based on the current gas contracts that have been promised to the users of gas within point leases. And you've seen as those contracts have rolled off companies trying to renegotiate new contracts, but those tend to be at higher and higher prices. And as you look forward, the price that again this being paid doesn't warrant additional exploration and production of new gas. So, in order to incent the gas production, gas prices on the island have to rise and with our expectation that North American gas cost is not going up, that really puts Trinidad in a pretty marginal production place on the supply curve from a cost perspective. And so, it was the combination of challenges that we're having getting gas from the natural \u2013 or from NGC, Natural Gas Company, which is the government-controlled gas supplier and the likelihood that gas prices will go up that made us reevaluate our \u2013 the value of that asset and as such we took the decision that an impairment was in order given what our expectations are for the future of Trinidad and that's reflected in our financials.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Which, I'll just add, Dan, by the way I think that's a helpful development for the global SNB (36:28) balance on nitrogen, honestly, and it certainly is better for us because we have only one half of one ammonia plant in Trinidad and the rest of our 19 million tons of production sit elsewhere. So, to the extent you take a block out of the lower cost region and move it up to the high marginal cost region, that's good for everything else that sits down at the low end.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. Bert, if you had to estimate what fraction of the amount of nitrogen that will be consumed in the U.S., let's just say, to the first half that is either sitting in retail channel inventory right now or that you have sold forward versus the amount that you will sell spot, where would you put that split right now and how would that compare to a year ago level for mid-February?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I would put it exactly where I think it is and where we wanted to be which is where we have seen significant tonnage still to sell into Q2 and we're preparing for that. As I said earlier, we're utilizing our inventory and our options and running the plants at full speed. And so, where exactly the total is, I can't give you a specific number. We think the inventory position is lower and that coupled with an early spring, we look to possibly having an issue going into March of supply availability at the farm gate. And so, we're working to move tons into position and working with our customers both at being the retailer to have those into position for spring.","Again, going back to the low fall ammonia season, you still need to get those tons down, and that's we're seeing ammonia, as I said earlier, in Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma and Missouri going pretty full and pretty fast. And that could be another 10 days. And so, it allows farmers to get out and plant earlier and that probably will be in March in that region then you'll just stair-step up to the Upper Midwest. So, we're pretty positive for the spring.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","But, Bert, I mean, I think, it's fair to say right that we think we're well below or behind where last year was, a combination of lower tons that went down in the fall, lower imports thus far and the fact that the channel, we believe, is at a lower inventory rate suggests that there is an awful lot more buying and catching up that needs to happen in the first half of the year compared to what it's been historically at this time.","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","I agree.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just about these new plants in construction in Iran, could you have any intelligence on where they are at, whether or not they're going to be able to get gas to run those plants, and what's your expectations for supply, export, material out of that area?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. New plants seem to get announced fairly regularly and new plants fairly regularly do not get built. So, there is an issue today, and that we're receiving information on about Iran and their ability to load some of the commitments they have today. And the gas is there. Clearly, it's there and the ability to build the plant is there today and is that an economic good decision to make in today's market, that's for them to decide. I think what the problem is, is some of the publications that come out or the industry publications aren't as diligent in their analysis of what's possible and what's profitable. We've seen that from CRU on some of the estimates that have come out with plants that they have two plants in Russia coming on both the same plant, the same company, which is with a different name.","And so, you have to be really careful siphoning through some of these, again what's the reality based on what is not, and I think as we go forward in time, we're going to see fewer of these projected plants being built.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","And, Steve, one thing I would point to is, again, page 15 of our materials, there was a big slug of production that came on in 2016 in Iran. And those were two plants the Shiraz plant and the Pardis #3, those were both kind of in excess of 1 million tons a year. And then we expect another plant coming online in 2018, that's about a 1.2 million, the Oregon plant. And so, we do expect ongoing development, but what you don't see is any kind of significant activity out in 2019 and 2020 or 2021 right now and again if you're not engaging on the EPC contracts and beginning to sort of put in place the plants to start building one, you're not going to have another new plant, whether it's Iran or anywhere else starting up before kind of 2021 at this point. And so, that's why as we look forward and the tail of new plants really falls off very quickly, we're pretty optimistic about the longer-term kind of enduring nature of the recovery here going forward.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. In the quarter, there was a nice premium in your ammonia prices to NOLA prices, but there really wasn't a premium in urea or UAN. Can you talk about why that might be the case?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I'll focus on the urea and UAN. When we started the quarter, urea was at $180 FOB NOLA. As we roll through the quarter, I think it reached $240 at the end, but at the absolute end. And in the middle of that, we had the India tender and then the India cancellation of the tender. And so, urea was a pretty rocky story during the quarter, and our average price realization reflected that we had ton sold and committed as we rolled into the quarter. And we picked up some of that optionality as we finished the quarter. So, our average, I think, is appropriate.","UAN, the same story. The market hit a low in the \u2013 probably $130 short ton NOLA and kind of rose through the quarter, but UAN because we produce 22,000 tons, 23,000 tons a day throughout our system, that's a one week, like to stay ahead of, and that's why you see us utilize the export option because we can load 40,000 tons at a time. But we were at least a month or two sold on that product. And so, our price realization there in reflection of how low NOLA was in the absence of North American purchasing was acceptable.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. Jeff, that's the point that I will highlight again as Bert just mentioned which is \u2013 which you didn't see is the end market customers or the channel really taking inventory positions in the quarter and we brought on our new UAN production which is 6,000 tons a day at Donaldsonville. And so, that plant is going to be generating NOLA kind of price realization for that production especially when we exported as much as we did. And so, I would expect as you start seeing the channel move into taking inventory positions here as we're moving into the first half of the year and more of that buying is taking place in market, you'll start seeing some of that in market premium develop. But given where that huge amount of new capacity was added to D'ville and it gives us export optionality, that product really will trade at kind of NOLA pricing going forward.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's clear. In your outlook, you talked about the U.S. still meeting 7 million nutrient tons of imported nitrogen. How many nutrient tons of UAN do you think the U.S. now needs?","Bert A. Frost - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","It's a good question. We believe UAN is a wonderful product with optionality and versatility for a farmer for many different crops. I say that, because we think it's going to continue to grow and use. And so, when you look at the total picture, imports, our exports, and production flexibility that we often talk about that we can move between urea, ammonia and UAN and ammonia nitrate in Yazoo City. I do think the U.S. will continue to be an importing country of UAN. That volume will move from the \u2013 by peak of over 3 million tons to probably under or right at 1 million tons going forward. And where that will come from, a lot of it today is coming from Russia, Trinidad and like that.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","So, if you think somewhere around a million tons to 1.5 million tons, you're talking something like 300,000 nutrient tons to 500,000 nutrient tons is in the UAN.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay, good. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you and welcome to Martin Jarosick.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Indeed. Welcome, Martin, we're delighted to have you.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Thanks, John.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","And since you're growing your international business through exports, let me just ask about the reports that Yara has pulled out of the deal to buy Vale's nitrogen assets. Is it safe to say that doesn't fit with your strategy and even if it did, your balance sheet really doesn't allow you that flexibility?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I won't \u2013 or can't comment on what Yara is deciding to do, but we don't have a lot of interest in buying the production assets in Brazil. I think it's a very fair statement to say that it doesn't fit with our strategy.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, you highlighted the risk to the second half of 2017. Is it the risk of a narrow weather window, again, as the biggest risk or is it Chinese coal prices declining? Maybe you could just prioritize the risk for us, because I think we all know the capacity that will be there in the second half. So, what are the things that you think frame the scenarios?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I mean, I think the risk really comes in a couple of different flavors, one of which is, although it's not nearly to the same extent as happened in 2015 and 2016, we do believe that 2017 represents the last year where you end up with a little bit of excess new capacity coming online versus the normal demand growth. And as you said, we all kind of understand the capacity situation. The other risk that's in there is what happens with North American buyer behavior and do they exhibit the same sitting-on-their-hands situation in 2017 that they did in the third quarter of 2016, or have they learned something from what happened this year and will they get back in and actually buy at what amounts to be favorable pricing during the fill (48:29) season.","And so, I think it's really a question of when do you realize that value? Do you get it in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, or do we get it in the first quarter and second quarter of 2018? And that's why we're just a little bit uncertain in terms of \u2013 or think there is some risk out there around the back half of the year.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank.","Oliver Rowe - Scotiabank","This is Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. One of your peers recently hedged a portion of their gas play over the next few years and I know you've been reluctant to hedge since the last program. Just wondering if your stance on this has softened at all or what it would take to get you to restart hedging?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, our understanding is that \u2013 if you're talking about Agrium, our understanding is they were hedging Ecogas, which is at or below $2 per MMBtu. And look, Medicine Hat is one of the cheapest production assets that we have because it buys Ecogas. And we do look at whether it's hedging basis or doing other things like that around those plants. But we are big believers in the supply response in North America, the ability to deploy rigs and bring new supply on very quickly, and so when you saw gas prices spike during the fourth quarter, we were up in, what, almost $4.00 at one point; $3.93, I think, is where January settled. Today, natural gas is below $3.00, back at $2.91. And so, as you look at that, our need to get out there and really try to take a long-term hedge position when you know you're paying sort of an embedded vig is not \u2013 our appetite really isn't that high right now. Rig counts up 40% since the fourth quarter and I just \u2013 we feel very good about where North America sits in terms of its ability to bring on a lot of gas at a very attractive price for us.","Operator","Does that answer your question, Ben (sic) [Oliver]?","Oliver Rowe - Scotiabank","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Two questions, Tony. Do you think the value of pipelines is incrementally higher or lower than it was when we needed more imports? I'm just \u2013 I mean, obviously, you have the value of flexibility. But if we need to get less product into the Corn Belt, do you think that the value of a pipe is going down? And second, do you think your UK assets can be profitable in 2017?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, our UK assets were profitable in 2016. What we look at is kind of what is the cash generation on that business and, really, it's adjusted EBITDA that we focused on in terms of the UK. And we're really happy with kind of both what's the gas cost is, what the forward looks like, gas, for the UK and where selling prices are for ammonium nitrate. We've also done a really good job over there of renegotiating a bunch of the industrial contracts that we had for both ammonia and nitric acid supply that have added a lot of value to us in terms of that business versus where they were in 2015 and 2016. So, we're really pleased with the performance in the UK.","The \u2013 you were asking initially, Mark, about the value of pipeline capacity and what I'd say is \u2013 so, the inland pipeline is all ammonia. It's not UAN. And so, to the extent that farmers see value in terms of the discount per unit of nitrogen for applying ammonia, which they have historically done, then there will be ongoing value to be able to access and move ammonia into the interior and the pipeline is among the cheapest way to do that and the most secure way to do that. So, I think the pipeline network has ongoing significant value to the Ag sector in this country and we don't see that going away. And I know that with some of the upgrades that are going on at border entity in it, there may be less utilization on Magellan side of the pipe than there is on the NuStar, but the NuStar I think is pretty much full up. So, we don't really see any change \u2013 any real changes happening on the eastern pipe.","Dennis P. Kelleher - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah, Mark, I just want to make one more point about the ammonium nitrate business. If you look at ammonium nitrate business on an underlying basis and that's \u2013 both got stuck in the U.S. and also in the UK and you look at sort of gross margin, add back depreciation and amortization and also take out the effects of the derivatives. What you see is that the cash margin of that business is roughly around 20% for ammonium nitrate. If you look at the big three products, the same way over the past year in 2016, which obviously as we all know was a very challenging year, that cash margin sits well above 30%.","And I think what that points up is that sitting where we sit on the cost curve, with the gas advantage that we have, even in very, very challenging years as 2016 was, that cost advantage comes through and from a cash perspective and economic perspective makes the business cash positive and very profitable.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","That's really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, good morning. Can you give us a sense of what utilization the different Port Neal plants ran at in Q4 and in Q1 and then also generally in 2017? So, when you think you will reach full capacity at Port Neal? Thanks.","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Yeah. So, the ammonia plant at Port Neal is running at a 110%-ish of nameplate right now. So, I would say we're well past full capacity at the moment. The urea plant has run about at \u2013 is running about at nameplate and it's a little bit like happened at Donaldsonville because it's a sister plant to the D'ville plant which is we brought it up to nameplate and then continued to step it up over the next couple of months and ultimately where the D'ville plant is currently operating is between about 10% and 15% above the nameplate. And so, we expect to get the same kind of performance out of the Port Neal urea plant here as we go through kind of the balance of the first quarter into the early second quarter. But that plant is fully operational and \u2013 at or above nameplate.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thanks for that. So, is the strategy now I'm seeing your capital allocation the last few slide in your presentation, with the strategy to be here to basically sit on your big pile of cash here through the $800 million of debt maturities in May 2018, is that \u2013 and sort of ride it out and see what will happen next year. Is that basically the idea?","W. Anthony Will - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","Well, I mean we do have the opportunity to do a natural kind of de-levering in 2018. I would say we have got roughly $800 million coming in from the tax refund that we expect due to bonus depreciation. We've got $800 million going out the door, so in a lot of way, in terms of the debt repayment. So, in a lot of ways that debt repayment has been kind of fully funded at this point, we just don't have the cash in the door yet. So, we certainly feel much better about what we see looking ahead than where we were in the third quarter and fourth quarter, but one of the things that we are focused on is maintaining investment grade metrics over the long-term. And so, we want to make sure that everything is sorted in the appropriate place before we start thinking too hard about future deployment.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Thanks.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions for today. I would like to turn the call back to Martin Jarosick for closing remarks.","Martin A. Jarosick - CF Industries Holdings, Inc.","That concludes our fourth quarter earnings call. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out. Thanks for everyone's time today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may all disconnect."]}}
