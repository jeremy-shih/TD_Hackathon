Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.","The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you, the viewer, and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com.","At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation.","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis third quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.","For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 2, 2016. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. There's been a lot written lately about the animal health industry, livestock, in particular, and the cycles we face as a part of the global food supply chain.","Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with the positive result we have reported in the third quarter because it reaffirms that we understand the cycles of our customers' businesses. And as in the past, we continue to be resilient in our ability to adapt and steadily grow our business, despite the broader agricultural market changes.","At Zoetis, we have regularly grown faster than the market, and we are very well positioned to achieve predictable growth during these cycles because of our diverse portfolio and global scope. We remain focused on the long-term full-year review of our business since quarterly results can be misleading about the cycles in our customers' markets. Our strength in all relevant geographies, species, and therapeutic areas help us offset many of the economic and business challenges that can affect part of the animal health industry in the near term.","We're also making improvements in our cost structure and reallocating resources to the most important growth opportunities in animal health from a therapeutic area and geographical perspective. I'm pleased to say, we have nearly completed our operational efficiency initiative, and we can confirm that we expect to achieve the target of $300 million in cost savings by the end of 2017. We also now expect to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% to 35% in 2017, higher than our original projection, and we expect to grow our revenues faster than the market again in 2017.","This quarter, we delivered strong results. We grew our revenue 4% operationally, with particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. When you exclude the impact of our operational efficiency initiative, foreign exchange, and acquisitions, or what we call normalized organic operational growth, our growth in the third quarter was 6%.","On the same normalized basis, our companion animal products grew 11% and our livestock products grew 2%. The companion animal growth was driven by a full supply of APOQUEL and the introduction of other new products.","And in livestock, the main driver of growth was strength in our international markets, which were able to offset the impact of product rationalization changes across the livestock portfolio. Moving forward, we expect companion animal to be the main contributor to growth in the fourth quarter and in 2017. And in terms of livestock, we expect improved growth as we get beyond the product rationalization impacts this year.","Moving on to earnings, we grew adjusted earnings 6% operationally, reflecting the negative impact of higher adjusted effective tax rate. Glenn will discuss this in more detail. But, excluding tax and interest, our EBIT growth was 17%.","As we finish up 2016, we are increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to reflect the strong performance we have achieved through the first nine months of the year. And based on the monthly (sic) [continued] trends we see and the confidence in our business, we are also improving our guidance for 2017, despite the recent negative evolution of currencies compared to the U.S. dollar.","Let me provide additional business updates on some key products and discuss the investments we are making to support that growth. For the first nine months of 2016, we have generated approximately $180 million in revenue for APOQUEL, with about $70 million coming in the third quarter. We have here an excellent response from veterinarians and pet owners using APOQUEL, as we increase our penetration in new markets. Our research indicates that we are achieving great awareness and satisfaction among veterinarians, as well as more frequent proactive requests from pet owners.","APOQUEL has now been launched with unrestricted supply in all approved markets. And we are working on further expanding its market share. In the U.S., we have seen growth of new patients since achieving full supply in May. APOQUEL has been doing very well in treating dogs with chronic allergies. And we are increasingly seeing it used for more seasonal and acute allergy causes, an important part of our expansion plans.","As we look ahead with APOQUEL, we are trying additional ways to support this product growth. For example, in the U.S., we are developing and testing direct-to-consumer, or DTC, advertising and we expect to launch a national advertising campaign for APOQUEL in 2017.","Also to support the growth of our companion animal business, we have also been expanding our product portfolios and field force in China and Brazil. These are great examples on how our efficiency initiative is ultimately about better allocating resources to generate sales growth.","Meanwhile, Simparica, our new oral parasiticide for dogs, is available in the U.S. and most of the EU countries, and is being further deployed in markets like Canada and Brazil. In 2017, Simparica will be available for the full flea and tick season in the U.S. and EU. We are planning to support Simparica with additional promotional investment to ensure it has a positive impact in our revenue growth in 2017.","We are also getting ready for the broader launch of our canine antibody therapy, targeting IL-31. This therapy is currently only available in the U.S. under conditional license. And in October, we expanded our efforts beyond dermatology specialists and made it available to all veterinarians in the U.S. We'll broaden distribution in the weeks ahead and we expect to achieve a full USDA license by the end of the year, with Europe to follow next year.","We are also seeing good progress with the PHARMAQ acquisition that we made one year ago. We have posted $64 million in fish revenue through the first nine months of the year, despite the toxic algae bloom that has been impacting fish farmers in Chile. PHARMAQ has achieved rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for farmers in Chile. Fish farmers who needed a more predictable and reliable means of protection have responded very favorably to recent information that LiVac SRS has already demonstrated protection up to 11 months after vaccination, and we continue testing for longer duration of efficacy. Fish farmers also view this vaccine as an important way to reduce the use of antibiotics in their operations.","Now, let me turn to the R&D innovations that continue supporting our future growth and value creation. New product introductions like APOQUEL, the IL-31 antibody therapy, Simparica and the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine are very important. And continuous innovation over the lifecycle of our products is also critical to our long-term success.","In the third quarter, we had several approvals of new indications and formulations for key livestock products. In swine, we obtained approvals in the U.S. for new combinations of our FLUSURE XP vaccine. This now helps guard against additional flu strains that threaten swine herd health. We also expanded our FOSTERA swine vaccine with additional indications and approvals in markets like Brazil, Mexico and Korea. Our premium injectable anti-infective DRAXXIN received additional indications and approvals in Japan and Canada. We also obtained approval in Japan for BOPRIVA, a unique vaccine that temporarily reduce testosterone in bulls, providing farmers with a highly-effective way to manage aggressive behavior.","We're also making investment and showing progress in our diagnostic portfolio. In August, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices or SMB. They are pioneers in developing the manufacturing microfluidic lab on a chip diagnostic products, which are used for veterinary point-of-care services. SMB's promising product line has helped our existing diagnostic business, which obtained approval for values and test kits in the third quarter in new markets such as Mexico, Japan and Korea. Lots of good news to share about our new products, lifecycle innovation and business development activities.","In summary, we have continued to demonstrate the strength of our diverse portfolio across geographies and species. And this time, we see particular strength in our companion animal portfolio. We are realizing the benefits of a disciplined approach to R&D and business development, which is strengthening our business for the long term. And we expect to achieve our operational efficiency initiative target in 2017 and set ourselves on a path to increase profitability, cash generation and value creation, while maintaining our revenue growth.","With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Before I get into the financials, I wanted to thank many of you for reaching out and speaking with me since I became CFO in August. I'm very excited to take on this role and work with the rest of Zoetis' leaders to continue driving the performance of our company. As CFO, I am committed to maintaining our reputation for financial integrity and transparency and continuing an ongoing dialogue with the investment community.","We remain focused on achieving our updated financial guidance for 2016 and 2017, building our capacity for long-term revenue and earnings growth, and delivering the innovations and financial performance that people have come to expect from Zoetis.","I am pleased to say that in my first quarter as CFO that we are making excellent progress on all those fronts, and we are raising our earnings guidance for 2016 and improving our earnings guidance for 2017, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, which was approximately $0.03. The consistent performance we've delivered over time through recent periods of major efficiency initiatives and change is a testament to the quality and commitment of our Zoetis colleagues.","So, what are the key takeaways for the third quarter results? Continued strong operational revenue growth from our diverse portfolio, continued improvement in our adjusted EBIT growth and margin, a meaningful contribution from several new product launches, lifecycle innovations and targeted business development activities, and finally, an updated guidance for 2016 and 2017 that reflects our recent performance and confidence in the future.","Now, let me walk you through the major pieces of our third quarter income statement and provide some color. We generally talk to operational growth, which excludes the impacts of foreign currency. You can also see, once again, in the tables on our website that we are providing additional detail on impacts related to our operational efficiency initiatives, M&A, and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year. We refer to the revenue growth excluding these items as normalized organic operational growth. For the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 4%, which excludes the 2% negative impact of foreign exchange.","Now, let me take you through the key elements of our performance and bridge that to our normalized growth. First, APOQUEL and a number of other new products contributed 5% of our revenue growth. The in-line portfolio grew 1%, with price contributing 2% and volume declining 1%. Recent M&A contributed 3% to our growth, while our operational efficiency initiative reduced our growth by 5%, due to product rationalizations and changes to our business in markets like Venezuela and India.","Accounting for all of these factors, we delivered normalized organic operational growth of 6% in the quarter. And for the first nine months of the year, our revenue growth on this basis was 7%, in line with our view of 7% to 8% growth for the full year.","Turning now to our segment performance; in terms of the U.S., we generated 1% operational growth compared to a very strong third quarter in the previous year. Just a reminder, the U.S. grew 19% in Q3 2015, with livestock growing 13% and companion animal growing 27%. In the third quarter of 2016, U.S. companion animal products grew 5%, driven by APOQUEL, Simparica and other new product launches like our new vaccines. This growth was partially offset by a decline in surgical fluid products.","In U.S. livestock, we declined by 2% against the very strong year-ago quarter when we grew 13%. The decline was primarily due to the impact of SKU eliminations, lower sales of our swine products, where we continue to see increased competition, as well as the impact of a challenging market environment, especially for our cattle and swine customers. We partially offset this decline with growth in our cattle business, where successful promotional activity drove increased volumes. Shifting back to a normalized organic operational growth basis, U.S. grew 3% with companion animal growing 6% and livestock growing 1%.","Turning to International, revenue grew 6% operationally. We delivered very strong operational growth of 15% in companion animal and 2% in livestock. Our International business saw a significant impact from our operational efficiency initiatives, which reduced growth by 8%. By species group, the impact was 9% in livestock and 6% in companion animal. M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 5% to our International revenue growth. Based on these factors, our normalized organic operational growth for International was 9%, with companion animal growth of 21% and livestock growth of 4%.","You can see the full results for our top 11 markets in the table, so let me highlight a few items. Growth in markets like Japan, Brazil, Germany and Australia was primarily from companion animal products and launches of APOQUEL. In Japan, we saw a significant benefit from the initial stocking of APOQUEL with wholesalers in the quarter. France and Canada both saw a mix of companion animal and livestock sales driving their growth, including sales of APOQUEL and a more stable environment in France around antibiotic usage and prior regulatory changes.","Meanwhile, we continue to see livestock supported with growth in cattle in Brazil and swine in China, where we currently have favorable market conditions, as well as growth in companion animal in China, where we are seeing positive trends in medicalization rates for pets. Overall, we have been very pleased with the strong growth we have seen in emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, where we have invested in expanding our field force and product portfolios to effectively capitalize on the fast-growing trends in these countries. We'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers, combined with high returns on our investments.","Wrapping up the revenue picture, there are five key takeaways for the third quarter. Our diversified model continues to deliver steady, predictable and meaningful revenue growth, with strong product lines and geographies balancing the effect of certain market challenges and cycles.","Product rationalization continues to impact revenue growth. However, we continue to deliver strong growth on a normalized basis. APOQUEL once again was a significant growth driver, with launches in new markets and continued expansion of the customer base in existing markets.","Other companion animal products, like Simparica and recent additions to our vaccine portfolio, are contributing to growth. And finally, when it comes to revenue, we are improving the base business in various emerging markets by expanding our product portfolio and adding to our direct sales capability.","Turning to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin improved 120 basis points, primarily due to a more profitable mix of products, while foreign exchange had a negative impact of 70 basis points this quarter. Adjusted operating expense also declined, reflecting the continued realization of our operational efficiency changes and continued discipline around SG&A, which includes the addition of PHARMAQ expenses this year.","Improved gross margin and a reduction in operating expenses enabled us to grow our adjusted EBIT by 17% operationally, versus the 4% operational revenue growth.","Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.6% versus 25.1% in the year-ago quarter. This difference was primarily driven by the impact of the European Commission tax ruling earlier this year, and the benefit of certain discrete items in the year-ago quarter.","As a result, adjusted net income grew 6% operationally, reflecting the change to our adjusted tax rate and higher interest expense, which offset much of our adjusted EBIT growth. For the quarter, GAAP net income grew 26% on a reported basis, aided by a reduction in stand-up costs and restructuring charges, as well as the revaluation of deferred tax assets related to the establishment of our new International operating model.","Moving to guidance for full-year 2016, we are narrowing to the high end of our revenue range, and increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to reflect our ongoing confidence in the momentum of our new products and the sustainable cost benefits of our operational efficiency initiative.","As you model out the remainder of 2016, remember that we have five fewer days in Q4 2016 than Q4 2015. And this is usually our highest quarter in terms of operating expenses as a percent of revenue, and our lowest quarter for gross margin, due to the seasonal nature of our product mix.","For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth, including the impact from product rationalization, of 4% to 5%, and adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 32%, and operational growth and adjusted net income of 12% to 15%.","The significant increase in our guidance for reported diluted EPS is due to our increased outlook for the business and the favorable tax items realized in Q3.","Moving to 2017; since our last update in August, changes in FX rates have lowered our views for revenue by $50 million and adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03. However, the overall evolution in our business over the past year has been positive on balance, as our companion animal dermatology portfolio continues to grow and several livestock markets in our International business are strengthening.","These changes are allowing us to increase the lower end of our revenue range and maintaining the high end, while absorbing the negative impact of foreign exchange. Cost of goods remains the same at 32% to 33% as we have been successful in our cost reduction efforts, as well as our SKU rationalization that has brought an improved mix.","On SG&A, FX changes were slightly in our favor. However, we are increasing the lower end of our range and maintaining the high end as we allocate a portion of our cost savings to promising investment opportunities, such as, advertising and promotion investments in key companion animal franchises like APOQUEL and Simparica that will drive revenue starting in 2017 and over the next several years.","Field force expansions in Brazil and China where we see sustainable growth drivers and opportunities for increased market share, and enhancements to our diagnostics commercial capabilities following the acquisition of SMB. We're also taking on the necessary R&D investments to develop SMB's pipeline, as well as investing additional R&D dollars to some of our key international growth markets. When you take all of these changes together, we are increasing the lower end of our adjusted EPS range, maintaining the high end of $2.38, despite the negative impact of foreign currency, while also improving our view for adjusted EBIT margin to be between 34% and 35%.","While we don't provide quarterly guidance, we do want to point out that we are currently expecting the delivery of full-year 2017 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year for a few reasons. First, we will have some lingering effects from the operational efficiency initiative in the first two quarters as we continue to sell out remaining inventory in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. Second, a portion of our revenue growth is dependent upon the ramping up of new product launches, which we expect to build throughout the year. Finally, many of the incremental investments we are making on the SG&A line are weighted towards the first half of the year and begin to deliver results on the revenue line as the year goes on.","A final point on capital allocation; we are continuing to repurchase shares at a steady rate of $75 million per quarter. At this rate, we'd exhaust our current plan at the end of this year. Share repurchases will continue to be an important element of our capital allocation framework and we will provide a more specific update later this year.","So wrapping up; we've improved our outlook for revenue. We've achieved our targeted cost structure. We're prudently taking on investments in long-term growth. We've improved our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin and we've improved our view for EPS. There's been a tremendous effort to get where we are. We're proud of what we've achieved to-date and we are excited to continue to move the business to new heights.","With that, I'll hand it over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question here is on livestock. How should we think about Zoetis' ability to grow livestock sales through pricing pressures in the U.S. for cattle? And can you provide more details on the herd size, U.S. feed lot sales, and producer profitability and the puts and takes here? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Louise. It's Juan Ram\u00f3n. Well, on the question on the livestock and how we plan to grow this business in price or other volume growth, definitely, we'll continue applying the same strategy in terms of pricing that can be justified through outcome and providing the value to our customers. We continue having these prices vary constantly over the years, and we also plan to continue increasing these prices in the future.","In the U.S., as we reported, livestock in this quarter grew by 1% in terms of normalized growth, so excluding the impact of SKU or currency or M&A. If we go to the sales of \u2013 in light of this growth, cattle grew by low-single digit, swine declined and poultry have double-digit growth.","So, talking about the cattle and also the situation on the feed lots and all different drivers that are affecting this segment, so let me describe the factors that are impacting the cattle business in the U.S. So, one, it's more animals, which is positive. We have seen also in this quarter higher placement of animals in feed lots, another positive element. But there are other elements, which are negative and we have seen that in the quarter.","So, first, the producers are losing money. Animals are entering heavier into the feed lots. And also, we have experiencing mild weather conditions in the U.S. that are driving a lower-disease incident. So, net-net, compared to one year ago, we think that the situation is less positive. But still, with this situation, we have been able to grow the business and the reason why we are growing is because of our portfolio, the ability also to increase prices and also the team, which is interacting with customers.","The last comment I want to make here is that this is a business, livestock, which is affected by cycles. Cycles that have been affecting in the past, and will continue affecting in the future. Despite these cycles, the animal health industry has been very resilient and they're showing very steady growth. In the past, that's 5% to 6% and we expect also in the future despite of those cycles we will continue growing at the same rate. And definitely, we see Zoetis also growing in 2017 in livestock in line with the market.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question with Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. And maybe I'll just try to ask both questions upfront, so the first one on APOQUEL. I think it's now $280 million run rate before the DTC. So, how do you feel about that north of $300 million goal? Is that now possibly $400 million? And maybe if you can talk about what prior DTCs have done to other Zoetis products, like Rimadyl.","And then just a follow-up on the U.S. livestock; you mentioned you're up 1% after the adjustments in the SKU rationalization. In the comments, I think you called out some promotions in the quarter. So just wondering, is the thought of positive U.S. livestock growth for the year still intact? Just trying to get the fluctuations between 3Q and 4Q. Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jon for the question. On APOQUEL, we expect definitely to exceed that $300 million. We want to make sure that we have full understanding of the market reaction not only in the U.S., but also in all the rest of the markets in the product has been now made available that \u2013 with full availability. We also need to have a full understanding of what will be the impact not only in chronic, but also in seasonal and acute. And we said that DTC campaign, definitely, we expect to broaden the access of \u2013 or expanding the access of the product to more patients and also bring pet owners to the clinics then the veterinarians then can prescribe the product.","In terms of other DTC investments, we mentioned also that we are considering also DTC for Simparica. It's something that we will consider in the U.S. when we have the right level of penetration in the market.","In terms of cattle; so cattle in the U.S., we expect that at the end of the year, we'll be growing and we insisted many times that it's important not to look at our business on a quarterly basis, but on a full-year basis. And in full-year basis, we still expect the cattle business showing positive growth. And we know that some cycles that can be negative at certain point will turn into positive in the following phases or the following quarters or months. So, we are confident also that the cattle business in the U.S. will be showing growth in 2017.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","And this is Glenn. And just to add on to APOQUEL in terms of the DTC. Since we don't have a lot of experience with DTC with a lot of our other products, we did run specific pilots for APOQUEL that give us strong confidence in the return that we're going to get that investment in the future.","And then the other thing in terms of the peak sale, we really do want to stress to look at that from a dermatology portfolio perspective. We're very excited about IL-31 in the future that that's going to bring for us.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much for taking my question. Just for Glenn, I wonder if you can just tell us around some of the inventory management you have. You have the SKU focus. You quite clearly guided for that in 2017. Could you just tell us if there could be further inventory movements from the integration of SAP and is that included in the 2017 guide?","And then just quick add-on of you noticed \u2013 you mentioned an update on the share repurchase, would that be part of our Capital Markets Day later this year? Thank you.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So from an inventory perspective, we definitely still do see significant opportunity to reduce our inventory moving forward. We currently sit at 10 plus months of inventory on the balance sheet and that's definitely an area of opportunity that we see. And we'll start to see benefits from the additional visibility we have in SAP. We'll start to see those benefits in 2017 and beyond, so definitely an area of opportunity for us to increase our cash generation.","The other question in terms of share repurchase, so we have a $500 million share repurchase program in place that started last year. We'll be complete with that program by the end of the year, and we'll come back to the market later in the year with our intentions for that moving forward. But share repurchase does remain a very important part of our capital allocation priorities.","Operator","And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Good morning.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Could you talk a little bit about the swine business, and how much of a headwind has that been to organic revenue growth the last year or so? And I guess, when can we think about new product timing and concentrations of that? I mean just talk a little bit more about how you are thinking about rebuilding that business, or expanding that business.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes. And let me describe the swine business, not only in the U.S., but also International. Internationally, the swine business has been showing double-digit growth, which is very strong growth. While in the U.S., we saw in this quarter, a decline. The main reason of this decline was some challenge in terms of one important vaccine that is used in the swine industry, which is the PCV2 vaccine. We expect to update this vaccine, and having a positive impact in terms of growth in 2017. The rest of the markets outside of the U.S., the performance has been very strong, especially in China, where we continue seeing the benefits of more sophistication of the swine production (39:16). And we are very well positioned to maximize the opportunities in this (39:21) market. We also \u2013 after we explain that, we are expanding our portfolio and field force in the country, in China. And definitely, we see swine generating net growth in 2017.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Scotti with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","John Scotti - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask on operating margin, because given the increase in 2017 guidance; Glenn, in your new seat, would appreciate any thoughts on where you see operating margin growth beyond 35%? And specifically, where do you think the upper bound of operating margin expansion is? Is above 40% realistic here?","And then also, can you comment specifically on the contribution of the manufacturing initiative in future years? And then really fast, sorry, just a follow-up on APOQUEL. You mentioned you plan to exceed $300 million, can you provide any detail on timelines for that? Is that a 2017 event? Thank you.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of the $300 million, I'll take that question first, that is a 2017 event. Exceeding the $300 million is baked in to our projection for 2017. In terms of operating margin, so we're not targeting a specific operating margin going forward. We're really focused on income generation and cash generation, and that is our focus. However, when you look at what we articulate as our long-term strategy, the ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than our costs, that definitely does lead to increased margins as we move forward.","And in terms of the benefit that we expect to get from the supply network strategy moving forward, so we have articulated and we're still committed to, by 2020, we do expect to achieve an extra 200 basis points improvement in our margin from that strategy. So, when you take all of those factors together, that definitely leads to improved margin. But again, our focus is on cash generation.","Operator","And the next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning. This is Jonathan (41:21) on the call for Jami. So, if protein prices continue to fall and are sustained at lower levels as a result of your cyclical factors, would that potentially cause you to revise your expectations, particularly in cattle and swine?","And a second question, some of your competitors have cited challenges in their dairy segment, and given that you discuss cattle as a consolidated figure, I was hoping that you could comment on trends seen in that particular group?","And further, can you elaborate on the progress of the SKU rationalization program and when that will begin tapering off, and whether you will see operational growth in U.S. livestock remain positive, net of these rationalizations? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you for your questions. Hi, Jonathan (42:02). Let me start with the comment on the protein pricing and how this can be affecting our business. So, we have seen that these prices are going up and down, it is part of cycles that has been affecting our industry for decades. And we have been managing that very well, this situation. We saw prices going down for poultry, and then the next cycle, going up. It always depend on the supply. The demand continue growing, and it is something that will help the industry to continue generating more revenues.","We don't think that the current situation is specifically negative. It's something that we expect that there will be a reverse in the near future. And we will see that this is not having a negative impact in our projections. And, again, so this industry (43:11) has been very predictable and showing steady growth, even in situations with significant negative factors, including the drought or even including the economic crisis in 2008, the animal health industry was probably one of the few industries showing growth in this negative environment.","Dairy, we have seen that the prices of dairy has been down significantly at the beginning of the year. Now these prices are recovering, and very important is that we have not seen any reduction of a herd in terms of cows, which is an indication that producers are still keeping the animals to ensure that they will be able to supply market demands in the next cycle. So, we expect also dairy having a positive trend in 2017.","And then, Glenn will talk about the SKU rationalization.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","In terms of the SKU rationalization, we are essentially complete with that program. However, we did have some sales of these products in Q1 and Q2 of 2016. That does pose a challenge in the comparative for 2017. We estimate that impact to be about 1% for 2017 and more disproportionately weighted to the first half of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Glenn, can you expand a bit more on the supply chain optimization plan? You've talked in the past about a couple hundred basis points goal, but could you maybe just lay out a little more specifically, the timeline and the strategy to get there? And then secondly can you give us an update on how the livestock antibiotic portfolio did in the quarter? Thanks.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of the supply chain optimization, there are a number of sites that we're still in the process of divesting or changing our strategy in three sites essentially that will need to ship product from one site to another. That occurs over time. So the progression of that 200 basis points improvement that we talked about through 2020 will come over a number of years. You'll see that in 2018, 2019, and 2020. It won't be an automatic shift. It's based on the timing of shifting the products of the \u2013 from those three plants.","In terms of livestock antibiotic growth year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth year-to-date in those products. There are some shifts with M&A \u2013 within MFA. But overall, our antibiotics are growing year-to-date.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Frank DiLorenzo - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning. This is Frank DiLorenzo on behalf of Alex. Thanks for taking my call. Regarding business development, will management continue to look towards small opportunities such as the recent Scandinavian Micro Biodevices deal, or are you willing to consider larger deals. Also along those lines, are there any particular areas of interest that you are focusing on? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, we are not limiting our target in terms of M&A to small acquisitions. What we are targeting is a business that will support our strategy and also will create value. And I think we have significant experience in integrating companies. We think that any acquisition that is supported by the strategy and the value creation will generate synergies in terms of costs and also revenues. We are also defining what are the areas of interest for M&A. We will continue assessing opportunities in our core business. But also, we will consider in diagnostics also in genetics, and in devices, as a way to complement our portfolio and maximize the already existing infrastructure that we have that we will be using these products also to deliver even higher value to our customers.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. Two questions, first on APOQUEL, I think you've talked in the past that the APOQUEL sales have been largely three-quarters U.S. and one quarter O-U.S. How has that shifted and how do you see that trending going forward? And also on APOQUEL, are you able to tell us how many dogs in the U.S. have been treated with APOQUEL so far?","And then secondly just a broader question on pricing trends, as you look into 2017, can you remind us what you're pricing expectations are, both U.S. and O-U.S. and whether there's been any change from 2016? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Let me start with the comment on prices. So, on prices, we are consistent also with the animal health projections. And the animal health projections is growing prices 2% to 3%. And this has been always very consistent in the past, and we'll continue applying this 2% to 3% in our projections. And we expect that 2017 also will be in line with these percentages. Not too big difference in terms of U.S. or international. The only difference in some international markets with high inflation rates, the price increases can be higher and in line with this inflation.","You also asked about the use of APOQUEL in the U.S. mainly. And well, so far, until very recently, the use of APOQUEL has been mostly focused on chronic. We have seen already in this quarter that it's already APOQUEL in the U.S., which is where we have more recent market research. The use has been also extended to seasonal and chronic and acute. And we expect also this to continue not only in the U.S., but also in the international markets. And we are very confident that the expansion of the products will be driven by the use in all the different categories; chronic, acute and seasonal.","You also asked about what is the division of APOQUEL U.S.-international. Well, this quarter, on the $70 million, $40 million came from the U.S. and $30 million international. This is something that is probably not representative of the full potential of international and the U.S.","What we can also show in the market through market research is that the new patients is growing constantly in the U.S., which is very positive, and we expect that this will continue. And if the results of the pilot is showing positive for the DTC that we are testing in the U.S., then we expect that this will be also accelerating the use of APOQUEL in the U.S.","As you know, not in all markets that DTC is available because there are some restrictions in terms of regulatory for direct-to-consumer advertising in many markets in the world.","Operator","And we'll take a follow-up from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thanks. This is Mike (51:10) on for Derik just with a quick follow up. In the last couple of months there's been a lot of movements in the competitive landscape with companies moving ahead with proposed asset swaps, some divestitures. Can you talk a little bit about how have you seen any change in the competitive landscape, if you've been able to gain any share, and especially in the last quarter there was a lot of mixed results from competitors, particularly in companion animal in the U.S. Some promotional changes with flea and tick; can you just talk about if you've been able to capitalize on any of those disruptions in the market?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, let me start saying that we believe that we have the best portfolio in animal health industry in both companion animal and livestock. We have significant new products launch recently, and also very important our R&D investment in our current portfolio is also showing very positive results. So, we don't think that the consolidation of the industry that will be taking place from now until the end of the year will change that significantly the competitive landscape. We compete not on a global basis, but also on a country basis and also on species basis.","And there are not too significant difference because of this consolidation. So, we are very confident that we remain very competitive, and the products that we are introducing and also this report in terms of promotional activities and R&D and even manufacturing quality and delay of supply will help us to maintain and expand our market share.","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions at this time. I will return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said, we reported very strong results in the quarter. We are very confident on the projections that we are making for 2016 and 2017. And we'll connect again in the next earnings release. So, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And this will conclude today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.","John O'Connor","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Senior Vice President of Finance Operations and Acting Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Glenn will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of today's slides and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including our recent 10-K and 10-Qs.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, such as the nonrecurring cost of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today August 5, 2014. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","I also want to remind you that beginning last quarter, we realigned our segment reporting with respect to our Client Supply Services organization, or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, John, and thank you to those joining us for today's call. I would like to start by sharing high-level details of our performance for the second quarter. During this period, we delivered operational growth of 6% in revenues and 11% in adjusted net income or adjusted diluted EPS of $0.38. We also delivered operational revenue growth across each of our geographical segments in the quarter, reflecting the strength and balance of our diverse portfolio. This illustrates that our continued focus on building strong customer relationships, bringing new products to the market, while managing the product lifecycles and producing high-quality products and reliable supply, all remain fundamental strengths of our business and model.","Let me now comment on the performance of our business by species. The performance of our livestock segment grew by 9%. Here, we see more favorable market conditions for many of our customers across the globe. Overall, worldwide demand for meat protein continues increasing, especially in emerging markets. In these markets, their objective is to increase their local production. But to meet their needs, they still depend on key export markets, such as the U.S. and Brazil, where we also have a significant presence.","Additionally, feed costs continue to moderate for our customers. Nevertheless, conditions will remain difficult for some producers in certain markets in Asia Pacific and in Europe. And factors such as disease outbreaks and climate conditions are placing some limitations on how quickly our customers can expand protein production. These conditions reinforce the value of our medicines and technology for more efficient production. As producers work to supply greater volumes of meat protein by increasing cattle and swine slaughter weights, we expect to see continued strong demand for our products. Our global presence and breadth of portfolio positions -- so it is well to capitalize on these positive trends.","Let me take a deeper dive into some of these individual species, starting with cattle, which grew 10% operationally. We delivered strong growth in all regions, most notably in the Canada\/Latin American region, where we implemented new pricing strategies in a number of Latin American countries. Poultry delivered operational growth of 11%. All regions contributed to these, but particular in the U.S., where sales of our medicated feed additives and also vaccines delivered double-digit growth.","In swine, PEDv has continued to spread, not only in the U.S., but also in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and a number of other countries. The virus is reducing the size of swine herds, and producers are working to offset these reductions by raising higher-weight animals.","Additionally, our business has felt the impact of antibiotic regulations in Europe. In spite of these conditions, Zoetis is still the leader, based on growth of 5% in swine, thanks to introduction of new products.","Moving now on to companion animal. We delivered 2% operational growth in the quarter. Sales of our canine product APOQUEL contributed to the growth in this sector, even as we continue to address our levels of supply for this product. I will talk a little bit more about APOQUEL later on this call.","Overall, while growth fundamentals for companion animal remains strong in all countries, and particularly in emerging markets, we have seen an increase in competition in many of our larger developed markets. This is primarily from new product introductions in parasiticides and in vaccines. We are confident that the breadth of our portfolio, including new product launches, as well as the strength of our field force and our world-class capabilities in R&D, will enable us to stay competitive in this market.","Across our business, we continue to see that the depth and the diversity of our portfolio plays a critical role in the overall performance of our company and also sustain our competitive advantage.","The depth and diversity is demonstrated by our portfolio for multiple species across 5 therapeutic areas and by the 300 products marketed in 120 countries. As a result of this quarter's performance, and our forecast for the rest of the year, we are increasing the lower end of our guidance range for revenue, adjusted EPS and SG&A for the full year.","Now, I would like to provide an update on our portfolio, and in particular, highlight our R&D progress and the latest for APOQUEL. Earlier, I spoke about the impact of PEDv on our business. Now, let me share with you some details of the progress that we are making on developing a vaccine for this disease, where we have 2 programs. Our most advanced program is for an inactivated or kill vaccine. On this, we are working closely with the USDA and expect to request approval for a conditional license in 2014. Following any approval, we anticipate that we will be able to supply the markets soon after.","We also continued our work with Iowa State University on an additional vaccine approach. We are making good progress and will provide updates of this program as the research evolves.","Finally, we continue working with the University of Minnesota for a PEDv diagnostic test and this type of test will help producers to rapidly identify potential infections in their herds. The result from these research programs will also have applicability outside of the U.S. We are exploring regulatory approaches to enhance the reach of these potential products in all the affected markets.","This quarter, we secured regulatory approval and launched ACTOGAIN. This ractopamine product for the use in cattle, alone or in combination with other commonly used medicated feed additives. This in addition to our already-strong cattle portfolio. The approval of ACTOGAIN builds on the success of the launch of ENGAIN, also a ractopamine product, which was approved and recently launched for use in swine. Both ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN are performing better than expected. This performance is in part driven by the removal of a competing product from the market.","And finally, to our progress with APOQUEL. As you will remember, this is an innovative medicine designed to relieve dogs from pruritus. We launched the product in the U.S. and in a number of European markets early this year and have seen significant levels of customer demand for the product. This has resulted in a supply shortage. Our priorities at this point are to ensure that dogs currently being treated with APOQUEL continue to receive their product without interruption and to normalize the product supply as soon as possible.","As noted on our last call, the process to produce APOQUEL is complex. We are working to reduce the length of time it takes to manufacture the product and to add manufacturing capacity. By April, next year, we expect to significantly increase the supply of APOQUEL, and as a result, we'll be able to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers.","Based on our current market demand, the introduction of the product in new markets, and our plans to increase supply, we now expect the product to generate in excess of $100 million in revenues next year.","And before I ask Glenn to walk us through the financials, I would like to highlight our coming Investor Day. This will take place on November 18 at The New York Stock Exchange. We're very excited to be able to host this event and look forward to having the opportunity to share with you more details of our strategy, capabilities and value propositions, as well as the overall animal healthcare industry.","And with that, Glenn?","Glenn David","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Let me start today with a review of the second quarter results and then discuss our guidance for full year 2015.","Turning first to the income statement slide. For the second quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of 2 percentage points on revenue, primarily due to the impact of currencies in Brazil, Australia, Argentina and Canada, which were partially offset by improvements in the euro and sterling. As a result, operational growth, excluding the impact of currency, was 6%.","Reported net income was $136 million or $0.27 per diluted share, and adjusted net income was $189 million or $0.38 per diluted share, representing growth of 6% on a reported basis and 11% operationally. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $53 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to stand-up cost.","Certain significant items this quarter also include a one-time charge related to a commercial settlement with customers in Mexico. This settlement is with several of our large poultry customers in Mexico. It is associated with certain shipments from specific lots of poultry vaccine products, and we have moved ahead with a recall of these lots. No other countries or lots are impacted. We have recorded a reserve associated with this issue in the second quarter of $13 million. I will discuss the impact of this settlement on our reported guidance in a few minutes.","Let's now turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I will discuss primarily on an operational basis. Again, operational revenue growth for the second quarter was 6%. In terms of the first half of the year, we reported revenue growth of 2%, with operational growth of 5%. This reflects an impact on reported revenue of approximately $55 million due to foreign exchange. Based on current rates, we expect the impact from foreign exchange for the remaining 2 quarters will be minimal.","Turning to more revenue details in the second quarter. Companion animal sales were 38% of sales in the quarter and grew $7 million or 2% operationally. Livestock sales were 61% of sales in the quarter and grew $57 million or 9% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 4%, 2 points lower than operational sales growth. Adjusted cost of sales was 35% of revenue, versus 35.9% in the year ago quarter, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange and the benefit of price increases, which were partially offset by unfavorable mix.","For the first half of the year, our adjusted cost of sales grew operationally by 1% and was 34.6% of revenue. As we said last quarter, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue in the remaining quarters and bring us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5%, which we are reaffirming today. This dynamic reflects the recognition of additional costs from building a global manufacturing and supply organization, which will be most evident in the second half of the year, as well as our expectation that foreign exchange will not have as favorable an impact on gross margin as it did in the first half of the year.","Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A increased by 9% operationally in the second quarter. As we have said, in the first 2 quarters of 2013, we were still building out many of the corporate functions needed to support Zoetis as an independent public company. We largely completed this process in the third quarter of last year and this unfavorable comparison is a driver of SG&A growth in the second quarter of 2014.","We also saw elevated growth in operating expenses in the U.S., EuAfME, and CLAR segments in the quarter as well. As part of our normal course of business, we continue to adjust investments and promotional activities to respond to market opportunities.","Year-to-date, SG&A was 30.6% of revenue, consistent with our full year guidance, which is approximately 31% at the midpoints of both SG&A and revenue. In other items, adjusted R&D expense increased 1% operationally. Interest expense declined $3 million in the quarter and adjusted other income was $3 million in the quarter, similar to last year. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 28.4%. And again, our adjusted net income was $189 million, representing reported growth of 6%, and operational growth of 11%.","Now on to our segment results. I will discuss these on an operational basis, but it should be noted that segment earnings are pretax numbers and presented on an adjusted basis. I will also highlight some of the more significant foreign exchange impacts in the regional results.","Beginning with the U.S., second quarter revenue was $459 million, an increase of 5%. Sales of livestock products grew 10%, with contributions across cattle, poultry and swine. Cattle products showed a significant increase based on improved market conditions from the year ago quarter. Cattle prices have continued to rise, with feed cost remaining low. While we have seen the number of placements declining, customers are placing younger, lighter animals into feed lots. And these cattle are more vulnerable to illness and disease and require treatment. This dynamic, along with continued growth in market share, has contributed to growth in our U.S. cattle business despite lower overall placements in the quarter.","We saw poultry product growth driven by new vaccines, such as the Georgia 08 vaccine, as well as growth in medicated feed additives. And in swine products, we benefited from continued growth in new products, such as our PCV M. hyo combination vaccine, DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective and ENGAIN feed additive. This new product momentum was tempered by the effect of PEDv, which Juan Ram\u00f3n addressed.","Sales of companion animal products grew 1%. This was driven by sales of APOQUEL, which was partially offset by declines from an increased competition in vaccines and RIMADYL. Meanwhile, U.S. segment earnings increased by 2%, as growth in revenue was offset by higher expenses, primarily due to promotional investments. For the first half of the year in the U.S., we had revenue growth of 5% and earnings growth of 10%. This is more indicative of the leverage that we expect in the U.S. than the second quarter results.","Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, or EuAfME. In EuAfME, second quarter revenue was $284 million, an increase of 4% operationally. Reported revenue growth was 7%, reflected a positive impact of 3 percentage points in the quarter due to the strength of the euro and sterling. Sales of livestock products increased 5% operationally, as the region experienced more positive results in Germany, the U.K. and Spain than in the first quarter, but this was slightly offset by declines in France. The livestock growth was primarily driven by increased sales in cattle and poultry products, which were slightly offset by a decline in swine products for the quarter. While weather conditions across Europe were generally more favorable than the prior year, growth in livestock was limited in the U.K. and Scandinavia by severe flooding, which affected seasonal herd movements.","Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 2% operationally, primarily due to sales of APOQUEL in the U.K. and Germany, and growth in emerging markets. This companion animal growth was somewhat offset by declines in France and Southern Europe due to increased competition in parasiticides. EuAfME segment earnings increased 9% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase and higher gross margins, which were partially offset by higher operating expenses.","Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment, or CLAR. Second quarter revenue was $214 million, an increase of 11% operationally. Reported revenue growth was flat, reflecting a negative impact of 11 percentage points in the quarter, primarily due to depreciation of currencies in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 13% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 6% operationally. The CLAR segment results were largely driven by the region's 2 largest markets, Brazil and Canada, while price growth for livestock products in high inflation markets, such as Venezuela and Argentina, also made significant contributions to growth in the quarter.","In Brazil, growth was driven primarily by sales of cattle and poultry products, as well as companion animal products. Meanwhile, the company generated increased sales of cattle products in Canada, as higher prices for cattle led to increased treatments. Canada also saw an increase in sales of swine products, such as anti-infectives and vaccines, while it posted a slight decline in poultry products.","CLAR segment earnings increased 16% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growing at a faster rate than operating expenses.","In Asia Pacific, or APAC, second quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 5% operationally. Our APAC segment also felt a significant impact due to depreciation from currencies in Australia, Japan, India and other countries, which led to a negative 6 percentage point impact on revenue.","Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in New Zealand and Australia, growth of swine products in China and growth of poultry products in Australia and India. This growth was offset by declines in Japan and Korea. In Australia, we saw an increase in the movement of herds to feedlots, which benefited our business as treatments increased. However, climate conditions remain difficult, and we expect the higher feedlot activity to lead to reduce herd sizes in the coming quarters.","Sales of companion animal products increased 1% operationally, largely due to an increase in equine products in Australia, which was offset by declines in companion animal products in Japan. APAC segment operating earnings increased 11% operationally, due to revenue growth, a decline in operating expenses and slightly favorable gross margin.","Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. We have now reported 1\/2 of the fiscal year and remained confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our financial guidance for revenue, adjusted SG&A, and adjusted EPS for full year 2014, and making an adjustment to our reported EPS guidance. We have raised the lower end of our revenue guidance, and now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.675 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost-savings efforts, which is forecasted to be offset by the full year impact of cost incurred to build our global manufacturing and supply functions, as well as unfavorable mix. The incremental cost will be reflected primarily in the second half of 2014.","Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.44 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we have raised the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance and now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. This guidance reflects our ability to achieve our profitability targets as we absorb multiple headwinds in 2014, including: The incremental costs of standing up our global manufacturing and supply operations; unfavorable comparisons in corporate function expense; and an additional month of higher interest expense.","Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $175 million and $195 million, primarily related to stand-up and acquisition-related cost. This range has increased due to the commercial settlement charge related to Mexico that I mentioned earlier. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for reported diluted EPS for full year 2014 will now be between $1.16 and $1.20 per share, a change from the $1.15 to $1.21 range we had previously set. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.","Our long-term value proposition remains anchored in 3 objectives: to grow revenue in line with or faster than the market; to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue; and to find investment opportunities with strong returns to our business and return excess capital to our shareholders.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for your questions. John?","John O'Connor","Thank you, Glenn. Operator, first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","First, on your vaccine -- on your PED vaccine. Will you have a competitive advantage in getting this vaccine to the market? If you could just give us a better sense as to where the competitors are and what kind of commercial opportunity are we looking at? And a quick follow-up, if I may, I'm not sure if I understand it, Ram\u00f3n, correctly on APOQUEL. Did I hear you correctly in saying that you expect to have supply to the market, increased supply to the market, later this year? Or is it still a 2015 expectation?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Alex, it's Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix. So let me start confirming that for APOQUEL, we expect that to normalize supply next year in April. And at that time, I will be able to supply more product to new customers. On the first question, on the PEDv, so we have a program now that we expect to complete soon and to submit that to the FDA, a conditional -- license for conditional approval. And there is one vaccine already in the market covering this disease. And we expect that our vaccine also will cover the needs of swine producers to protect animals against this outbreak and its high significant impact on their herds.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. We'll next go to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question on the business is maybe on use of cash, if I may. In your last slide, where you kind of summed up the 3 big priorities, I suppose, for the next 5 years. The last one is to find profitable investment opportunities and return excess capital to shareholders. So I was wondering, we haven't seen a lot of M&A yet at Zoetis. So I'm wondering why that is? And if we should expect the pace to pick up? And then the follow-up on that is the dividend. I don't think we've seen much of a dividend raise since you guys have spun out of Pfizer. So I was wondering if just philosophically, you could talk to us and maybe help set expectations, what we should expect about the rate of dividend increases.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Mark, on the first question on M&A, so in 2013, that it was the first year of Zoetis as an independent company. We were focused on standing up our operations and then, we decided that maybe it was not the right time for us to consider on M&A activity. We are now that -- we have, in most of the cases, completed our infrastructure, with the exception of IT. We think that we can now consider M&A opportunity that the market brings to us. And we'll be active pursuing these opportunities. We know that because of our size and our market share, we may face some challenge in terms of antitrust. This will incorporate it in our analysis, but definitely, we will consider any opportunity that will match our strategic objective, and also will provide the return on the investment.","Glenn David","Mark, related to your question on dividends. So today, we have increased our dividend. And subject to board approval, we do expect to grow the dividend at a rate that is equal to or faster than our growth in adjusted net income.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Certainly. We'll take a question now from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Jessica M. Fye - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Jessica Fye on for Chris. A question on gross margin, just as we're starting to think about next year. Can you just remind us how much of your manufacturing Pfizer still does? And how we should think about the impact of that, I think there's some manufacturing royalty kicking in for the product they supply you with next year? And then maybe also just following up on Mark's question on M&A. We're seeing a number of tax inversion transactions across the space and just would like to hear your views on whether that will be of interest to Zoetis.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So in terms of M&A, also, this tax inversion opportunity, we will continue to exploring any opportunity that will provide reduction in terms of effective tax rate, something that definitely we will see the opportunities the market -- that exist in the market. And we will decide based on these opportunities. On the gross margin, I will ask Glenn to respond to your question.","Glenn David","So in terms of gross margin for 2015 and specifically to the impact of the Pfizer MSA. So when we looked at the potential impact of the Pfizer MSA, that it might have in 2015. Based on 2013 costs and volumes, we expected it to have about a $30 million negative impact on cost of goods going into 2015. We've taken a lot of actions to minimize that impact, and those actions have resulted in reducing that exposure by about 1\/2. However, since then, a number of those products, APOQUEL being one of them, have had growth in volume. So it will limit our ability to bring the $30 million down fully, but we have taken many actions to minimize the impact.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich from Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, we've seen some pretty strong livestock trends, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if you can keep up kind of the high single-digit, low double-digit growth in the U.S.? And then second, regarding your operating cost, and you have a direct sales model, especially in the U.S. Just wondering if there's any ability for you guys to leverage the operating cost by maybe laying on distributors and using some of the national distributors more to minimize or drive some more leverage in the model.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","On the performance on livestock, definitely on the second quarter, we reported very strong growth. We see that the demand for animal proteins remained very strong in the worldwide market. We also see that the profitability of livestock producers -- it's now very high. They have high price of the meat, low prices for input, which increases significantly the profitability. And this is also driving the willingness of livestock producers to increase the herd, to supply all the market demand. We don't see any change in the near future, so we expect that the livestock market will continue growing in the future. In terms of our direct sales model, so we are convinced that the demand generation model that we have, which means that our own field force and also our own group of veterinarians are interacting directly with customers. And this interaction is generating very strong demand and very strong support to our portfolio. In the U.S., we combined our direct efforts with partnership with distributors, for those customers that we don't have the reach because of economical conditions. And we see that this model is working very well, and we'll continue supporting our product portfolio through this direct interaction, and also with the combination and partnership with some of our distributors that will reach these smaller customers.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Certainly. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So first question I had was on SG&A leverage. What is your ideal level of SG&A leverage and when do you expect to get there after you finish this Pfizer separation? And then second question I had was, we've seen a number of development-stage, companion animal health companies starting up. I'm just curious, your thoughts on the unmet needs these companies address and if there's potential partnership opportunities here?","Glenn David","So this is Glenn. I'll address the SG&A question. In terms of the SG&A leverage, so the way we think about this is, in 2014 in particular, we have indicated that we do have incremental expenses related to building up our corporate functions, and that is increasing the level of growth we expect in SG&A this year. However, over the long term, we do expect to grow SG&A in line with inflation, while being able to grow our revenue at a pace faster than the market, which will continue to improve our margins going forward.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay, the other question was about these biopharma companies and potential partnerships. Well, I think it's -- we have already the infrastructure, also the reach to customers. And we have developed, over time, a very strong model in terms of direct sales to customers. And we are convinced that this model also can benefit smaller companies that will have maybe problems that will be covering and managing [ph] the market, but without the infrastructure to reach customers. So we will consider this kind of partnership with these companies.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I think you mentioned on the call that your parasiticide class within companion animal saw some pressure in the quarter. Can you just expand on that a little bit? Did it actually decline? And if so, maybe you could quantify it? And do you have anything in your pipeline that might cause this trend to be able to reverse in the coming year or so?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, our parasiticide franchise in companion animal didn't decline in the quarter, but the growth was affected by the entrance of new competitors. There have been 2 new competitors launching new parasiticides, oral parasiticides, and we have seen that the market dynamics in parasiticides are changing, and moving from the traditional parasiticides that there were topical to more attention to oral parasiticides. We also have programs in this area and we expect to launch these products, oral parasiticides for companion animals, in the future.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Erin Wilson in for Bob. Follow up to the SG&A expense question and the leverage of that metric going forward. What can be addressed or corrected near term or can be considered one-time in nature? And outside of some of those items, can you call out where you have made progress on this line as it relates to your separation from Pfizer? And I guess the second question then, similar would be -- can you just speak to the competition in U.S. companion animal in light of the increased promotional spending that you've called out. Why is it such a light trend in companion animal?","Glenn David","Sure. So in terms of the SG&A and items that might be considered one-time in nature, I think the key item is what we've been highlighting in terms of the buildup of our corporate enabling functions and the timing of which that ramped up and when those costs were most debited in the P&L. So in 2013, in the first half of the year, we were not running at our full cost base for our enabling functions and that corrected in the second half, and that's driving the difficulty in comparison year-over-year. Some of the areas that you have seen have significant improvement though year-over-year, I think when you look at the growth in our regions and our segments, you've seen very strong IBT growth or income growth in those regions, demonstrating continued focus on managing -- or on our expenses.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Maybe a comment on the competition in the U.S. and also details on the promotional activities that we conducted in the second quarter. Definitely, as I said during my remarks and also the remarks of Glenn, we have seen introduction of new parasiticides, also introduction of new vaccines and the introduction of generic competition to a product which is important in our portfolio, which is RIMADYL. And in terms of the additional investment in promotional activities in the quarter, I think it's only a question of pacing. If you take year-to-date, you would see that the investment in the year has been in line with our projections of growing promotional activities below the growth in terms of revenues.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher J. Benassi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Christopher Benassi on behalf of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Since the IPO, investors have believed in the story of continued improvement in Zoetis' margins. However, we are curious as to where you might see room for further margin improvement, possibly in SG&A, R&D or maybe even across the board.","Glenn David","In terms of where we see continued improvement. So R&D, I think, is one item that you've highlighted. We've seen growth in R&D that's been sort of in the low-single digits, while we still continue to be very effective with our R&D productivity. From an SG&A perspective, as well as a cost of goods perspective, we do continue to see areas for improvement. So as I mentioned, SG&A, we do expect to grow in line with inflation. And cost of goods, we're clearly focused on continuing to find areas to improve our cost of goods and expect incremental improvements in COGS going forward.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Taylor with CL King.","Ross Taylor - CL King & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions related to the PEDv vaccine you have in development. But for a conditional approval, what kind of efficacy data do you have to present to the regulators to receive a conditional approval? And I also wondered how much does a conditional approval limit appeal or uptake of this product once it does reach the market?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So in terms of the regulatory requirements for conditional approval for a vaccine, so we need to demonstrate safety of the vaccine and also efficacy in certain conditions. And the requirements for efficacy for a conditional license are lower than the efficacy requirements for a full license. In terms of the selling opportunities of a vaccine under conditional approval, I think it's something that, since the vaccine, in this case, will be responding to a real market need, we don't see that this will create any limitations. There will be some limitations in terms of promotional activities, but not limitations in terms of selling the product to the market.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","We now have a follow-up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Following up on the PEDv comments, I'm just wondering, Juan Ram\u00f3n, in your prepared remarks, you talked about how hog farmers are growing larger animals, even though we've seen, I guess, some pressure on the herd sizes. And I'm just wondering if your new product, ENGAIN, is helping to -- if you've seen some good uptake because of this? And if you could quantify that also? And then Glenn David, the tax rate was lower on a year-over-year basis. Just wondering what we could expect? And I also wanted to clarify, did you say your tax guidance does not include the R&D tax credits?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","The follow-up question on PEDv, so definitely, ENGAIN, it's helping producers to have a more efficiency in terms of food. So they are reaching feed efficiencies because of this product. This product is also a product that already exists in the market, it's ractopamine. And we think that the product that are released [ph] in the market, together with ENGAIN, is helping the producers to achieve the targeted weight, with lowered cost in terms of food.","Glenn David","And in terms of the tax rates. So the tax rate was lower in the quarter at 28.4%. We have reaffirmed our guidance of approximately 29% for the year, and we still believe the full year is the best view of our overall tax rate. And just to emphasize it, that does not include the R&D tax credit, which would lower our rate by approximately 50 basis points.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Next we have a follow-up from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Erin again. A quick follow-up. There has been some recent changes, or recently announced upcoming changes, in the companion animal diagnostics market in the U.S., with IDEXX Laboratories moving to a direct distribution model. Do you see this as an opportunity for you? What -- and just generally speaking, what is your underlying growth rate for your diagnostics business?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So we remain committed to diagnostics. We see diagnostics as very complementary to our current business, in both R&D and also commercial. And we are trying to build our portfolio in terms of diagnostics. And the change on IDEXX in terms of direct model, it's something that we will not comment on the strategy of our competitors, but definitely, we'll explore any opportunity that will further penetrate our diagnostic depth into the market.","John O'Connor","Operator, next question, please?","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to a follow-up from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Sorry if you addressed this earlier, had to hop off for a minute. But what can we expect for your November Investor Day? If you could just frame that for us. Can we look for something like a 5-year outlook? If you could just give us more color as to what we can see from you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So we're working on the details of the agenda that we will communicate to you in the near future. So one of the objectives that we have during this day is to provide much more details on our strategy. Also have the opportunity to provide this information in terms of commercial, in terms of manufacturing, in terms of R&D, from members of my leadership team, that will go into some detail that may have not been provided until now. And in terms of the outlook, we are considering what should be the details that we will provide in terms of the outlook, and we are still considering different timeframes that will be information that we'll be sharing with you at that time. The other objective is also to go into some additional details on the animal healthcare market, to have much more clarity in terms of projections of the market and also the opportunities for both livestock and companion animals.","John O'Connor","Operator, are there any other questions?","Operator","At this time, there are no additional phone questions.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well with that, thank you very much for joining us today.

Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Rick will provide an overview of results, and then we'll open the call for your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of the Zoetis website. We're also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. And a PDF version of the slides representing and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of the certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our 2012 10-K and our 2013 10-Qs.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, such as the recurring costs of becoming a stand-alone public company.

These financials include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs that were attributed to the animal health business of Pfizer. As such, the combined financial statements for these periods do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a stand-alone public company, which can make comparisons to the prior periods difficult in certain instances.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Dina, and hello, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through the continued progress Zoetis is making and share my perspective on some of the trends impacting our company, our industry and the customers that we serve.","Let me start saying that I am very pleased with our third quarter results, 9% operational revenue growth and diluted adjusted EPS of $0.34. Once again, our diverse portfolio of products across geographies, species and therapeutic areas was a key factor in delivering results during this quarter. This performance also illustrates the value of the contribution that Zoetis colleagues around the world bring, and the strong and meaningful partnership we have developed with our customers.","I will outline the highlights of our business segment performance, and then Rick Passov will provide some additional comments on our financial results.","At the segment level, Zoetis continues to see the benefits of our business model, and we saw growth across all regions. Some of this growth reflects more normalized weather patterns for our customers in North America, continued market acceptance of our products, new launches such as vaccines for swine and poultry in certain countries, the continued focus of pet owners on the health of their animals and our focus on emerging markets. These more than offset the challenges in some of our markets related to competitive market dynamics, changing regulatory environments and economic conditions.","Now for a few highlights of this performance. In Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth in markets like India, China, Thailand and New Zealand. These were somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of drought conditions and livestock problems Australia. On a year-to-date basis, the APAC region grew 5% operationally versus total company growth of 6%. However, we expect the region to deliver growth for the year largely in line with the total company growth rate, as conditions in these diverse markets are expected to improve.","In Canada, Latin America, we saw growth in our 2 largest markets in the region, Brazil and Canada, as well as Venezuela. In Brazil, we saw strong growth in poultry while cattle sales were relatively flat.","In Europe\/Africa\/Middle East, we delivered strong growth from livestock products in emerging markets such as Russia, Turkey and South Africa, and growth in companion animals business, mainly in Western Europe.","And finally, in the U.S., we saw growth across all segments of our business. In particular, cattle products experienced significant growth compared to the same quarter last year, which was hurt by the severe drought conditions. Although cattle placement declined in the third quarter compared to 1 year ago, September trends were positive, and the market anticipated favorable trends to continue into October. The expectations of increased cattle movement have resulted in higher demand for animal health products in the third quarter.","From a global perspective, livestock sales grew by 8% operationally and companion animal sales grew by 11% operationally. Again, through these results, we see the strength of our portfolio, scale, global presence and business model. Weather conditions continue to improve for many of our livestock producers. This is, of course, positive news for those who have been managing their businesses in often very difficult circumstances during the last 12 months. But challenges remain for our customers in Australia, where the drought is having a significant impact.","In the third quarter, we also saw continued disease outbreaks in both the livestock and the companion animal sectors. These outbreaks can have a serious impact on the health of animals, and in the case of livestock producers, in their profitability.","You may recall on our last earnings call that I talked about the outbreak of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv. The virus typically affects pigs in the nursery and it has sadly continued to spread. The disease has been reported in at least 17 U.S. states. There is no vaccine at this time, and producers and veterinarians remain on high alert. Of note, researchers of the U.S. Department of Agriculture say that PEDv does not pose a threat to human health or to food safety. We are closely monitoring the situation and its impact on our customers. We do not currently expect this outbreak to materially impact our 2013 financial results.","Zoetis continues to support the University of Minnesota with the development of a rapid diagnostic test for the disease, and collaborating with the university is just one way in which Zoetis is investing in finding a solution to combat the virus.","Also, in the Asia Pacific region, we have partnered with authorities in Taiwan to respond to their first confirmed cases of rabies in more than 50 years in the country. We work with the Taiwanese government to import 700,000 doses of rabies vaccine, Defensor 3, and this enabled the government to implement its emergency vaccination program and mitigate the spread of the disease to animals and humans in the country.","This quarter's performance has been achieved while we continue our efforts to stand up our company and to build out our infrastructure. This includes, as examples, opening Zoetis offices in a number of European locations and establishing our own financial shared services teams. This and other projects are all focused on enabling Zoetis to operate independently.","We continue to partner with regulatory agencies around the world to bring new, innovative animal health products to the market, as well as new formulations and indications, combination of products and geographical extension of our existing portfolio.","During this quarter, and of particular note, we saw that APOQUEL has now received approval from the European Commission. Total market approval for this product include the United States, New Zealand and 27 countries in Europe.","APOQUEL is indicated for the treatment of certain types of pruritus in dogs at least 12 months of age. In the U.S. and EU, roughly 8.2 million and 5.2 million dogs, respectively, are treated for itchiness. There are a number of factors that can trigger an itchy reaction such as infections, dermatitis and parasites. The length of treatment using current products varies from days or weeks for acute cases of each, to months for chronic allergic dogs. Options to address itchiness in dogs, including the type and length of any product prescribed or suggested, will vary based on diagnostics and the treatment philosophy of the veterinarians and the preference of the pet owners.","We also recently received approval in the U.S. of 2 generic formulations of ractopamine, a beta-agonist. The 2 products will be marketed as ENGAIN, which has been approved for swine, and ACTOGAIN, which has been approved for cattle. We currently expect these products to launch sometime in 2014. As you may know, ractopamine is a feed additive that helps cattle and pigs direct their food energy towards producing high-quality lean meat rather than fat. The product has been safely used for more than a decade and widely adopted in the U.S., Canada, Australia and Brazil.","We are excited to bring these products to Zoetis, and most importantly, to our customers.","In addition, through our approach to managing our existing brands, we are actively pursuing claims extensions for launching existing products into new geographies. We receive multiple approvals around the world each quarter. This enables to enhance our brand portfolio of products, and a few examples from this third quarter include BOVI-SHIELD GOLD ONE SHOT, which has been approved in Canada for use in cattle. Canada decisions builds on the recent approval for this combination of product received from the U.S. in the second quarter.","FACTREL has been approved for use in the U.S. with LUTALYSE for fixed-time artificial insemination of dairy cattle. Its approval allows producers to improve the reproductive performance of their herds.","Also in the U.S., we saw approval of EXCENEL RTU EZ for cattle and swine. These are the formulation of one of our existing products, EXCENEL RTU, with an improved delivery method making the product even easier to use. We will launch this enhanced product to U.S. cattle and pork markets in the fourth quarter.","All these activities enable us to deliver our innovation and capabilities to both existing and new markets, and leverage our global presence and scale to benefit customers around the world.","I would now like to mention another topic we have discussed in the past. We are expecting the U.S. FDA to issue final guidance 2013, which will establish the procedures for eliminating growth promotion indication for medically important antibiotics. Zoetis supports the U.S. FDA's efforts, and we are committed to working with our veterinary and livestock producer customers through this process. As we said previously, we don't expect this to have a material impact on our future financial results.","With 3 quarters now reported in our first year, I am very pleased with how we are meeting our commitments to customers, delivering financial results and setting a solid foundation for our future. External benchmark data shows that during the first half of the year, Zoetis revenue grew faster than the market. Data for our current quarter is not yet available. I continue to see great potential in our business and our industry over the coming years, and look forward to continuing our discussions.","And with that, let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis. And I will now hand the call over to Rick and ask him to walk us through the third quarter financial results and guidance for 2013. Rick?","Richard A. Passov","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. I'll now provide some additional details on our financial results for the third quarter.","Revenue was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of approximately 8% year-over-year, including a negative impact of 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. Excluding this FX impact, revenue grew 9%, and I will discuss the key drivers in a minute.","Turning to net income. Reported net income of $131 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.26 decreased by 19%, primarily driven by certain stand-up costs associated with our full separation from Pfizer. On an adjusted basis, net income of $172 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.34 showed an increase of approximately 12% and 10%, respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $8 million of purchase accounting adjustments and $33 million of certain significant items, including stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer.","Turning now to our adjusted net income statement. Revenue was up 9% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As Juan Ram\u00f3n indicated, our operational increase was supported by higher sales across all species. Companion animal growth was driven primarily by higher sales in large developed markets, while livestock growth benefited from more normalized weather patterns in North America and good growth in many emerging markets around the world. However, we continue to see a negative impact on cattle revenues in Australia from ongoing drought conditions, while cattle revenues in Brazil are being impacted by increased local competition.","Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 34.7% of revenues versus 35 -- excuse me, 34.5% in the year ago quarter. This reflects the impact of product mix and faster growth in emerging markets, partly offset by the benefit of relatively higher growth in the U.S.","Adjusted SG&A increased 9% operationally, in line with our revenue growth, while adjusted R&D expense decreased 1% operationally. Adjusted net interest expense was $29 million in the third quarter of 2013, reflecting our debt issuance in January of this year.","Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter decreased to income of $7 million in the third quarter of 2013 from income of $10 million in the third quarter of 2012.","Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 29.5%. And again, our adjusted net income increased approximately 12% to $172 million for the third quarter or 16% operational growth.","Now on to our segment results, which I will discuss on an operational basis. Segment earnings are pretax numbers and are reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S. third quarter revenue was $495 million, an increase of 10%.","Sales of livestock products grew 11%, driven by cattle, poultry and swine. Results reflected increased volumes and the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter. We saw strong growth in sales of cattle products, the largest contributor to livestock growth, which benefited from an unusually weak year-ago quarter, when the impact of the drought was most evident.","Sales of poultry products were driven -- were strong as well, primarily due to medical feed additives.","Swine products increased, driven primarily by continued customer acceptance of new products.","Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 10%. This increase was driven by sales of small animal products, reflecting the benefit of price increases taken in the first quarter, as well as the positive impact of promotional efforts.","And equine sales were relatively flat.","U.S. segment earnings increased 23% due to strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and timing of certain promotional spend.","Now turning to our Europe\/Africa\/Middle East region. In EuAfME, third quarter revenue was $270 million, an increase of 9% operationally.","Sales of livestock products grew 7% operationally. This reflects an increase in cattle product sales across many emerging markets, tempered by a continued decline in sales of cattle products in Western Europe due to challenging market dynamics and the competitive environment.","Sales of swine products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of a new vaccine across many markets.","Sales of companion animal products grew 15% operationally and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal product sales grew approximately 5% operationally. This growth was driven by sales of anti-infective and parasiticide products for small animals.","EuAfME segments earnings increased 1% operationally. The benefit of increased revenue was largely offset by the unfavorable impact of product and geographic mix. In addition, results in the year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult.","Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was approximately $171 million, an increase of 9% operationally.","Sales of livestock products grew 6% operationally, driven by sales of cattle and poultry products. Cattle product sales increased primarily due to growth in Venezuela, Canada and Mexico, while sales in Brazil were relatively flat, reflecting the impact of increased local competition.","Sales of poultry products were driven by medical feed additives, primarily in Brazil.","Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally, largely due to growth in Canada based on the timing of the parasiticide season, our ability to maintain market share gained from a competitor supply issue in the year ago quarter and the timing of price increases. In addition, we continue to benefit from increased demand in Brazil.","CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally. This increase was primarily driven by revenue growth and favorable product mix. In addition, results in the year ago quarter were unfavorably impacted by certain adjustments, which can make comparisons to prior periods difficult.","In APAC, third quarter sales were $167 million, an increase of 7% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 8% operationally, driven primarily by growth in emerging markets across swine, poultry and cattle. Increased swine product sales came from continued customer acceptance of new products in China.","Poultry product sales benefited from ongoing customer acceptance of products in emerging markets and the resolution of a license registration issue in India.","Cattle product sales growth was primarily driven by performance in New Zealand, partially offset by the impact of prolonged drought conditions in Australia.","Sales of companion animal products grew 3% operationally, driven by increases in developed markets, such as Japan and Taiwan, and in emerging markets such as China. This growth was partially offset by declines in Australia due to increased competition.","APAC segment operating earnings increased 3% operationally. This reflects unfavorable product and geographic mix and increased investment in promotional activities.","Now let us turn to guidance for full year 2013. We have reported 3 quarters in the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year financial guidance. As a result, we are narrowing our adjusted financial guidance for the full year 2013 to reflect our performance year-to-date.","We now expect adjusted EPS of between $1.38 and $1.42 per share. In addition, we remain on track to the guidance we gave for non-recurring costs related to stand-up activities and the remaining integration costs associated with prior acquisitions. Year-to-date, we have booked $147 million for these non-recurring costs. These costs, along with purchase accounting adjustments, are excluded from our adjusted numbers.","Subsequent to the third quarter, we have taken the following decisions that will result in onetime charges of up to approximately $20 million and which will be reflected in fourth quarter reported results. We recently integrated research and development for our branded generics business into our global R&D operations. We are exiting assets associated with manufacturing intermediate ingredients for certain products that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties. And finally, we have decided to divest certain assets in our aquaculture business. Including all of these items, which will be excluded from our adjusted numbers, we now expect the range of total non-recurring costs to be between $200 million and $240 million for fiscal 2013.","So including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full year is now expected to be between $0.98 and $1.02 per share.","Finally, we continue to evaluate opportunities to improve our operations and assess the carrying value of certain assets based on changes in events and circumstances. At this point, I don't expect any ongoing reviews to materially impact the range for non-recurring costs that we are providing with this update.","Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we'll open the line for questions. Dina?","Dina Fede","Thank you, Rick. Operator, we're ready for our first question, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a couple parted question here. So we saw a strong recovery in the U.S. kind of livestock and cattle market this quarter. How do you see the market growth playing out from here as we look out the next year or 2, as grain prices have normalized? I guess, what are you hearing from your customers on herd recovery? I'm just trying to understand how that dynamic plays out as we annualize these drought comps. And the second question was on expenses. We saw a step-up in SG&A this quarter. Is this a sign of higher spend going forward? Or are we just seeing some promotional spend as this livestock market recovers?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Chris. Let me answer the questions and maybe Rick also will add some comments. On the U.S. livestock, a significant portion of the U.S. is related to cattle. We saw this quarter that cattle performed extremely well. But again, compared to last year, where the drought conditions were affecting the business significantly, we expect the last part of the year normalized in terms of movement of animals to the feedlot. It is true that we have fewer animals than last year. We expect also that the cattle business will take 2 to 3 years to rebuild the herd. And this is what we had been already communicating, that in cattle it takes longer to rebuild the herd, while in swine and poultry we have seen that this recovery has been much faster. And this is also reflected in our revenues, because in the first 9 months, poultry and swine in the U.S. have performed very well. In terms of expenses as SG&A, so we had in the last quarter the delay on the parasiticide season. And also related to that, we decided also to postpone some of the promotional activities until the time of the parasiticide season. This occurred in the third quarter, and the third quarter has been impacted in terms of promotional expenses that were mostly delayed from the second quarter. In terms of expenses, we are reconfirming our guidance. And you can see that we have also lowered the upper range of our guidance on expenses, SG&A as well as R&D. Rick, you want to add any other comment?","Richard A. Passov","The only thing I would add is that if I look at total operating expense in Q3 versus Q3 of last year, we're slightly better. If I look at total operating expense year-to-date through this year versus last year, we're more than slightly better. Also year-to-date, we're under where we expect to be for the full year and that gives us the ability to continue to support promotional spend into the fourth quarter. And the last thing that I would say is that, in addition to the timing of promotional spend in the third quarter that Juan Ram\u00f3n described, there is also the increase in enabling functions spend, which is higher, Q3 versus Q2, than it has been in the prior quarters. So when I look at total SG&A, this quarter being basically where it was last quarter and better year-to-date, including the enabling functions spend, we're definitely on track to where we expect to be.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Operationally, in terms of revenues, we are growing year-to-date by 6%, while expenses are growing year-to-date only by 2%.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess, first off, on the new products that you talked about, Juan Ram\u00f3n, APOQUEL, EXCENEL and the beta-agonist, just wondering if you could give us some color on how you expect these products to ramp into 2014? And then also, we saw a small acquisition this quarter -- or after the quarter closed in October, Advanced Food Technologies. Wondering if you could give us some more color on the size of that deal, and what else you guys are looking at on the M&A front?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","On APOQUEL. So definitely, APOQUEL, it's a product that is expected by the market. It's covering unmet need to treat dogs suffering from itchiness. The current treatments are corticosteroids and also some other products that are available to the veterinarians. Also, in some cases, the veterinarians are also using many different alternatives, different pharmaceuticals to treat these dogs. We expect that in 2014, when the product will be launched, the adoption will be gradual, switching current treatment to APOQUEL. We are convinced that, in the long term, APOQUEL will be an important product in our portfolio. In terms of beta-agonist, so we are also entering into this market with 2 generic formulations: one for swine, the other one for cattle. The swine product will be launched in the first quarter. The cattle product will be launched in the second half of 2014. Again, so it's something that we think that will be an opportunity for Zoetis to incorporate 2 products which are used by livestock producers in the U.S, and also will fill a gap that we have in our portfolio, that we'll be able really to offer to our customers a larger range of products and solutions to treat and to prevent diseases. In terms of the acquisition of -- that we also announced in this quarter, it's a small company. Definitely, it is small, but it's following the strategy that we already started some years ago to really complement our portfolio, our core business, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, with complementary spaces. And we entered in devices, in poultry devices, with the acquisition of Embrex some years ago. We also have now in diagnostics with the acquisition of Synbiotics. We're also offering services to our customers, and these food safety products also will complement our portfolio. And we will enter in a space that it's growing importance because its consumers and also governments are demanding higher food safety, and we think that we can bring our commercial strength and also our expertise in R&D to really leverage this acquisition. That, again, is a small one and we have some revenues in 2014, but not significant earnings.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question was if you had any thoughts on some of your competitors who have been talking about spinning out or selling their animal health businesses. And I was just wondering how that may affect you, or what do you think about that?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, I must say that -- thank you for the question, Louise. We are focused on making sure that we are meeting our objectives in 2013 and at the same time that we are standing up Zoetis. As you can imagine, this has significant complexity that we need to manage, but I think we are showing that we are able to manage the complexity and delivering strong results. I think it's something that -- speculating on other companies, I think, is probably something that we should not really enter, but continued focus on delivering the value to our customers and our shareholders.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- maybe just building on the last question. If Novartis or Merck were to decide to part with their animal health company, would that something you guys would consider bidding on? Or should we, as investors and analysts, really think about that as outside the scope of your capabilities right now, given some balance sheet constraints, as well as maybe some F -- perhaps FTC issues? And then given the SG&A in the quarter, over the long term, Rick, is it reasonable that investors should still expect the SG&A, as a percent of revenues, to decline over the long term?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, I would -- thank you, Mark, for the question. And maybe I will repeat that it's -- this is something that other companies are really considering a strategic option for their animal health business. We are convinced that we have the critical mass and also the diversity in terms of our geographies, species and therapeutic areas to be successful. Definitely considering M&A will be part of our model. But at this point it's something that we need to really to ensure that we are meeting our commitments in 2013 and '14. And in terms of M&A, I would say that, at this point, we are focused on areas that will be smaller, will be complementary, filling gaps in our portfolio or adding some complementary spaces, like the acquisition that we just announced. In terms of SG&A, maybe, Rick, you want to answer this question?","Richard A. Passov","Sure. So Mark, as you can see, in 2013, there's very good operating leverage in the business. In 2014, as we've spoken about in the past, we're going to continue to build out our own infrastructure, look across all of our processes and gain operating efficiencies, and we think that continues to drive operating leverage. And beyond that, I'm not going to make a long-term prediction. But I do think that the leverage that we see in '13 can be sustained, especially as we get into 2014, to some degree.","Operator","And we'll go next to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The question's around the initiation of your eCommerce business earlier in the spring. You made reference to a number of customers that had signed up and a number of customers that had used it, and I wondered if we could get an update? And then on the same thought, Rick, is there some reason that, that, certainly in the U.S., I recognize, can -- or is it already demonstrating some improvement in overall operating margin?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","In terms of the eCommerce, it's true that I provided some details on the last call. I don't have in front of me what is the number of customers that are already signed off on this eCommerce. What I had is the feedback of the U.S. team has been positive, and the feedback from our customers is also very positive. So I think it's something that we are adding to the way that we are interacting with customers, and we see as additional way of really providing support and services to our customers. In terms of the improvement in operating margin, you mean for the U.S. or in general. I think it's -- definitely, we are committed and is something that we mentioned many times that we are committed to grow our revenues in line or faster than the market. And we are also committed to improve margin faster than revenues. And we'll achieve that over time by the right actions in terms of gross margin, the cost of the products sold, the right strategy in terms of pricing and control on our operating expenses. And we are convinced that this is something that we'll be able to deliver in the future.","Operator","And we'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And this is Erin filling in for Willoughby this morning. First question on SG&A expense again. So should we think about some of your cost structure initiatives as essentially being pushed out into 2014? Can you discuss those dynamics, just flesh it out a little bit? And then my second question is in U.S. companion animal. It was also very strong. Are these trends sustainable going forward? And how should we think about the underlying utilization trends for the companion animal segment, in the U.S. in particular?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","We'll have the opportunity to discuss about our 2014 guidance next year. We don't see, at this point, any reason why what we have been describing in the past will change, and we are confident that we will continue with discipline in terms of SG&A and having the right level of investment to support our revenue growth aspirations. The U.S. companion animal business, as you said, it's doing very well in the U.S., and we are growing in all the different categories. Definitely, with the launch of APOQUEL, we expect also to generate growth in the future in 2014. And we think that the level of our business model, which is, as we said many times, direct interaction with customers; deliver innovation; at the same time that we deliver innovation, also making sure that we protect our existing portfolio with new formulations or combination of products, new combination of vaccines; and also the quality of our manufacturing are very strong elements really to sustain our growth in the companion animal business in the U.S., as well as in other markets.","Richard A. Passov","Erin, I'll just add a little bit to the comment that you made on SG&A. There's nothing kind of off-track or that's changing in terms of how we see spend evolving this year. In the guidance that we're giving you now, we are actually narrowing our full year guidance for SG&A, as well as R&D. So with respect to our expectations as we gave them to you in April, we're performing at or better than how we expected there. Quarter-to-quarter, there are variations in spend, partly, as we had said earlier, in Q1 and Q2, the pace of spend on the enabling functions was somewhat slower than we expected, and then also, as Juan Ram\u00f3n pointed out, higher promotional spend in the second half. But the guidance that we're giving you now, if I can point out again, is narrowed versus April. That includes our expectations of spend for the full year. And as I pencil through that guidance, I get to the performance, the operating leverage that we expected and therefore, the kind of expense control that we believe exists in the model.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Rick, I don't mean to beat a dead horse. I think the surprise this quarter was the nice top line beat, which didn't translate into an earnings meet. And if I look out at models, we are assuming improvements in operating margins. And I'm just, again, trying to understand if there's still significant juice enough just by achieving synergies or efficiencies as a stand-alone company, or eventually will we have to see further consolidation with, specifically, your business model in order to see improvements in operating margins going forward, sort of beyond 2014, if you could kind of speak broadly?","Richard A. Passov","Well, again, I mean, I think I would just, again, reaffirm the guidance that we're giving you. The way I look at this is at the beginning of this year, we set out to achieve the operating leverage that we've discussed, and we're basically on track to do that. And the narrowing of our total year spend, I think, reinforces that. And again, quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be variations in spend to either support various promotional campaigns, or in this particular quarter, the growth in enabling functions year-over-year. And when I include the total cost of supporting our own infrastructure and compare the Q3 of '13 to the Q3 of 2012, and basically were on top of each other, I think, in my view, that's actually a good sign coupled with reaffirming the full year guidance. So I don't -- I wouldn't read anything into this particular quarter in terms of changing what we believe the operating model is for this business, this year or going forward.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And Jami, let me add to what I mentioned on the previous question, that our financial model for the next 5 years is to grow in line or faster than the market. The market is expecting to grow compound annual growth of 6%. We expect our margins growing faster than revenues and there will be, with the right control of expenses, that we expect to grow in line with inflation and also control on our cost of goods and also the pricing strategy. This will result in really improving long term, in this 5 years of period, improvement in terms of our margins. We don't need, at this point, any further consolidation. We have already the critical mass that we need. And that's really, with the critical mass and with the investment that we made already in most of the markets that we operate, we are confident that this will generate synergies in the future.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So with respect to the M&A outlook, it seems, Juan Ram\u00f3n, that you downplayed the opportunity to do larger acquisitions. But as you think about the business and creating shareholder value and the opportunity to boost the value of Zoetis' stock, could you just talk about whether you would consider stepping up the company's market share through a larger transaction to take the market share globally from, let's say, 20% currently to maybe 25% or 30%? I would think that, that would boost the value of your share significantly, even if you were to issue equity to do such a deal. So I guess, maybe my 2 questions are: Why shouldn't that be an opportunity? And second, how do you see M&A building shareholder value if you won't consider medium- to large-sized deals?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Dave. And I think, as you can imagine, so nothing should be excluded, at least from the internal analysis of exploring opportunities. What are the conditions that we need really to meet for any acquisition, small, medium or a large? A strategic fit and the financials really are supporting the investment. The experience that we had when we acquired Fort Dodge, at the time, we were a company of $2 billion, Fort Dodge was a company of $1 million -- $1 billion. We divested 10% of the combined companies, a little bit more than 10% because of antitrust issues. Now with a market share of 20%, you can imagine that the challenge in terms of antitrust will be even higher. And this is something that we need also to include in any analysis, because we know that paying a premium price for integration[ph] and divesting at a lower price because of FTC regulations or European Union regulations will be probably not the right decision for our shareholders. We'll continue analyzing, exploring and definitely, if it makes sense, so then we'll make that call.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. First, I assume this really didn't happen, but did you see any benefit with Zilmax coming off the market? I know, obviously, you didn't have a beta-agonist. Just wondering if there was any other product that could have seen a bump in growth? And then second, do you have plans to ramp production of any specific product category? It looks like medicinal feed additives or maybe implants, I believe, has been a weaker category over the last few years. Wondering now if you have the ability to increase production as a stand-alone company?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Let me probably start with answering the first question with a general comment. I don't think it's positive for the animal health industry that any product is facing regulatory issues or customer issues. And this is something that definitely all companies are exposed to this kind of risk. And I think it's something that, in some cases, this can benefit some of the competitors operating in this space. We decided to launch a generic of ractopamine independently of any kind of issue related to Zilmax. And we are convinced that the product that we are launching had really something that will help producers to enhance productivity, and also to achieve the quantity of meat and affordability of meat that is required by consumers. In terms of plans to ramp any specific category, I think one of the advantage that we have in our portfolio is the diversity in terms of many multiple dimensions, including therapeutic areas. We are convinced that there are areas that are generating some opportunities short term, while others will generate opportunities in more longer and medium term. We want really to make sure that our strategy is really covering these opportunities in all short and long term and definitely we have products in medicinal feed additive. We also have products in implant. And we continue really ensuring that we offer to our customers a complete range of products and solutions to treat or prevent diseases in their animals.","Dina Fede","Thank you.

Based on the latest external estimate, we have continued to gain market share through the last 12 months ending in March 2018. Second, we are very excited about the Abaxis acquisition that closed this week, well ahead of our expectations. And this should allow us to move quickly into the integration phase. And finally, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance.","When you look at our historical performance and the recent revenue growth, much of our success comes from our diverse portfolio, a portfolio that has been compiled through the long-term investments in R&D and the careful selection of external partnerships and acquisitions. We are very confident in the long-term return of this investment. And in 2018, we have had an increase in R&D expense as we continue to accelerate certain projects in key growth areas such as monoclonal antibodies that will address pain associated with osteoarthritis and other indications.","We're also progressing with the development of combination products based on the sarolaner compound, which is used in new products like Simparica, an oral parasiticide for dogs, and Stronghold Plus, a topical combination parasiticide for cats.","We have filed for approval a new three-way combination parasiticide, which if approved will be known by trade name Simparica Trio. It will combine sarolaner with two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasiticides such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease.","We remain very confident in the technical package that we have completed for this product. We are taking a phased filing approach in various markets around the world and subject to regulatory reviews and approvals, we would anticipate it coming to the market in 2020. We are also proud of recent launches of new swine vaccines, which includes Fostera Gold in the U.S. as well as PRRS, PCV2, PCV and M Hyo combination vaccine that are performing well in other markets. All demonstrate our continued expertise in vaccines and have us well-positioned for continued growth.","External partnerships and acquisitions are also important for innovation and providing us new capabilities to predict, prevent, detect, and treat disease in animals. We have always seen diagnostics as an important high growth space for Zoetis, an important piece of comprehensive solutions we can bring to veterinarians.","We wanted to find the right opportunity and partner. And this week, we completed our acquisition of Abaxis, a leading provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments for approximately $2 billion.","With our growing scale and direct customer relationships in approximately 45 countries, we can help accelerate the growth of Abaxis portfolio in the U.S. and International markets. We can also combine the expertise in diagnostics with our diverse portfolio and provide customers with integrated solutions that can work across the continuum of care.","We are now moving ahead with the integration plans. While there will be cost efficiencies, the real value of this transaction is in the revenue growth opportunities, especially, International.","Another area of external investment has been in monoclonal antibodies. In addition, to our internal expertise, this June we announced a five-year agreement with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to collaborate on additional research in antibody therapies. As part of this agreement, Zoetis will be using Regeneron technology to develop monoclonal antibodies for use in companion animals and livestock animals. Regeneron will also work with Zoetis to evaluate select Regeneron antibodies in diseases of dogs and cats. Together we'll generate data that could be used in later human trials and for proof of concept in veterinary species. This collaboration demonstrates our access to multiple sources of innovation and reinforces our reputation as the animal health partner of choice in R&D.","Finally, we are also expanding into sensors, digital platform and data analytics tools that help our customers predict and detect diseases in their animals. We recently acquired a small company based in Austria called Smartbow. They are an innovative partner. We have been working with them for more than a year on precision dairy farming technology.","Smartbow has developed a cow monitoring system that helps dairy farmers use active electronic ear tags to collect data and analytics from individual animals. This includes monitoring for reproductive data, animal locations, detecting signs of stress, behavior change and disease and paving the way for early intervention and treatment.","Moving on the second quarter results. We achieved 9% operational growth in revenue, driven by the performance of new parasiticides and new vaccines, our dermatology portfolio as well as contributions from the rest of our in-line portfolio. Our key dermatology products, Apoquel and Cytopoint, generated $143 million in sales in the second quarter. This included our first ever quarter of $100 million in the U.S. where we continued to use direct-to-consumer advertising to bring both, disease and brand awareness.","We have continued to grow patient share in both the U.S. and International segments. And over the last 12 months we have generated more than $500 million in sales for our key dermatology portfolio. Our new parasiticide products, Simparica and Stronghold Plus, saw solid growth in the second quarter, with more than $50 million in sales for Simparica, putting it well on its way to blockbuster status this year. We continue to use our digital marketing and direct-to-consumer campaigns to support these products, and we are seeing good results in the U.S. and in other markets like Brazil.","As we said last quarter, we expect to grow our cattle, poultry, swine, and fish products in line or faster than the overall market, and we expect to see positive growth in the livestock market in 2018.","We have also sustained profitable performance in the second quarter. We grew our adjusted net income by 37% operationally, based on revenue growth, improvements to our gross margin, and continued benefits from U.S. tax reform.","In closing, I'm confident that we are taking the right actions and making the right investments to deliver on our objectives for 2018 and ensure our future growth.","With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our second quarter results, the Abaxis acquisition, and full-year 2018 guidance.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning everyone.","We've had an exciting and busy second quarter, but first I would like to lay out what I will cover today. I will discuss the Zoetis Q2 results, which do not include Abaxis performance. I will mention the most recent Abaxis quarterly revenue results separately just for your reference and context going forward. And I will then review changes to our 2018 guidance, which do reflect the acquisition of Abaxis this week as well as changes to foreign exchange rates.","Beginning with Q2 performance, we had another strong quarter with 9% operational revenue growth, balanced across our U.S. and International business segments, and we continued to grow adjusted net income at a rate significantly faster than revenue. Our performance was positive across all key markets and all core species.","Total company reported revenue growth was 12% in the second quarter, including a favorable 3% impact from foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by strong companion animal performance across both our International and U.S. segments.","Our in-line portfolio, including key dermatology products, continued to demonstrate solid growth, with new products also contributing strong growth across both companion animal and livestock.","Operational revenue growth of 9% was driven by 1% price and 8% volume. Of the 8% volume, 5% was from our in-line products, of which 2% came from our dermatology products and 3% from the rest of the in-line portfolio. The remaining 3% growth came from new products.","Adjusted net income grew 37% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvements, and a lower effective tax rate. As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint, had their best quarter yet with sales of $143 million.","We are well on our way to achieving more than $500 million combined sales target we previously communicated for these products in 2018. We're also very pleased with the uptake of Cytopoint and expect it to achieve blockbuster status this year, which is greater than $100 million of sales.","We also recognized record sales from Simparica in the quarter, generating $51 million worldwide. We continue to be very pleased with both the U. S. and international performance of this product.","Now before moving into Zoetis segment results, I would like to recognize a strong first fiscal quarter for Abaxis, which as I mentioned, is not included in Zoetis Q2 results. As a reminder, fiscal Q1 for Abaxis represents the months April to June for both U.S. and International.","Abaxis Q1 revenue was $68 million and represents 17% growth over the same period in the prior year. These results were provided to us by the Abaxis team, are unaudited, and were recognized under Abaxis accounting policies while they were an independent public company.","Now let's discuss segment revenues for Q2. International revenue grew 10% operationally in the second quarter, with positive contributions across all key markets, with companion animal operational growth of 17% and livestock operational growth of 6%.","Companion animal product growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, and increased medicalization rates in key international markets such as China and Brazil. Livestock products benefited from growing demand for animal protein, new product introductions, and the success of our field force.","Highlighting some key markets for the quarter, in China we grew 23% operationally, largely due to strength in companion animals, which increasingly represents a larger portion of our business there. A growing companion animal population and medicalization of pets contributed to this growth, with Q2 benefiting from increased usage of our parasiticide Revolution and vaccines.","In Brazil, sales were flat operationally. However, this is primarily a result of a national truck driver strike that occurred at the end of the international quarter, impacting recognition of livestock revenue within the quarter. We expect to recover these sales in Q3, as shipping resumed early in the quarter. We anticipate stronger than normal results in Q3.","Excluding the impact of the strike, both livestock and companion animal products performed very well in Brazil in Q2. For cattle in Brazil, investments in our field force, including local commercial campaign efforts, have led to increased penetration and coverage in key regions within the market. We also continue to see favorable export conditions that will contribute to our growth. Companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic due to a strong return on the direct-to-consumer investments.","Australia grew 16% operationally, primarily driven by cattle, companion animal, and sheep. In cattle, our vaccine business grew due to strong beef prices and the rebuilding of the herd in the market. Companion animal benefited from growth in Apoquel due to the return on our direct-to-consumer investments as well as strength of our in-line portfolio. Sheep products benefited from continued strength in local market conditions.","The UK contributed 23% operational growth with companion animal and cattle driving the largest increases. New products in companion animal generated strong growth with wholesale purchasing patterns in the prior year also contributing to growth for both companion animal and cattle.","Mexico grew 22% operationally, delivering growth in excess of 20% for the third consecutive quarter. And the growth was generated across all species. New products, including the recent launch of Simparica and strong demand generation by the field force is driving the positive performance.","Other emerging markets, particularly India, Poland and Turkey, performed well. India and Turkey had increased livestock product sales due to field force penetration and key account management. While Poland benefited from growth across both companion animal and livestock.","Overall, a very strong quarter for our International segment with growth across all key markets. New products, favorable market conditions and a return on strategic investments in our portfolio and field force are all helping to consistently drive positive results.","Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 9% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 15%, while livestock grew 1%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by our dermatology portfolio and new products, primarily Simparica. These gains were partially offset by decreases in certain in-line products due to competitive pressure. U.S. key dermatology sales reached a new milestone of $100 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting strong growth over the same quarter in the prior year. Both products also increased sales over Q1, consistent with expectations and the warmer summer months. I mentioned Simparica also had a strong quarter with the U.S. being a large contributor to the growth this quarter with more than 200% growth.","As communicated in the first quarter, we had anticipated Simparica returning to growth this quarter due to the timing of customer purchases in Q1 and Q2 of last year. Year-to-date growth of 46% also demonstrates our ability to gain clinic penetration and market share and realize the benefits of our DTC investments, which we are maintaining in 2018. Partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business was the continued impact of anticipated competition for Clavamox and Revolution. With Clavamox also impacted by the timing of promotional activities in the prior year.","The U.S. livestock business continued its strong growth in poultry and swine in the second quarter, partially offset by a decline in cattle. In poultry, there's the latest portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Swine continued growing in the second quarter, primarily from extended usage of Fostera Gold PCV MH, which we launched in the first quarter of this year. We expect to see continued adoption among our customers through the second of this year as it is the first and only vaccine to include two genotypes of PCV2, both 2a and 2b.","In the beef cattle business, sales of cattle products declined due to increased competition of certain medicated feed additives. As anticipated, the dairy cattle business continued to experience pressure with lower dairy prices and limited producer profitability. This led to a decline in sales of our MFAs and intramammaries.","Now moving on to the rest of the P&L, I will cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.7% increased approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and reflects favorable pricing, mix, reduced inventory waste and a benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network. Operating expenses in total grew 7% operationally versus the same period last year. The growth in operating expenses this quarter is primarily impacted by R&D growth of 16% and reflects increased investments in areas such as monoclonal antibodies, for chronic pain, and other pipeline programs.","We also realized higher spend in SG&A primarily due to increased compensation related costs. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from a comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 37% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, cost improvements to manufacturing and a lower effective tax rate. As previously communicated, we were able to create strong operating leverage while investing in strategic areas of future growth for Zoetis.","Now moving to guidance for the full year 2018. We continue to perform in line with our expectations. However, we are making certain adjustments to reflect the unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates that have occurred since our last update as well as to include the partial year impact of the Abaxis acquisition based upon our preliminary estimates.","Starting with revenue, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted revenue versus prior guidance by approximately $125 million. With the addition of Abaxis as well as other operational drivers we are maintaining the high end of the range at $5.8 billion and increasing the lower end of the range to $5.7 billion. We still expect to achieve operational growth of 5% to 7% excluding any impact from Abaxis.","Including Abaxis partial year revenue, which consist of five months of domestics activity and four months of International, our operational revenue growth increases to a range of 7% to 9%. Implicit in our updated full year guidance are certain impacts in Q4 that I want to remind you as you think about the remainder of the year. Our business in Q4 2017 was very strong, so growth off its higher base will moderate. U. S. livestock is one area where we experienced an exceptionally strong Q4.","In addition, the fourth quarter of this year will also include four fewer International selling days compared to last year, resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Please note that from an EPS growth perspective, the second half of 2018 will be impacted by the timing of cost of sales, which were higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to the second half of 2017.","For SG&A and R&D, we're increasing both the low and high ends of the range primarily due to the impact of the Abaxis acquisition. Adjusted interest expense is increasing to approximately $200 million to reflect the financing of the Abaxis acquisition. Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 20% from our previous range of 21% to 22%, primarily due to the impact of favorable discrete, non-recurring items, resulting from the implementation of U.S. tax reform.","For adjusted diluted EPS even with the negative foreign exchange impact of $0.07 and the slightly diluted impact of the Abaxis acquisition this year, we're maintaining the high end of the range at $3.10 and increasing the low end of the range to $3. Please note that our range for reported diluted EPS includes preliminary estimates for certain significant items and purchase accounting for the Abaxis acquisition.","Finally, we repurchased nearly $400 million of our shares in the first half of the year and our guidance grew reported and adjusted earnings per share, reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q2.","Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. We've delivered consistent operational revenue growth in the first half of the year with balanced contributions across all key markets and all four species. We are well positioned to meet our guidance for the year and anticipate continued positive trends in our key products and markets.","Our diversity, geographical presence and ability to innovate, will continue to provide a platform for growth that is in line with or faster than the market. The Abaxis integration is well underway and will allow us to unlock the value of the revenue growth opportunities in the diagnostic market and further support our customers across the full continuum of care. We will also continue to invest both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders.","Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks. On U.S. livestock, can you speak to the quarterly progression and your visibility there on in the second half? I guess, particularly across the cattle segment in particular, and how confident you are in sort of a better trend there? And then also maybe some of the seasonal aspect on the U.S. companion animal business? And how we should be thinking about the quarterly progression there as well? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Erin. And, well, we see the U.S. livestock has not changed compared to previous projections. Despite of the trade situation, we expect that the U.S. livestock will be showing positive growth in 2018.","We also mentioned at the beginning of the year that on this market growth, we expect cattle and poultry product is already growing in line with the market, and swine growing faster than the market and our forecast remain the same.","The only change compared to what we estimated at the beginning of the year was the dairy segment, where the performance is below expectations for the market, and we also expected a recovery in the second half. And now our estimate is it will be taking longer and will not be until 2019.","Just to summarize our performance in the first half. So livestock grew in the U.S. by 2%. And for total Zoetis the growth was 5%. And this confirms again that our geographical diversity is helping us to manage our economic cycles, regulatory changes or now even trade war. The fundamentals of livestock remain the same and the consumption of animal proteins to continue growing, and the needed to keep animals healthy and productive is the same as we have been communicating before.","So with all these, we expect that at end of the year, livestock in the U.S. and also the livestock worldwide will be growing and we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. Maybe also Glenn can add to my comments on the second half of the year.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Erin, just one thing to consider as you look at the quarterly progression of livestock in the second half, just a reminder that in Q4 of 2017 in the U.S. in particular, we had a particularly strong U.S. livestock performance in growth across all of its species. So that will be a challenge to growth in Q4 in particular.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions for me, Juan Ram\u00f3n and Glenn. First off, clearly you guys have laid out a roadmap and strategy for your monoclonal antibodies with Nexvet, Cytopoint and now the collaboration with Regeneron. Could you talk more about, I guess how that's going to develop beyond osteoarthritis and pain? What are other indications you could look for both in companion and maybe even livestock?","And then for the second half of the year, organic growth has been really strong the first half. What factors have you considered in the guidance for the back half besides the tough comps? Have you input anything there for the potential impacts on the tariffs and other livestock headwinds that you just talked about? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I will cover the monoclonal antibody question and then Glenn will respond on the organic growth in the second quarter. Definitely, monoclonal antibodies is an area of significant investment for Zoetis. We have seen first opportunities for Cytopoint and this has been something that is developing extremely well. So the reaction of the market has been exceeding the initial expectations. And we also saw opportunities on developing products, as you said, for osteoarthritis, pain, and also very important attacks (32:39). These programs are progressing very well. We are combining many different programs that came from Nexvet, but also internal programs as they were part of our R&D activity.","And beyond pain, we also see opportunities in renal, we see opportunities on oncology, and we are also developing programs for livestock. These programs are not as advanced as companion animal, but we remain confident that also monoclonal antibodies will provide opportunities in livestock, especially in feed enhancement. That is an area that also we'll be replacing existing technologies with new technologies that will be more acceptable for consumers for retailers. Glenn?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","And, Kevin, in terms of your question in terms of the applied slower organic growth in the second half of the year, it is really mainly driven by the tough comps that we have, particularly in Q4, and again related to U.S. livestock.","Just a couple of other things to point out, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have four fewer calendar days in the International business in Q4 of 2018 versus Q4 2017, which also provides a tougher comp. And then there are just, as you look at some of our growth portfolio, particularly derm, the growth comes off of a higher base as we mature through the year. So those are some of the factors that would indicate slightly slower growth in the second half of the year versus the first half.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take the next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. So a question on poultry for you. One of the major producers recently remarked that chicken demand was a little bit sluggish, and that's end market chicken demand. I believe they cited other meats being cheaper than normal as the cause. Do you see any impact to your poultry business in the near and medium term as a result of these dynamics?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","We have seen that \u2013 for us, the poultry business has been performing very well in this first half. We continue creating growth in the second half. So as we explained many times, maybe some market they will be facing some challenge. But the consumption of chicken is growing, and we have seen growth in many international markets. Maybe the only area where we saw some negative evolution was Brazil, and this was a result of also the strike, where the transportation strike was limiting the transportation of food to some of the poultry farms, and this created somewhat challenging situation for producers.","But Brazil is where we had probably the lesser penetration in terms of poultry. Overall, we remained positive about poultry. And in poultry, we have not only vaccines and pharmaceuticals, but we're also providing devices for vaccination, in-ovo vaccination. And also we have to be adding also automation with (36:08). So overall we remain positive about poultry. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify some of the points of your guidance raise. We've been getting questions on that this morning. So first thing is just on the Abaxis portion. Can you clarify if that was actually accretive or dilutive from a model line perspective, and how that's changed or has that stayed the same to what you've previously said? And then maybe a little bit more color on the tax element of the change in the guidance? And then was this upside for organic growth in the second half of 2018? Thanks.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","So in terms of Abaxis and its impact to EPS, so similar to what we've indicated prior, in 2018 we do expect Abaxis to be slightly dilutive to earnings when you include the funding of the acquisition. We do expect that our first full year of operations when we're able to generate both the revenue upside and some of the expense savings that we expect to generate that it will be slightly accretive to earnings. So we do expect it to be accretive to earnings in 2019. But in 2018, it is slightly dilutive.","In terms of the tax change and the guidance, we have previously guided to an adjusted effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. Because of some favorable discrete items that we've experienced year to date and some of that we may experience in the following quarters as well, we've updated that guidance to approximately 20%. But again, those are just certain discrete items that don't necessarily carry forward into 2019 and beyond.","In terms of the organic growth for the second half of the year, again similar, I think, to some of the comments that we've made. We do have certain challenges, particularly in Q4 of 2017 (sic) [2018] from a prior-year comp perspective that will negatively impact our growth. And also we do have a four fewer calendar days in the International segment in Q4.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Congrats on another strong quarter guys. A couple of quick questions. One on the Simparica Trio that you announced, just a little bit more clarity into the timing and the expectations forward and the market, any expectation for U.S. versus Europe? And I recognize, a lot of that's up to the regulatory agencies. And then on the 2020 timing is it more about \u2013 should we think about it the same way as we do all the flea and tick drugs where you want to launch 1Q to sort of be fully ramped by the mid-year summer and therefore that's why you're a little cautious with the regulatory pathways?","And then on the SG&A really quick, you've highlighted earlier throughout the year that the increased OpEx both SG&A and R&D sort of just reinvest back in the business? And then with the updated guidance today, I just want to be clear. Is the guide update for SG&A and R&D entirely just rolling Abaxis into the model, or is there any incremental spend? And you talk about the spend you're doing in the diagnostics sales force that you talked about earlier?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. On Simparica Trio, as you said, it depends on regulatory approvals. But as I said, we feel confident that the registration packets of these products is strong and we'll be able really to gain approval to launch the product in 2020.","Definitely we'll be launching the product in the first quarter. But we don't know at this point it will be in the first quarter or midyear. So definitely we'll be working to accelerate as much as possible all the approval. But it depends on third-parties approval and we don't know exactly when we'll be able to bring this product into the market. And Glenn will cover the question on OpEx.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, Mike, in terms of SG&A and R&D, as you did mention a big part of the raise in the guidance there is related to Abaxis. But there are other operational factors driving some incremental R&D and SG&A. We mentioned the acquisition of Smartbow, while not material from upfront investment perspective. There are certain ongoing costs to developing those products and they hit both the SG&A and the R&D line. So that's another key area of growth in SG&A and R&D.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And, Mike, I don't think I responded about the timing for the U.S. and Europe. In both big market we expect approval in 2020. So, next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. I joined the call late, so I apologize if any of these questions were asked. But could you please comment on the key considerations for the third quarter, sequentially, relative to the second quarter of 2018 that you just reported? And then, if you could provide any updates on the triple combo? Once again I joined late, so if you're already addressed you could ignore that? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. And that's all right. I just answered the question on the Simparica Trio. I mentioned that we expect this product to reach the market in 2020 in both U.S. and International. International will be European Union. And Glenn, do you want to answer the question on the sequential?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Sure. In terms of any sequential guidance. So, obviously, we don't necessarily guide to any particular quarter. But in terms of any major changes to growth, it really is the Q4 2018 drivers that we referenced are the things to note. In our Q3, no major changes versus the first half of the year.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just I have a couple longer term questions. One, it seems inevitable that there will be more competition in atopic dermatitis space. My question is whether you think those new (42:44) launches can come on fast enough and be large enough and profitable enough so that you can continue companion growth in revenue and profits continuously over the next three to five years? And secondly, I realize it's very early on Abaxis. But I was hoping you could talk, at least preliminarily, about the longer term opportunity to leverage that new capability across the food animal setting? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. Well, we mentioned usually that we expect competition for our derm portfolio. We expect competition in the future for Apoquel and also for Cytopoint. We have now very strong position in the market. We also have a product that has demonstrated very strong, safety and efficacy profile. And we are very confident that we will be able to continue defending our franchise successfully in the future. Definitely we have been growing very fast. We expect that at some point we will be reaching a level of penetration that will be difficult to continue growing. But we still have a lot of opportunities in International markets where we far off reaching this level of penetration in terms of patients.","And in some countries like China the product is not available and we expect Apoquel reaching China and also generating very positive growth. So in summary we are confident that we have very strong position, we have great two products, and definitely we expect that we will be able to protect and defend this franchise that has been created by Zoetis. In terms of Abaxis, we see both short-term and long-term opportunities. We mentioned that the short-term will be for International markets where the level of use of diagnostic tools is extremely lower than in the U.S. And now with our presence and the combination of our portfolio with diagnostics and adding the field force that we have in International market we expect to generate short-term growth.","In longer term definitely we see two opportunities. One is to continue bring innovation and we are confident that with Abaxis together with SMB and also our internal groups, we'll be able to continue bring the innovation in companion animals, but also very important now with Abaxis, we have the opportunity to reassign resources to develop a portfolio for livestock. And in livestock we see a significant opportunity in where there is no any existing diagnostic company having any penetration in this market. This market is served mainly from reference lab, farmers or veterinarians in livestock sending samples to reference labs, getting the information back in one to three days.","We see the opportunities of bringing point-of-care diagnostic tools into the farms and creating an information that will be very important to protect the animals and also may be with the opportunity also to expand the use and the compliance in livestock.","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, this is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. I have two questions. One with the Abaxis deal now closed, can you provide more color on the cost efficiencies and where we can expect that to come from? You have mentioned that you continue to expect the 200 basis points improvement in gross margins, but can you help us think about how we should think about the operating margins with respect to your accretion in 2019 and longer term as well?","The second question following-up on an earlier question on the dermatology franchise, given the momentum \u2013 and you said that the U.S. will reach a level of penetration soon \u2013 can you help frame expectations of what do you think that franchise could look like in terms of peak sales or at what level of sales do you think that they would get to maturity? Thank you so much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, thank you. And maybe a clarification on the level of penetration in the U.S. In the U.S. in the second quarter, we have reached 61% patient share, so we still see opportunities to continue to growing in this franchise. What I'm saying is that, well, we will be reaching in the future a level of penetration that that will be difficult to continue growing but not at this point. At this point, we still see two opportunities in the U.S. One is increasing the awareness and increasing the demand for treating dermatology issues and also increasing the penetration on patient share. Then moving to the cost efficiency in Abaxis, Glenn, do you want to cover this question?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. So, in terms of the impact of Abaxis on our margins moving forward, so from a gross margin perspective, cost of goods for Abaxis are a little higher than what we have for the remaining portfolio of Zoetis. So it will be somewhat of a negative impact but we still do expect to achieve the 200 basis points of improvement from 2017 to 2020 within our gross margins.","When you think about more to an operating margin level because of our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure, we do believe that over the next coming years we'll achieve the same operating margins that we would have without Abaxis. So we expect to be able to continue to grow our operating margin but, again, the focus continues to be on growing cash and profitable income growth.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And maybe one comment on the cost efficiencies in Abaxis. So the Abaxis acquisition is not driven by cost efficiency. We will be generating short-term cost efficiencies but the cost efficiency will be fully realized in the 2019.","You also ask about this 200 basis points of improvement in cost. Maybe, Glenn, you can cover that. Many of these costs has been already generated in 2018, so it's not that we are still targeting 200 basis points of improvement from now, so some of this has been also coming in this quarter.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, the 200 basis point improvement, as we mentioned, was off the 2017 base where our cost of goods was approximately 33% at that period of time. We've guided for 2018 approximately 32%, so we'd expect about 100 basis point improvement year-over-year, which would then lead to about another 100 basis point improvement by the year 2020. So we're well on our way to achieving that goal and expect to be able to deliver that.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Westenberg with C.L. King. Please go ahead.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Some quick ones on Abaxis. Do you anticipate any product repositioning with Abaxis, particularly in context with how you're going to sell the products SMB products and CARYSTA? And then as a follow-up to that, just on \u2013 the 10-Q hasn't dropped yet, so just where in the product segmentation are you going to be putting Abaxis? Thank you very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, now we have a combined portfolio with Abaxis\/SMB, but we don't think that at this point there are products which are in conflict or in competition. They are products that can be managed very well. And now we have the opportunity to combine the field force of Abaxis that has been increasing in 2018. And with our field force and the plan now \u2013 from now to the next coming months is to ensure that both field forces are fully aligned and both field forces they have their level of technical information that will be supporting this new portfolio. So we are very confident that we'll be defending Abaxis in international markets as well as in the U.S. with now stronger presence in the market.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","And in terms of Abaxis reporting, Abaxis is going to be fully integrated into our operating structure, so therefore it will not be reported as a standalone segment. We will, however, provide transparency to the revenue performance of the diagnostics business moving forward. Just one point, you mentioned this quarter's 10-Q. since we did not own the business in Q2, we'll not be reporting on Abaxis revenues within the 10-Q.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, thank you and good morning. Could you please comment on the recent announcement from the FDA about a new five-year blueprint regarding antimicrobial stewardship? How is this incrementally different relative to the prior initiatives and directives and what the impact could be for you?","And I apologize if I missed this but could you provide Apoquel and Cytopoint sales by U.S. and ex-U.S. as well as for Simparica? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you for the questions, Alex. I think that the FDA five-year blueprint, in our opinion, is consistent with previous approaches in terms of anti-infectives or antibiotics. We don't think that this will have a significant negative impact to Zoetis. We already mentioned that in antibiotics we expect that they will be growing maybe half of the growth rate of the animal health industry. This is part of our model. This is part of our prediction.","We continue also working on having a portfolio that is much more balanced and less dependent on antibiotics. If you compare the portfolio of antibiotics or the weight of our revenues in 2013 through the weight of antibiotics in 2018, this has been decreased significantly. But we are still very confident that we have a very strong portfolio of antibiotics \u2013 injectables and antibiotics that can be used by veterinarians in a way that is protecting animals and not creating additional resistance in human health. So we are confident that we'll be able really to maintain our position and support our portfolio of antibiotics.","You also asked about the breakdown between dermatology sales U.S.-International as well as Simparica. Glenn?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","In terms of total derm sales for the quarter, we had $143 million in total. Of that, $100 million was the U.S., $42 million was International, so obviously some rounding there.","In terms of Apoquel for the quarter, we had total sales of $110 million, with $73 million being the U.S. and $37 million being International. And with that, you could calculate Cytopoint. From a Simparica perspective, we had total sales of $51 million, with $30 million being U.S. and $21 million International.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. I have two questions. First, on your first quarter call you provided a nice update on the potential impact of tariffs or lack thereof on your U.S. pork business \u2013 swine business. Could you give us an update as things have progressed since then, and maybe also comment whether the increased tariffs in Mexico are having any impact to your outlook?","And the second question is on aquaculture. I don't think we've talked about that today. Just give us an update. I know the second half of the year is usually stronger. Do you expect that to continue, and what kind of growth can we look for later this year and into 2019? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Kathy. The impact from tariffs is something that is evolving every day, because it can be a \u2013 maybe some additional tariff applied to China. But our estimate for 2018 is that there definitely will be some small impact on swine because of the exportations to China.","But to put things into perspective, so the total swine in the U.S. represent about 3% of our total revenues. 80% of the production in the U.S. is for local consumption and 20% is for export. On this 20%, 10% to 12% is exportations to China. So even if there may be some impact, the total revenues exported to China or as royalty, represent less than 0.1%.","So definitely it's an area that we are concerned because it's affecting our customers in the U.S. But at the same time, as I mentioned, before our global presence it's also protecting us for this type of economic cycles or regulatory situations or even trade wars. And we know that the consumption would remain strong, and we have a significant presence of swine activity in many other parts of the world.","You had also asked about Pharmaq performance in the second quarter. Glenn, do you want to comment on that?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes, so Pharmaq had sales of $24 million in Q2, which was growth of about 13% operationally, which is really driven by the increased adoption of our LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. As we did indicate previously, 2018 we don't expect to achieve the same level of growth as we saw in 2017, as in 2017 we saw very rapid adoption of the PD vaccine in Norway, as we displaced a competitor following a legal victory. That being said there, we still expect Pharmaq to grow at a faster pace than the overall Zoetis business in 2018.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much for the questions. Just a couple on Abaxis and the International opportunity. I think you mentioned that as a shorter-term growth opportunity, but when we think about the ramp of that business and taking advantage of your larger footprint, is that something where we just expect a significant step up in 2019, or is that a multiyear process?","And when you think longer term about the Abaxis mix, I think Zoetis right now is about 50% U.S., 50% ex-U.S. by revenue. Is it reasonable to think about Abaxis getting into that type of split over time?","And then my final question was just a quick update on capital deployment priorities post the transaction. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. Well, first, we're penetrating International markets with the new portfolio of diagnostic equipment; we are now building the presence in this International market. When I say building the presence, we need to have the technical people that will be in charge of selling and also installing and the plan is use our existing field force to complement this effort.","This was already planned even before the acquisition of Abaxis, because when we acquired SMB, we saw the opportunity of building this infrastructure to support the future portfolio. Now with Abaxis, we are accelerating even more these plans to have the presence that we think is needed to support the growth in International markets. But it's something that we've planned to generate \u2013 well, most of this impact will be coming in 2019 and the following years.","You were asking about the long-term. It could be reaching 50%-50%. I think it's too early to say. And we still need to have a better understanding of what will be the level adoption of equipment in International markets. Again, so International markets is a combination of developed market with developing markets. And \u2013 well, definitely it will be part of our analysis \u2013 full analysis and also we'll be really targeting to maximize opportunities. But at this point, it's difficult to predict it will be 50%-50%.","In terms of capital allocation, Glenn will cover, but there is no change and we remain committed with the principles that we communicated before. Glenn?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes, Chris, as Juan Ram\u00f3n indicated, there really is no change to our capital allocation and priorities moving forward. When you look at the current level of operating cash flow that we have and the strength of our balance sheet, we're able to fund almost the full consideration and still stay within our targeted gross debt to adjusted EBITDA range of 2.5 to 3. So that still leaves us the financial flexibility to fund future strategic investments and also return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So really no change to our capital allocation priorities post-Abaxis.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Actually all my follow up questions have been answered. Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you.

I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our performance through the first nine months has been consistent with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Companion animal has continued to drive our revenue growth in 2017, based on an innovative dermatology portfolio, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, and other new products and lifecycle innovations.","We have also accelerated our revenues and adjusted earnings and improved our margins in the third quarter, as our cost improvement have become more fully reflected in our results. We expect these to continue for the rest of the year, as reflected in our updated guidance.","We are also delivering our strong performance, despite the negative impact of the implementation in the U.S. of the Veterinary Feed Directive. This has had a higher and lower impact on the U.S. cattle and swine businesses than we initially expected.","Once again, the diversity of our portfolio is helping us to deliver consistent result and grow further in the market, despite these and other challenges, such as economic crisis, political instability, and regulatory changes.","Our results are enhancing our financial strength. And we continue investing our capital and resources internal and external opportunities. We are executing our plans for future growth, and we are confident in our raised guidance for full year 2017.","In the third quarter, our revenue grew 8% operationally. And we are at 7% operational growth for the first nine months of the year. The main driver for our third quarter revenue growth remains companion animal products, which grew an impressive 19% operationally and 13% through the first nine month. This was driven largely by sales of our industry leading dermatology portfolio consisting of Apoquel and Cytopoint, our new oral parasiticide, Simparica, and several other new companion animal products.","In the U.S., companion animal products grew 21%, and in international markets, they grew 15% operationally. We continue to expand our business in dermatology. Our latest data in the U.S. shows that 59% of dogs with dermatology conditions are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 55% in the second quarter. Cytopoint has now been fully launched in the fourth quarter in European Union, and we expect to generate further Cytopoint growth in these countries.","As a result of the success in the U.S. and continued expansion in other international market, our global dermatology portfolio achieved $124 million in sales in the third quarter, up from $102 million in the second quarter.","Through the first nine months of the year, our dermatology revenue is at $303 million. And now, we expect peak sales of more than $500 million. Simparica sales also increased in the third quarter. And we continue to track well with our expectations for the year in this large, but highly competitive market. We obtained approvals in new markets like Japan and Taiwan. And expect to launch in the first quarter of 2018. We remain confident in the blockbuster potential of this product.","The direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns for Apoquel and Simparica, which began in the second quarter in the U.S. have had a positive impact on sales and are in line with our expectations. We have been able to support disease awareness for atopic dermatitis, and have established more brand recognition and product differentiation for Simparica, as a superior flea and tick protection.","Meanwhile, our livestock portfolio grew 2% operationally, with increases in fish, poultry, and swine products, offset by a decline in cattle products. In fish products, we increased our third quarter sales 52% operationally, roughly equal to our total sales for the first half of this year. This strong performance was driven by the launch of a new vaccine in Norway to prevent pancreatic disease in salmon. And we have also worked with customers in Chile and seen a resumption of strong sales there for our SRS vaccine for salmon.","We feel very positive about these new two products for farm fish, and we continue to lead the vaccine market for supporting the salmon production. Our expansion into vaccines for other fish species in other global markets will help drive future growth for our fish business.","In the case of poultry products, we grew 7% operationally. We continue to generate strong growth in the U.S., where our expertise and broad product portfolio are helping customers address evolving consumer and retailer preferences. Using our Poulvac vaccine and medicated feed additive such as Zoamix, Robenz or Deccox is helping certain producers, who are choosing to shift to no-antibiotic-ever production.","In the third quarter, our swine products grew 1% operationally, led by strong international sales of our Suvaxyn PCV combo product and by sales of Improvac in Brazil. The growth was offset by decline in the U.S. pork business, but our updated PCV M-Hyo vaccine in the U.S. continues to demonstrate good customer adoption. We believe our U.S. pork business is positioned to return it to at\/or above market growth in 2018.","Overall, our U.S. swine business and U.S. cattle business, were both impacted by ongoing implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, which caused changes to some producer's protocol for use of medicated feed additive.","In the cattle market, our sales declined 2% operationally. This decline was driven by the U.S., mainly due to the VFD implementation, as well as the impact of promotional activities last year and healthier animals.","We continue to see positive growth in other major beef markets like Brazil, Argentina, and Australia. We also still see positive signs related to the export from the U.S. and increasing herd size in 2017 and into 2018. We expect our U.S. cattle business will return to growth in the fourth quarter.","As for earnings in the third quarter, we posted 25% operational growth in adjusted net income, significantly faster than revenue growth of 8%. And year to-date, we have generated 16% operational growth in adjusted net income.","Our value proposition for shareholders has always been based on growing adjusted net income faster than sales, while making the right investment in our commercial, R&D, and manufacturing capabilities to ensure long-term profitable revenue growth.","In terms of innovation in the third quarter, the European Commission granted us approval for a new addition to the Suvaxyn\/Fostera family of vaccines for swine. This new product is a modified live vaccine that protect pigs against their porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome, one of the most common diseases affecting swine herds.","Also in the third quarter, Zoetis extended its poultry portfolio with the approval of the new Poulvac vaccine in Korea to prevent certain local strains of infectious diseases. We are also continuing with our supply network strategy to support our new products and long-term growth. Manufacturing is critical to our past and future success.","Over the last few years, we have eliminated a number of low volume products from our portfolio and reduced our manufacturing footprint to improve our overall efficiency. While we still have the imminent sale of our Guarulhos plant in Brazil to complete, we also have several opportunities to invest and position our manufacturing network to best support our portfolio; secure manufacturing control over high value products and improve their cost.","For example, we plan to build a new manufacturing facility in China. This site will expand our capacity to develop and manufacture vaccine for swine, cattle, and farm fish for the Chinese market. It would also serve as a central research center in China. We anticipate breaking ground in spring of 2018.","In October, we also acquired the remaining 55% ownership stake in the Jilin Zoetis Guoyuan joint venture from our partners in China. And now we have sole ownership of the JV, which was founded in 2011 to produce swine vaccines.","In Ireland, we recently acquired the former MSD manufacturing site in Rathdrum. This facility will give us better control of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are used in many of our key products. It will also make us less dependent on third parties and improve our long-term cost for these durable assets. We have also announced plans to expand manufacturing capacity at our facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan to support more products like Simparica, and we expect to complete those renovations by early 2019.","And in Charles City, Iowa, we are finalizing plans to expand our site and increase capacity for new poultry vaccines in the coming years. All represent important uses of our capital to build and ensure our capacity for growth.","In summary, we continue to use our direct sales presence, our diverse and innovative portfolio of our products and high quality manufacturing network to achieve our financial goals in the first nine months of the year. As we move into the fourth quarter, we are raising our full-year 2017 guidance for revenue and net income based on our continued confidence in our performance.","With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and full-year guidance.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter with top line growth coming from our dermatology portfolio and new companion animal products, and with strong performance from our international livestock portfolio in key markets, including Brazil, Australia, Japan, and Mexico.","Total company revenue grew 8% operationally, excluding a favorable 1% impact from foreign exchange. Of that 8%, 4% came from dermatology products, 4% came from Simparica and other new products, and the remaining portfolio was relatively flat. Unlike recent quarters, our product rationalization has limited impact on our growth this quarter, and we expect the same for the fourth quarter.","Now, a few revenue highlight. Our dermatology portfolio once again surpassed the $100 million mark with $124 million in sales in the quarter. As we've indicated in the past, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis in the U.S.","Sales of Simparica were $25 million in the quarter, growing 280% over the prior year and 21% sequentially. In terms of the bottom line, we delivered 25% operational growth in both adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS.","We were able to achieve this significant level of growth due to the full year impact of cost reductions from our operational efficiency initiative, as well as leveraging our infrastructure. Our performance in this quarter is another example of our ability to execute on our value proposition of growing adjusted earnings faster than sales over the long-term.","Now on to segment revenue. Our International segment generated operational revenue growth of 11%, while the U.S. grew 6%. Our International segment displayed balanced growth across both species and markets. This growth is a testament to our diversity, not only from a product portfolio perspective, but geographically as well.","Turning to some key markets in the quarter. Starting with Australia; favorable market conditions for livestock drove growth of 19% operationally. Higher sheep prices combined with greater market penetration of our vaccine contributed to growth. And the beef cattle herd in Australia continued its expansion following several years of drought. In companion animal, our growth was driven by Apoquel. In Brazil, we grew 14% operationally in the quarter, behind the strength of both our livestock and companion animal businesses.","In livestock, investments we have made to expand our field force, in addition to favorable market conditions continue to contribute to growth in cattle product. In swine, increased sales of Improvac were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. Meanwhile, higher companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparica, as it's known in Brazil.","Switching to China. We delivered another strong quarter, growing 22% operationally with growth coming from our companion animal vaccines business. Underlying demand for our vaccines remain strong due to improving medicalization rates and a growing population, and growth in the quarter was aided by supply resumption of one of our vaccines.","Revenue in Japan declined 3% operationally in the quarter, due to a difficult comparison with the third quarter of 2016, when we experienced a significant initial stocking of Apoquel with wholesalers. Inventory levels have stabilized and we see a healthy rate of sales for Apoquel in Japan, driven by strong demand.","PHARMAQ, which is reflected in other developed and other emerging markets, experienced significant growth in the quarter. This was driven by our recently introduced vaccine for pancreatic disease in Norway, as well as in-line product growth across various markets, including Chile. Norway and Chile are the two largest farmed salmon markets in the world, which combined, account for approximately 80% of global farmed salmon production.","To summarize, a very strong quarter for our International segment with growth across the diversified portfolio, including all of our core species and key markets. This performance was driven by a combination of favorable market conditions, strategic investments, and our ability to consistently drive commercial results.","Turning to the U.S.; revenue grew 6% in the third quarter. Companion animal grew 21% in the quarter, while livestock declined by 6%. Companion animal product sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio, Simparica, and a number of other recently launched products. U.S. dermatology sales were $89 million for the quarter with Cytopoint sales reaching $20 million in the U.S., exhibiting nice growth over both the prior year, as well as on a sequential basis.","In addition, as Juan Ram\u00f3n previously mentioned, we continue to see increasing penetration in total patient share reaching almost 60% in the quarter. This performance also resulted in 80% revenue share of the market. With the premium nature of our dermatology products, we are significantly expanding the size of the market, as we continue to grow patient share. Simparica grew significantly over the same quarter last year as our direct-to-consumer investment, field force focus, and other promotions led to higher clinic penetration.","Additional contributions to companion animal growth came from new product launches, including Diroban, a recently approved product for the treatment of heartworm, and a number of line extension for our Vanguard vaccine franchise.","Moving to U.S. livestock, sales declined 6% in the quarter, due to the performance of our cattle and swine businesses that more than offset robust growth in our poultry business. Declining sales in our cattle business have been impacted by a number of factors, including the impact of promotional activities in the prior year, lower disease risk, and incidence, as well as the continued implementation of the Veterinary Feed Directive and its impact on Aureomycin sales.","On a year-to-date basis, the impact of the VFD on our cattle and swine business has been approximately $30 million. Our swine business declined again this quarter in the U.S., primarily due to competition in PCV\/M. Hyo vaccine market, as well as the continued implementation of VFD.","On the positive side, our updated PCV\/M. Hyo vaccine continues to gain traction with small and medium sized producers. Hence, in U.S. poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotic medicated feed additive continues to be the primary driver of growth, as certain producers expand their No Antibiotics Ever label. Our portfolio is well positioned to address these evolving industry practices.","Now, turning to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 67.9% increased approximately 40 basis points on a reported basis versus prior year, and on a sequential quarter basis improved 230 basis points in the second quarter of this year. Our cost in this quarter, reflect the impact of cost improvements in our manufacturing network, as the higher cost inventory from 2016 has largely worked its way through our P&L, as expected.","Adjusted SG&A declined by 2% in the quarter, as we continue to see the full impact of the expense reductions from our operational efficiency initiatives. Adjusted R&D expense increased 6% for the quarter, due primarily to the timing of project spending and incremental R&D associated with recent acquisitions.","Operating expenses, in total, were flat versus the same period last year and they reflect significant decreased spending in G&A. Those savings are being reallocated to value generating investments in commercial operations and innovation, including direct-to-consumer advertising, field force expansion, and increased R&D.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 29%. It has significantly improved from the prior year, due to the impact of the favorable jurisdictional mix of earnings. The year-over-year improvement in our adjusted effective tax rate was a driver of operational adjusted net income growth and contributed 5% in operational growth to the overall 25% for the quarter.","Moving to guidance, for full year 2017, our consistent top line performance through the year, success of productive investment, as well as effective discipline on costs are allowing us to improve our outlook for both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS.","For the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue guidance, and we now expect to deliver between $5.225 billion and $5.275 billion at revenue. The increase to our revenue expectation for the year is due to continued strength in our international business and the acceleration of our normal annual price increase in U.S. livestock to harmonize the timing of our price increases across our business. Our guidance for adjusted cost of sales for the full year continues to be approximately 33%, as we expect the continuation of the improvement we saw in Q3.","For SG&A, we're increasing the range to reflect variable costs associated with our higher outlook at revenue. We've increased the lower end of adjusted R&D spend, as we continue to invest in future growth.","Our guidance for the adjusted estimated tax rate of approximately 29% is consistent with our prior view and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington. With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us.","As a result of the changes above, we have increased below and high-end for operational adjusted net income and now expect growth of 18% to 21%, corresponding with adjusted EPS expectations of $2.34 per share to $2.39 per share.","In the third quarter, we also repurchased another $125 million in shares. And our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the share repurchases completed through Q3. In September, we announced a senior debt offering of $1.25 billion. The financing was completed as favorable long-term rate with a blended coupon of 3.38%. $750 million of these proceeds were used in October to retire debt that was scheduled to mature in the first quarter of 2018. The additional debt added to our balance sheet will align our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio within our preferred range of between 2.5 times and 3.0 times, as well as add incremental interest expense for the remainder of the year, which we have incorporated into guidance.","Again, looking forward to 2018, we will have growth in our interest expense, based both on the higher debt balances, as well as the longer-term nature of the new debt.","So just to summarize before we go to Q&A, we are undertaking a number of activities that serve as an indication of our commitment to sustainable and profitable growth. In manufacturing, we are investing in additional capacity for new products, building sites in important emerging markets and bringing strategic products under our full control, while improving cost. In R&D, we continue to invest in a range of innovation, from new novel compound and extending the life of existing brand to groundbreaking platform technologies, such as monoclonal antibodies.","In our commercial operation, we've invested in direct-to-consumer advertising to raise awareness and grow the market for important new products, as well as expanded our field force presence in fast growing markets like China and Brazil.","We continue to look for new external business development opportunities and invest in the recently acquired businesses, including Nexvet for unmet needs in chronic pain and PHARMAQ for farm fish, which experienced significant growth in the quarter.","With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik actually. Thanks for all the color on the quarter in terms of the moving parts for the companion animal portfolio and livestock as well. I was just wondering you mentioned that you expect U.S. cattle to return to growth in the fourth quarter. In terms of the impact you saw in the current quarter, could you breakdown how much of it was the lower incidence of disease risk versus the MFA headwinds?","And then a quick follow-up in terms of volume and price contribution overall in the quarter. It sounds like you didn't see any price benefit. Is there an expectation that you will return to sort of 100 bps to 200 bps in 4Q and going forward, and what were the drivers of that? Thanks again.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, thank you, Mike. So definitely, we expect the U.S. cattle return to growth in the fourth quarter. You ask what were the drivers of the impact on the third quarter. Definitely, some of the impacts have been related to the Veterinary Feed Directive that had more permanent and higher impact that we initially estimated. So this has been year-to-date, as Glenn mentioned, something like $30 million. The other impact that was specific to the quarter, was some promotional activities that we did in the third quarter of last year that we didn't repeat this year. And this had a negative impact in this quarter.","And finally, we have seen that the animals because of the weather condition has been showing healthier conditions, and this has been mainly affected the use of some premium antibiotics. We expect this type of things being corrected in the fourth quarter, and then, as I said in the fourth quarter showing a positive growth in U.S. cattle.","Then the second question was about price volume, and Glenn will respond to that.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes. So Mike, in terms of price and volume, for the overall business we saw about 8% volume growth and relatively flat price. And that flat price is really driven by two things. A, we saw positive price movements in international as we were able to take advantage of inflationary markets. And then, we did slightly decline in the U.S. in price in the quarter, really just driven by certain promotions that we had in the quarter. Over the long-term, we still expect to return to positive price increasing for the business.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on a nice quarter. Juan Ram\u00f3n, I guess starting off with the aquaculture business, really strong growth driven by Norway. Can you talk about that new product that you launched, and is that also available in Chile and how big do you think aquaculture can be over time for you guys?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, the product that we launched in Norway is specific to Norway. It's pancreatic disease that there is a vaccine or it's a condition that is quite prevalent in some part of Norway. And we were not participating in this business. Now, we have a vaccine and this vaccine is performing extremely well, and also having a positive impact in the rest of the portfolio. We are not expecting that pancreatic disease affecting Chile, but in Chile for instance we have the SRS disease, which is not affecting Norway. So we \u2013 as in many other parts of our business some of the diseases are very specific to countries or regions that's why we need to also \u2013 to respond to these diseases. We have different products depending on countries of origin.","This year, we initially forecasted $125 million in revenues for the farm fish because we had some challenge in the second quarter in Chile also related to this SRS vaccine. We had some negative impact in the quarter that has been solved in the third quarter, and we expect continue growing on the SRS in Chile. But because of the impact of the second quarter, we have adjusted our projection for the year, about $110 million, $115 million.","Long term, I think we expect that this business will be growing faster than the average of the animal health industry, animal health industry growing at 5% to 6%. We expect the farm fish growing faster, especially the area of vaccines in where we are leading, and we expect that we will continue bringing innovation to the market.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thank you very much for taking the questions. First, I just want to clarify, I understood the comments on U.S. livestock correctly. So you not only expect to return to growth in 4Q, but you expect in line with the market growth in 2018, and could you tell us what your expectations for the market is?","And then, just a broader question, Glenn, I think you said 4% of the growth is coming from derm, 4% of the growth is coming from Simparica, and the rest of business was flat. That clearly doesn't \u2013 that clearly implies that you need new products for growth. And the issues on the U.S. livestock aside, I just want to get a better sense as to how you think you're competitively positioned, and particularly the derm space, I'm sure this growth hasn't gone unnoticed by your competitors. So, as these launches moderate, A, how do you think, you will compete relative to the competitors? And yeah, I'll stop there. Thank you very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Alex. I will respond to the U.S. livestock question first, and then we'll discuss about the competitive landscape in dermatology. So first, as I said that we expect the fourth quarter, the U.S. cattle business returning to growth. In the U.S., the poultry business is doing very well. Pork has been challenging during the year.","In both cases, cattle and pork or swine, we expect growth in 2018. I mentioned that in the swine or pork business, we expect to grow at or above market growth. In the case of cattle, what we see is that there are positive factors; export remains strong. We expect also that the number of animals will continue growing in 2018. The market is a little bit more positive now about the expansion of herd than some month ago.","And the other element that we expect also will have a positive impact in our revenues will be the products affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive, has been rebased. And in terms of growth, we don't expect any significant impact in 2018. So all these elements make us confident that the livestock in general for the U.S. will be showing positive numbers.","One of the things that is always important to remember is that, we have a portfolio, which is highly diverse in terms of geographies. And we know that in some cases we'll be facing challenge \u2013 one market that will be compensated with maybe acceleration of revenues in other market, which is what is happening in 2017. And we continue to expect that this will be an element that will provide more sustainable and predictable growth in our business.","The second question was about competitive landscape in dermatology. Today, we are only competing with steroids, we are competing with some other products that are creating probably not significant revenues in this market. We expect that in the future, some of our competitors will bring products into the market. This is an area that we show that it's a significant opportunity.","Now, we are projecting more than $500 million combining Apoquel\/Cytopoint. So, it's something that definitely we can expect in the future. But just as a reference, so for us developing Apoquel took about eight years, Cytopoint seven years. So, even if competitors now are reacting based on the success that we are delivering, definitely yeah, I think we feel comfortable that in the coming years, we'll maintain our very strong position in the market.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, now that you've optimized your operating platform, how do we or how should we think about your cash flow generation going forward, and how do you prioritize this cash?","And then, the second thing here is just that you had a very robust gross margin this quarter, how sustainable is that going forward? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","I will ask Glenn to cover these two questions. Thank you, Louise.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, from a cash flow generation perspective, I think when you look at 2017, we've guided that we see our operating cash flow pretty closely approximating adjusted net income and that implies significant growth in cash flow this year, as we get out of lot of the cost related to our operational efficiency initiative, the implementation of SAP and other cost. And we continue to expect to drive cash flow growth at a faster pace than adjusted net income, as we do have opportunities in working capital, particularly in inventory that we'll continue to leverage.","In terms of the gross margin, so we saw nice improvement in gross margin in Q3. And just as a reminder, in the first half of the year, we had gross margin of about 65%. As we moved into Q3, our gross margin is 67.9%. As we got away from the cost of the previous years' inventory and how we worked that through our P&L, and this was exactly as we expected and it does give us greater confidence in our full-year guidance of cost of goods at approximately 33%.","And in terms of how that moves forward, while we're not giving specific guidance for 2018 at this point, we still are committed to the 200 basis point improvement in gross margin by 2020, and we do expect to see some of that come forward in 2018.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","Next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","(41:34-41:44).","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","We couldn't hear you. Are you still there? So, next question please.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse","Thanks. A follow-up on the gross margin trend in terms of species mix and profitability. What were sort of the major components driving that gross margin trend in the quarter? And curious why, I guess, it wasn't even higher given the disproportionate exposure to presumably a higher margin business, and I think you mentioned promotional activity around that, but how much was that a contributing factor and will that continue?","And then, the second part on the VFD. I guess, how do you expect to offset this, I guess near-term? As we head into 2018, do you anticipate incremental headwinds from the VFD in medicinal feed additives in the U.S. alone in 2018. And is this greater than what you've kind of experienced, I guess in 2017, and what have you sort of gleaned from (42:47) or can compare it to what has transpired in Europe in terms of those regulations? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Erin. Glenn, do you want to answer the gross margin question, please.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of gross margin for the quarter, Erin, and what are the components that drive it, and why it couldn't necessarily be even more favorable. There are number of factors in terms of gross margin. So, A, there is the product component that you referenced. But there is also the market mix component. And when you look at the quarter in particular, we saw stronger growth in our international market versus U.S. and as our international markets generally have lower gross margin than the U.S. in total that did impact the quarter.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And in terms of the VFD, we think that the impact has been mostly affecting 2017, and it's pretty much now the impact or the volume of products affected by these new directive been rebased. We expect that some minor impact in 2018, but not having a significant impact in our revenue growth. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks very much. Could you give us an update on generics on your business. So, both in terms of what brands are seeing the most erosion from generic pressures, and then, conversely how is your generic business doing? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, John. So, in terms of generic, we have not seen an acceleration of penetration in this year, so it's in line with our expectations. We continue supporting our products that are affected by generic competition with lifecycle innovation, and an example has been the introduction of the chewable formulation for Clavamox. Clavamox is doing very well, and we are delivering the results in line with our projections.","In the case of Rimadyl, it's a combination of not only generic, but the introduction of our new products. But still, what we have seen in terms of a generic penetration for Rimadyl it's in line with the trends that we already projected or already discussed in previous meetings. We still think that the impact over time, it's about 20% to 40% and will remain what we still project for this type of generic competition.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I'll ask two questions upfront. First one, Glenn, just to push you a little bit on the gross margin, is there any sort of (45:41) the cadence of gross margin? In other words, per your full year guidance, it looks like you should be exiting this year or 4Q 2017 at around 65% or even 69%. You do call out a lot of investment and manufacturing in the coming quarters, so just wondering if that weighs a bit in 2018. I know you said higher next year, but I just want to be as clear as possible, without be a little bit higher of the full year 2017 number?","And then just maybe, Juan Ram\u00f3n, the peak sales of $500 million plus for the derm portfolio, those numbers have been tremendous, but maybe a time line for this to be achieved? In other words, this quarter you can annualize it out to $0.5 billion-ish. I know you benefited from seasonality in the DTC, but is the thought that you can get to that sort of peak number within the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jon, and let me answer the dermatology portfolio projection, and then Glenn will cover the gross margin question. So, we think that these peak sales of more than $500 million. We expect to generate that in the next two or three years. So, it's not talking about peak sales on five years, no, in this case, two or three years and is what we expected to achieve this more than $500 million in sales for Apoquel and Cytopoint combined. Glenn?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So Jon, just to go a little deeper into the gross margin, so your question on Q4, I mean if you look at the year-to-date gross margin, we're sitting at approximately 66%. Our guidance would imply approximately 67%, right, which would imply a better Q4. Some of the drivers of that, as Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, we do expect the U.S. cattle to return to growth and some of the premium anti-infectives there as well generate a higher margin and that is one impact that will give us better margin as we look into Q4. In terms of 2018 and my comments there, that was referring to full year 2017 expectations on cost of goods and an improvement over that as we move in 2018.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take the next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. So, I have two questions please. The first is, with respect to your companion animal product launch ramps, could you provide some color on where those stand ex-U.S.? And basically where you are in ramping up new companion animal products ex-U.S.?","And then second, looking ahead to future innovation in R&D, will it continue to be more heavily weighted towards companion animal or should we think about the pace of livestock, new product launches accelerating? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you Dave. Glenn, will provide details of sales U.S. and ex-U.S., and then I will respond to your question on the R&D.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of the new companion animal products U.S. and ex-U.S. the ramp is definitely ahead of the curve, in terms of the U.S., just based on the timing of launches and the availability of the products. So, for example we just recently launched Cytopoint outside of the U.S. in Europe.","So, in terms of the breakout between \u2013 so for total derm, we had sales of $124 million with $89 million in the U.S. and $35 million international; for Simparica, we had sales of $25 million, $17 million of that is in the U.S. and $8 million is in international.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn. In terms of where we invest in R&D, I think we have a good distribution of investment between livestock and companion animal. We have been successful in new products in companion animal, but this is not an implication that in the future we'll not be bringing products in poultry, swine or cattle, and also now including fish.","One of the example, is that we expected to introduce a new poultry vaccines in the vector technology in the U.S. in 2018. And also, we expect to have new PCV vaccines for swine in the U.S. also in 2018. So, we continue investing in all the different areas of our portfolio, and we are not just targeting companion animal. On the contrary, we are trying really to diversify our investment and maintain the diversity in our portfolio.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Given the recent comments from a large competitor, if Elanco, Merial and Merck Animal Health all became independent companies, what would be the impact on Zoetis, and how would you size up each of these as a potential competitor? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","First, the decisions of other companies, definitely we cannot make any comment. But definitely having competitors that will be competing with us as a public companies, I don't see that as a negative. On the contrary, you will see that our financials are very good \u2013 are very good now, if we compare to other companies in animal health. And in my opinion, you will see that our margins are significantly higher than any other competitor. So, having this public information in my opinion will be only positive to us.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Esther Rajavelu - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. This is Esther Rajavelu on for Gregg Gilbert. Thank you for taking my question. On the companion portfolio, can you please discuss the trends you're seeing on the use of Cytopoint versus Apoquel? How are vets choosing between the two, and any pet owner feedback you may have on one product versus the other?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, we provide information about the two products to the veterinarians, it's up to them to decide, which one is meeting best the needs of their patients; Apoquel it's oral, Cytopoint, it's injectable. In some cases, while injectable is a preferred option for treating these type of medical condition. In the case of Cytopoint\/Apoquel decisions, I think it's up to veterinarians, and in some cases that they are even combining the two products, depending on why they feel it's the best for their patients.","And in terms of Cytopoint, the feedback has been extremely positive. So, we know that with Apoquel, it's now very well established in the market. Cytopoint, it was more recent, but I think feedback that we are getting from veterinarians is extremely positive; in terms of efficacy, but also in terms of side effects. So in both cases, excellent feedback from the market.","Next question, please.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n for any closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you very much for joining us.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to John O'Connor. John, you may begin.","John O'Connor","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site. Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our press release and the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 11, 2015. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, John. Good morning to everyone. In my remarks today, I will discuss our 2014 performance, provide an update on the Zoetis revenue growth versus industry growth, review recent sponsor from the full portfolio and then with our outlook for 2015. 2014 was a year when we made significant progress in creating value. We are growing revenue faster than the market. We improved our margins despite absorbing additional costs required to operate as a fully independent company. We continue to advance our product portfolio through internal R&D initiatives. We communicated a 15% increase in our dividend and $500 million share repurchase program.","This week, we announced that we completed the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health. We also continue to build a culture that delivers results, creates a high sense of ownership from our colleagues and focuses on generating short and long-term value for customers and shareholders. For the year, we delivered operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11%. Both revenue and adjusted diluted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance. Here are some details of 2014 revenue by species on an operational basis. In livestock, total revenue grew 9% to $3.1 billion. This reflects favorable market conditions for our producers and a strong performance of key Zoetis brands across affective vaccines and medicated feed additives.","Livestock markets benefited from strong meat and milk prices as well as less expensive animal feed. These generated strong producer profits and in these market producers increased the medical treatment of animals to preserve their value. This has benefited many premium Zoetis brands.","Cattle grew in revenues by 10% to $1.7 billion, with exceptional growth coming from beef cattle markets like the U.S., Brazil and Canada, as well as from our China business. In some key markets we see signs that the process of cattle expansion has begun. In the near-term, the high value of animals will continue to support our growth as producers have placed their premium on the health of their herds. Swine revenue grew 9% to $695 million with strong growth in many countries around the world. New and recent protein production such as ENGAIN, DRAXXIN 25, Relan N and our PCV2 franchise continue to grow in the market that experienced challenges due to disease outbreaks and trade restrictions. Poultry revenue grew 6% to $568 million with the strong growth coming from the U.S. and Latin America. Our growth portfolio in poultry, integrated coccidiosis management programs, namely ropic brought value to producers and led to increased customer penetration in key markets. ","Turning to companion animal, revenue grew 4% to $1.6 billion. Across all regions we saw strong growth of key brands, including APOQUEL, ProHeart 6, CONVENIA, CERENIA and feline REVOLUTION. These gains were partially offset by declines in the vaccines and RIMADYL due to increased competition. For 2014, APOQUEL achieved sales of 34 million in an environment of constrained supply. For 2015, we are on track to increase supply in [etrin] and we expect APOQUEL revenues to be between $150 million and $175 million this year.","Building on several years of solid revenue performance, we continue to deliver stronger revenue growth in 2014. We are also pleased that Zoetis continues to outpace the animal health industry. According to the latest data, for the 12 months ending Q3 2014, Zoetis revenue grew 5.5% while the animal health market grew by 4.6%. This growth includes the negative impact of currency movements. The steady interaction of our new products and investment in life cycle management contributed to steady revenue growth. In 2014, Zoetis achieved more than 180 product approvals, representing new products, new indications, new formulations, new combinations and geographic expansion of our portfolio.","We recorded several important product milestones in recent months. This past November Zoetis submitted to the FDA a filing for zoromandis, which is the active ingredient of our new flea and tick oral parasiticide for dogs. And last month, we completed the filing for the same product in the EU and Canada. The global market for flea and tick parasiticides is about $2.5 billion to $3.4 billion. And launching a new product in this category is an opportunity with broad bacteria potential for Zoetis. Although bacteria for the animal health industry is generally prone to generating more than $100 million a year.","Now let me turn to another milestone that illustrates continued integration from our R&D investment. We are pleased to announce that Zoetis has submitted a filing to the USDA for a novel antibody therapy to treat atopic dermatitis in dogs. Based on the USDA guidance, we are expecting a conditional license this year. Our progress in this therapeutic area further reinforces our industry leadership innovation. We have been active in building a platform in monoclonal antibodies that will have a broad application across species and medical conditions. The first potential product from this platform builds on our knowledge base in the area of canine dermatology. We are excited to bring another treatment option to veterinarians. In addition to novel products, Zoetis continues to drive demand and strengthen its diverse product portfolio through investments in product life cycle development. This past November, the FDA got a new label claim for DRAXXIN 25 in the U.S. to treat smaller cats. This follows the approval of DRAXXIN 25 label claims for pigs in July 2015. We also achieved additional label claims for the FOSTERA PRRS and vaccine for swine which is now licensed in the U.S. for reproductive protection. This product was first approved for respiratory protection in 2012.","Zoetis PEDv vaccine continued to expand geographically, receiving permission to import and sell in Canada. Zoetis also launched the vaccine in China which broadens our range of vaccines in the world's largest swine market. As I mentioned, we just closed the purchase of Abbott Animal Health. This business is focused on the veterinary surgical market. It will strengthen our pain and sedation product portfolio and expand our diagnostic business. This acquisition is aligned with our value creation strategy to enhance our portfolio. We are adding leading brands and we believe Zoetis is gaining industry leading field force. I know at present we\u2019ll expand both the reach and penetration of the new portfolio.","Zoetis also invests in animal health innovation through research partnerships. We recently announced that Zoetis was chosen to lead a research team to develop digital technologies for improved swine health and production efficiencies. Paul will address our 2015 guidance later in the call, but I would like to give you our perspective on the animal health industry on some factors that will drive Zoetis in 2015. The animal health industry is forecasted to grow in the 5% to 6% range operationally over the next five years, with growth in any given year above or below these rates.","Looking to 2015, we expect operational revenue growth for Zoetis to keep pace with or outpace the animal health market. We also expect adjusted net income to grow faster than revenue as we leverage our business model and continue to focus on improving cost efficiencies. Now, our perspective by species; the outlook for companion animal is positive. Increased pet ownership and higher pet expense rates are driving the growth in emerging markets while specialty care is contributing to growth in more developed markets. For Zoetis, we must expect that the sales of APOQUEL will have a positive impact on growth in this segment.","The outlook for livestock in 2015 is also positive. Producers will remain very profitable although at lower levels than in 2014. For Zoetis our premium products will remain an important factor to protect the health and value of livestock animals. And the line the ban for animal health products that remain strong, despite economic events such as lower growth in GDP, significant movements in the exchange rate, lower oil prices or international trade developments. We are monitoring the current business environment and all the exchange rates we don't see any significant impact on our business from these factors. As the past has shown again we'll have industry resilient to these and other microeconomic factors. Within the industry, Zoetis is highly diversify across many dimensions and this diversity has allow us to successfully manage through many market conditions in the past.","The drivers of growth in animal health remain unchanged. Animal proteins and companionship from pets are basic needs, so we are confident about the future prospects and our ability to grow under volatile market conditions.","So, I will now turn it over to Paul to talk about results for the fourth quarter, the year and guidance for 2015.","Paul Herendeen","Thank you, Juan Ramon, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I am going to review our performance compared with our full year 2014 guidance, provide some color on the fourth quarter results and update you on our full year guidance for 2015. I hope to do all that quickly so that we have plenty of time for Q&A, so here we go.","Starting with full year 2014 results, the big stories here are revenue, revenue growth and revenue growth from a variety of sources. In 2014, we delivered 7% operational growth in revenue, the second consecutive year of 7% operational growth and second consecutive year of growth above the long-term industry trend. Pretty good, right? Even better, in the fourth quarter we delivered 9% operational growth versus Q4 of 2013, overcoming some significant FX headwinds to post 5% reported growth with positive operational trends that are heading right into 2015. Changes in FX rates reduced our Q4 reported growth rate, but we were able to overcome that and still put a solid growth number on the board. Good stuff indeed. Since mid-November FX rates have continued to move against us. I will help you think about the impact of FX rates on 2015 in a minute.","Now for a look at our full-year performance versus guidance. As you can see on the Web cast slides, our revenue of 4.8 billion exceeded the high end of our expectations. The operating growth of 7% was driven by 9% growth in livestock and 4% in companion animal. On a regional basis, the U.S. accounted for almost half of our growth, up 8% compared with 2013. CLAR accounted for about third of our operational growth, up 13%. APAC was about 11% of our operational growth, up 5%, and EuAfME accounted for about 8% of our operational growth, it was up 2% versus 2013. But in going to belt, and all growth rates are on an operational basis. ","Continuing with 2014 performance compared with our guidance, our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was 35.1%, a bit better than our guidance of 35.5%, and that's primarily due to the positive impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Adjusted SG&A meanwhile, was 1.507 billion for the full year, approximately 27 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. There were a number of factors that contributed to the increase in SG&A above expectations.","First, as we trended above our revenue forecast for the latter part of the quarter, we saw an increase in costs associated with higher revenue, such as sales incentive compensation and distribution expenses. We also authorized additional promotional spending in the quarter, spending that is expected to support revenue growth into 2015. Next, we accelerated some actions in Q4 that triggered additional G&A expense in the quarter, including for example, severance, software license expense and some additional business development expenses. ","As successful as we have been in driving our top line, we are still a young Company, just finishing up our second year on our own. We have plenty of work remaining to build and fine-tune our G&A organizations and the systems needed to support our global business model. As that process continues, there will be opportunities to move forward and towards a more efficient cost structure. In other items, adjusted R&D expense came in at 393 million, in line with our full-year guidance. This continues to be an essential investment for both developing new products and managing the life cycle of the more than 300 product lines that provide us with our durable and growing revenue streams. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was almost 27%, and 18% in the fourth quarter. This reflected the full-year impact of the R&D tax credit which, you will recall, was not anticipated in our guidance. Also contributing to the lower-than-expected tax rate was a resolution of prior tax matters and changes in the mix of our earnings.","It's important to know that the elements that drove the rate down below our and your expectations were not structural and we continue to expect that our tax rate in 2015 will be approximately 29%. As with our 2014 guidance, our tax rate guidance for 2015 does not include the potential benefit of an extension of the R&D tax credit. We exceeded the top end of our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS by $0.03 a share, posting $1.57 per share for the full-year. This was due to the strong revenues and the lower-than-expected tax rate, offset in part by increased spending in the fourth quarter ","And finally, we exceeded our range on certain significant items and acquisition-related costs for 2014. This was the result of costs associated with certain shareholder activities and some changes associated with our global manufacturing organization. As a result, our reported diluted EPS came in at $1.16, the lower end of our guidance range.","Now let me switch gears and dive a bit more into the fourth quarter results. You can see our income statement and adjusted income statement slides on our Web cast. Repeating from my opening remarks, fourth quarter revenue grew 9% operationally and 5% on a reported basis. And while nine minus five equals four, there is some rounding in there so the negative impact of currency movements on our growth rate was roughly 330 basis points. Our U.S. and CLAR segments demonstrated strong double-digit sales growth, leading the way for Zoetis , while the APAC segment grew modestly and EuAfME declined 1% on an operational basis. ","On the last call I talked about the hazards of reading too much into any one quarter in isolation. EuAfME illustrates that clearly. In Q1 revenue was down 4% operationally and in Q2 revenue was up 4% operationally. In Q3 was up 12% operationally in Q4 it declined 1%. But for the year, operational growth for EuAfME was about 2%, broadly in line with the long-term expected growth rate for that segment. Moving to SG&A. Our adjusted SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter were up 14% operationally due to the timing of promotional spending and other items that I called out earlier in my discussion of the full-year. Our adjusted R&D expense was up 4% operationally in the quarter. R&D, as I had noted before, can vary quarter to quarter due to the timing of clinical trials and other factors. For the full year we performed in line with our guidance. ","And finally as I mentioned earlier, our catch rate in the quarter was 18%, due to a number of factors that got worked out in the fourth quarter. You also have a full set of regional tables and quarterly commentaries in the press release and Web cast slides. With that material available to you, let me just highlight a few takeaways on the revenue and profitability for each segment.","Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue increased 14% driven by very strong livestock sales, which were up 19%, a truly stellar quarter for the largest segment of our business. The growth in livestock products, especially cattle in United States was based on higher demand for our premium products as producers continue to benefit from strong market conditions, some of which Juan Ramon just touched on.","In companion animal products in the U.S., we generated growth of 7% driven by APOQUEL and other key brands, and despite continued competition for RIMADYL and competitive pressure in vaccines and parasiticides. Based on the U.S. segment strong sales and lower relative expense growth, their segment earnings increased by 20%. In Europe, Africa and Middle East, revenue decreased 1% on an operational basis compared with the fourth quarter 2013. This was the result of revenue increases in Southern Europe and Germany, driven by livestock as well as APOQUEL sales in the UK and Germany, with those increases more than offset by declines in other markets such as France and Russia. In France, we had anticipated some softness in the fourth quarter based on the fact that customers bought large amounts of anti-infectives in the third quarter ahead of more restrictive legislative changes that went into effect January 1st. The EuAfME segment earnings decreased by 4% operationally in the quarter, primarily due to declines in revenue and the timing of promotional spending.","Moving to CLAR, which is our Canada and Latin American segment, we generated an increase of 16% operationally compared with the fourth quarter 2013. Brazil and Canada are the principal drivers in the","CLAR region, given their relative size, and we saw growth in both livestock and companion animal products in these two countries. In Canada we saw significant cattle product sales due to strong market conditions for producers. Increased medicalization rates for companion animals in Brazil have been a driver of growth there as well. We also saw strong growth in Venezuela and other emerging markets in Central and South America. These high inflationary markets afford attractive growth opportunities that need to be carefully monitored. The CLAR segment earnings increased 20% on an operational basis, driven by the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses.","Finally, in Asia Pacific we had an increase of 4% operationally compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales of livestock products did well, particularly in Australia, Southeast Asia and across the board in emerging markets. A growing vaccine portfolio for swine and new parasiticide products continued to drive our performance there. Sales of companion animal products, however, declined 6% operationally, primarily due to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan that we talked about last quarter. The APAC segment operating earnings increased 6% operationally due to the revenue growth and limited growth in operating expenses.","Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2015, which we first provided at our Investor Day in mid-November. We\u2019re updating certain elements of our full year guidance today to reflect three things. First, a factor over which we have no control and that\u2019s FX rates. We're adjusting our guidance based on the changes in foreign currency exchange rates from mid-November when we first reported our guidance for 2015 to reflect rates as of late January. In those roughly 70 days the U.S. dollar strengthened against almost all of the major currencies in which we transact. For emphasis and in round numbers, the dollar was up 9% versus the euro, 8% versus the Canadian dollar, 8% versus the Aussie dollar, 4% versus the British pound, 1% against the Japanese yen and against the Brazilian real it was flat. Those are our top six currencies.","The movement in exchange rates since mid-November reduced our revenue expectations for full year 2015 by 125 million or 255 basis points, based on the midpoint of our initial guidance range. We now expect the full year impact of FX to be about 600 basis points or almost 300 million on our full year 2015 revenue as compared with our 2014 actual results. I want to repeat that for emphasis. Since mid-November the change in FX rate reduced our expectations for the full year 2015 by 255 basis points or 125 million, comparing our revised expectations for 2015 back to 2014 actual results, the changes in FX rates account for a 600 basis point reduction in our expected growth rate.","So natural hedging from expenses denominated in foreign currencies reduces the dollar impact of the movements in FX at adjusted net income, where the negative impact of the change rate was roughly $30 million or roughly 360 basis points down from the midpoint of our initial guidance range. Something for you to be aware of, if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against our major currencies, that can put upward pressure on our effective tax rate. At this point, we are affirming our guidance for our tax rate at approximately 29%, not including the R&D tax credit. But for emphasis, I am going to repeat something I just said, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar could cause us to have to revisit that guidance. So that's another part we can monitor but don't control.","The part we can control are our operating expenses in 2015. In addition to the expense reductions driven by the change in FX rates, we revised downward our range of expectations for SG&A expenses by an additional $35 million. This reflects targeted reductions in spending intended to help offset the FX impact on 2015 adjusted net income. Additionally we completed the acquisition of the assets of Abbott Animal Health this week. With that done now, we will begin integration and expect a positive impact of approximately 75 million to revenue for our full-year 2015 results, an accretion of $0.01 per share to adjusted diluted EPS for the full-year 2015.","Taking the FX rate changes and our reduction of expected SG&A into account as well as the Abbott transaction, our revised guidance calls for revenue in the range of 4.8 billion to 4.9 billion and results in our holding our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. The net $50 million reduction in the revenue range represents a roughly 125 million, or 2.5%, decrease driven by the change in the FX rates. ","Meanwhile, the combination of the natural FX hedges inherent in our business and our targeted $35 million of OpEx reductions and the overall impact of Abbott, all those things combined enabled us to maintain our earlier adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2015. While we provided out guidance in November, we expressed growth targets based on the midpoints of our 2014 guidance ranges. With 2014 now final, it won't be freshening the growth rates implied by our guidance. ","The more significant revenue base that we delivered in 2014 and our guidance as revised today to include Abbott and the expected expense reductions, we are expecting revenue growth on an operational basis in the range of 6.5% to 8.5% and growth of adjusted net income in the range of 11% to 16%. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release. Please note that our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. While we do not guide on a quarterly basis, I will remind you of a comment I made at our Investor Day in November about the trajectory of our overall performance in 2015. ","We still expect the year to start low and end high. A key driver of our growth in 2015 will be the additional supply of APOQUEL, but we will not see that supply increase until Q2. I also want to note that the revenue impact of the Abbott acquisition in Q1 is nominal, less than $5 million. And that there will be a negative impact on reported Q1 results based on the changes in FX rates since my comments in November.","To sum up the quarter and the year, we continue with very strong revenue and earnings growth, demonstrating the strength of our global business model. The diversity of our business across species, product lines, geographies and therapeutic areas is one of our core strengths. Our global footprint enables us to overcome weaknesses in some regions and deliver consistent revenue and earnings growth. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional statements, while continue to absorb some of the impact and buildup of costs for our corporate functions. Foreign currency was a significant factor on our reported results in the quarter and for the year, and we have updated our full-year 2015 guidance based on the rates in effect as of late January 2015.","We expect to deliver strong revenue and profit growth on an operational basis in 2015, 6.5% to 8.5% for revenue and 11% to 16% for adjusted net income. While the currency headwinds are expected to be a drag on our reported results and growth rates, we have taken steps to mitigate some of those impacts and will continue to pursue means of protecting and growing our adjusted net income throughout the year. ","That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question is coming from Louise Chen, with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. ","Louise Chen","My question here is since it's hard to find good companies to comp Zoetis's operating margin to, could you provide us a framework for thinking about where Zoetis's operating margin could improve to over the longer-term, beyond the 30% that you had forecasted at Investor Day?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Louise, for the question. So we are convinced that now that we are finishing our work in standing up Zoetis on implementing new systems that will support our future operations, we can really identify opportunities for being more efficient in many lines of our P&L. That is something that we will continue in define business opportunities and seeing ways of improving our margins in the medium and long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei, with BMO Capital. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei","Good morning and congratulations on a strong quarter. Juan Ramon, you mentioned strong market conditions and profitability in the livestock market. Clearly a key driver here, can you clarify on your outlook, when you say you expect this to continue in the near-term, what is the timeframe you put on that one-year or two-year? I want to get a sense of how long you think the cycle will last? And Paul, a follow-up if I may, you got a significant FX benefit on cost of goods sold this quarter. You lowered revenue guidance because of FX. I am just wondering why not raise gross margin guidance to reflect an FX benefit? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Alex. In my comment I refer to the outlook was in for this year. So, we mentioned that in 2014, the conditions in livestock were very positive; the price of milk and meat was very high. Also there were low costs on feeding the animals. We expect that most of these conditions will remain in 2015, although we see maybe in some of the species like swine, maybe a lot of more attention in terms of price because of more supply of product. Since some of the rates that were affecting 2014, maybe we\u2019ll have a lower impact in \u201815 like the PEDv outbreak. So, we expect that the conditions will remain favorable, although for some of the species, maybe less profitable than in 2014.","Paul Herendeen","Thanks for the question, Alex. I'll take the question regarding the FX benefit that flowed through cost of goods sold. I want to point out that the timing of the way FX flows through our cost of goods sold is somewhat difficult to predict and also when you recognize it as we did in 2014 that does not necessarily translate into a continued benefit flowing through in 2015, point of fact that could very easily turn around on us on a reported basis.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. My apologies, we actually have Mark Schoenebaum. Line is now open with Evercore ISI.","Mark Schoenebaum","Also my congratulations to Paul on a great job since you've taken the reins as CFO and to John on the IR front. Just a question on, I'm intrigued by your comments around your antibody platform. I haven't heard you talk about that before. You gave a little bit of detail during your prepared remarks, but I'd be interested in knowing more if possible, like how broad this program really is. Are you pursuing antibodies outside of companion animal dermatology or should we think of this is mainly a derm program? And the impact, if any that you think this antibody program will have on your P&L once commercial. Gross margins on the human health side tend to be a bit lower on antibodies than they are for small molecules. And then also of course on a CapEx -- long-term CapEx projection, sometimes building plants capable of producing large quantities of biologics can be expensive. I am wondering if that's already something that you've got your footprint or if these products are going to be big, we should be altering our models to some degree? Thanks a lot.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Mark. The monoclonal antibody that we mentioned today, it's a product that we neutralized the canine interleukin, which is also a key cytokine which is involved in the atopic dermatitis and also involved in sending the signs of itching to the brain of the animals. We have been investing in biopharmaceuticals for now several years. And we have been also introducing the products in these categories, not only on antibodies but on biopharmaceuticals. A good example is Improvac that was launched some years ago. And we also focus our attention to platforms that we also increase, the product portfolio that also will meet the demands of the market. We are very pleased that Zoetis is not only leading in pharmaceuticals, we have many examples like APOQUEL, that we've shown very strong leadership in that category, but also in vaccines.","In 2014, we had the opportunity also to bring to the market a solution for an outbreak that it was a highly significant impact in the swine industry in the U.S., I am referring to the PEDv vaccine. And now we have used monoclonal antibody, we\u2019re also showing that also we are leading in biopharmaceuticals. We're very pleased also that our model, which is combining investment in innovation with investment in the protecting of our current portfolio is showing a high level of productivity and leading the industry in all different areas of innovation.","Paul Herendeen","Mark, it's Paul. First, thank you for the kind words. Yes, I had the very good fortune to join an outstanding team here. So, while I\u2019ll take the complement, I'd also say that it's a team game here. I also want to pile on a little bit on the R&D front, because from an investor perspective I kind of think of Zoetis is kind of like two-in-one. You have a large growing portfolio of existing business and we also have this robust R&D engine, that if it were on its own, would represent an attractive investment opportunity in its own right. So great question, thank you.","Operator","We will now take a question from Kevin Ellich, with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Ellich","Given your strong operational growth, I was just wondering if you'd break out the difference between volume and what type of pricing increases you are pushing through. And then could you maybe talk about the performance of some of your new products like ACTOGAIN and ENGAIN, and if you'd noticed any significant market share. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Paul will answer the first part of the question and then I will make some comments about the new product launches. ","Paul Herendeen","I will speak to the history because that's what we can do with respect to price and volume. Let's start with the quarter. We had total growth, as I said, operational growth 9%. Of that 9%, roughly 2% came from price and 7% came from volume. So strong in the quarter. Take that for the full-year, 7% operational growth. Again, 2% came from price and roughly 5% from volume. We got a lot more pricing leverage in emerging markets than in developed markets. I don't know if it's all that productive to go through the specifics of it, but I hope that, in general, answers your question. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Then back to your question on ACTOGAIN or ENGAIN. Both products performance are doing well and exceeding our initial projections. One of the factors that has been also impacting the higher revenue than expected, it was withdrawn off of one competitor product one year ago. So very pleased, with also the acceptance of our two products from customers, and these two products, ENGAIN is for the swine producers and ACTOGAIN for cattle producers. Both performing above expectations. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wilson, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Erin Wilson","I was reading some of the literature on APOQUEL on the Web site and it continues to say that April's launch time frame or replenish supply. Will this be the same? Will it be fully ramped up that point? Or will there still be order limits in place over the course of the year? Is this all Incorporated into your guidance at this point? And then on new products, could you speak to the opportunity in diagnostics, any attraction you're seeing with your feline rapid assay? Is that an area you expect to build as to acquisitions? Do you anticipate any product launches in diagnostics overall? ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Erin. On APOQUEL, definitely we expect that from April we'll increase significantly the production of the product, or the product availability to the veterinary market. We expect that from April we will be able to meet all the demands from the customers. And we expect also that through the year, demand will increase and then we will be able to supply all these demands with the product that will be available. As I said in my remarks, we are forecasting for 2015 revenues from $150 million to $175 million. And we are convinced that this will be a significant quality in our portfolio, and we are very pleased that all the constraints that we face in 2014 will be over in 2015 from April. ","In terms of diagnostics, the diagnostics has been always -- since some years ago an area and where we have been also investing. We are convinced that this very complementary to our current portfolio and we also expect that with our internal efforts and also the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health, this will enhance our portfolio and definitely we will also consider any external opportunity and even further expressing our portfolio diagnostics. ","Paul Herendeen","It is Paul just a follow-up a little bit area. So the modelers out there and I know there are plenty, with respect to APOQUEL, we get through the first quarter and when we have supply we would expect a stair step for sales of APOQUEL and then with growth to follow. So I hope that provides a little better color.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger, with William Blair.","John Kreger","Juan Ramon you mentioned the new oral flea and tick product that has been filed. Do think that will be in a position to be fully launched by spring 2016 season? And then a quick second question I believe on Investor Day you talked about efforts to optimize your manufacturing. Program, which I know is big and complex around the world. Can you just give us an update on the timing for that broader effort? ","Juan Ramon Alaix","We expect [indiscernible] to be available sometime in 2016, which will depend on the approval from the FDA as well as the approval from EMA in Europe. And also in Canada also we expect approval. And we are working to make sure that the product will be available for the next parasitic campaign in April or around spring next year. Something that it will depend on FDA, but we expect to provide to FDA all the information needed to get this product approved on time. In terms of manufacturing, we mentioned during our Investor Day that from now until 2020, we expect an improvement in our cost by 200 basis points. And plans are moving ahead. And there is no any reason to think that we\u2019ll not be delivering on the objective that we have. Now also we mentioned that we have three phases of our plan. We are now on Phase 1, in this Phase 1, we\u2019ll be delivering these 200 basis points, then we\u2019ll go into the next phase that we\u2019ll be going to further analyze our plan network and then finally the third phase will be how we need to invest in manufacturing to achieve higher profitability or lower cost and also making sure that we have the technologies that will be needed to support our future revenues. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Chris Schott","Just to two quick ones here. First following up an earlier pricing question, can you just elaborate a little more on the drivers of pricing particularly on the production side of the business? I guess specifically is there more opportunity to selectively raise or reset price when you see healthy market dynamics that we\u2019re seeing for your customers in the current environment? And second with just a broader business development kind of question, in area I think we all have a little bit less visibility into, but when you look at these Abbott type transaction that seem to make a lot of sense for Zoetis. How broad is an opportunity effect do you see on the business development front and given some of the anti-trust issues in the space are there realistically larger targets that Zoetis could pursue or should we really think of Abbott type transactions being the real focus here? Thanks very much.","Juan Ramon Alaix","In terms of pricing, the approach that we have for both like livestock and companionable is to have steady and consistent price increases. We are not trying to get the opportunity of higher prices when the conditions are more favorable to livestock producers. And at the same time, we also apply pricing increases with these conditions as less favorable. So is -- and study that has been working very well and a study that has been extended to many markets around the world including emerging markets. And we had in 2014 very positive improvement in our prices in many of these emerging markets. In terms of really definitely Abbott was a great opportunity that it was meeting all the requirements that we have in terms of business development opportunities including the strategic field, including the synergies, revenues and cost, also the financial value and the anti-trust issues.","Definitely we have significant market-share, you know that we have market-share which is close to 20% and these may have some intentions in terms of a larger acquisition. We\u2019ll consider any opportunity that is available in the market. We have a team that is aware of any kind of potential transaction that can be an opportunity for Zoetis and we will continue assessing these opportunities and as part of the evolution, we include any kind of anti-trust challenge, but we\u2019ll limit the value of the acquisition. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jamie Rubin","Sorry about that, can you hear me? Sorry about that guys. Had a little technical difficulty on my end. Juan Ramon, can you tell you what do you think is on the agenda as a new Board member? Is the agenda more related to margin improvement or is it business development? And as a follow-up, can you remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it would impact a potential sale of the company, is Zoetis too large for an acquisition by a competitor or would it have to be acquired by company with essentially no animal health presence? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Jamie and let me start saying that we have very constructive dialogue with Pershing Square, since they became the largest shareholder in the fall. And they were -- they expressed interest in having a position in our board. And given that the Mr. Doyle has a lot of operational experience and again the position of Pershing Square in our company the Board agreed to incorporate him into our Board. So, what we -- all the Board will be working including Mr. Doyle and other members of the Board, increasing the value to our shareholders. And this value can come from many different ways. Including margins, growing revenues and any kind of potential transaction. And this is something that will be part of the discussions and maybe at this point may be stipulated is not creating any additional value to the discussion. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We can take our next question from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jeff Holford","Hi thanks very much for take my question. Going back to APOQUEL. Your 2015 guidance and commentary does suggest much higher peak sales and you get to full penetration to this so one could think of this product potentially adding 5% to 10% against your current base of revenues over the next couple of years. And I'm interested also around the level of margin seem a much higher margin product than the rest of the business overall. Could the potential bottom line impact from this product be a most double what it is that the top line? ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Jeff. On APOQUEL we mentioned our peak sales are predicted between 200 million of 300 million and these based on the current knowledge of the market. Definitely we will be updating these peak sales based on what will be the reaction and the consumption of the public once the product it is available. In over quantity to assess what is the full potential of this compound. In general, we are not providing gross margin by products, but as you know we have gross margin in our Company of 65% and we rank margins depending on the categories. The highest margins are coming from companion animal followed by cattle, swine, and poultry. So you can imagine that companion animal much higher than the 65% average that we have at the Zoetis . Paul do you want to add any other comments?","Paul Herendeen","Sure, just one that is the increased sales of APOQUEL certainly help. Of course we do have a mix of our portfolio for example the guidance table you all saw the addition of the Abbott assets to our total 2015 expectations. The Abbott assets are gross profit dilutive. Now I know they are only updated guidance for 75 million of sales but we do have a portfolio so even when things like APOQUEL help, there are other parts of our portfolio that can help smooth or help \u2013 they tend to smooth that out back towards our expected 35.5% to 36% -ish range of revenues in for 2015. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham","I am just looking back to cost efficiencies you mentioned this a couple of times during the call.","Can you go into little but more detail about the opportunities that you see here in which cost categories and over what time frame? ","Paul Herendeen","It is Paul. I will take a stab at that and Juan Ramon may want to come in as well. Louise asked a question earlier on about margin expansion and I just want to point out that so far, we've done a pretty good job over the course of the last several years if you have looked at our reported operating margins going back to 2011 and up to \u201914 and it's been a nice progression from \u201918 to \u201921 to \u201924 to \u201925 and I was broadly by rolling the top line while having some expense discipline meaning holding the line on expenses. Now a wise man once said to me it\u2019s not all that impressive to grow into an expanding margin but I would say it may not be impressive but it is a good thing. That said, that what sets the stage. Even with respect to think about our 2015 we saw some headwinds in FX and we took some actions with respect to our operating expenses in order to be able to as best we could without impacting our business model reduce our expected operating expenses for 2015. The areas where we are most likely to have long-term opportunity are those areas that are away from revenue production and R&D and manufacturing. ","And manufacturing would be more efficient to that process as we would hope to disclose to the market at some point in the future. In the area really is around those into recall enabling functions in G&A, we are still in the process of our standup. I know that is frustrating to a lot of people where we just really completed our second year on our own. We continue to have challenges in implementing systems and building out the infrastructure that will enable us to grow and control and manage what is a very complicated global business. As we make progress along the lines of the implementation for example of our global ERP package SAP, it will give us opportunity to be more efficient in our enabling functions. Now, we look at all types of expenses and I would say -- I do say constantly in investor meetings, we can always do better. So, we want to look at ways that we can deploy our capital within our business to the areas where we think we\u2019ll get the most bang for our buck, and to the extent that we are successful in doing that over the next several years, we expect that we can expand our operating margin potentially beyond what you would be -- or what would be implied by our current long-term guidance. And to refresh for everybody what we said on Investor Day was, you look out to 2015, '16, and '17 based on what you have in front of you, is you have a company that can grow from now roughly 25% operating margin and add 500 basis point so that by growing revenues and being disciplined with respect to expense. We see opportunities to be more efficient, that would survey be additive to that. Next question please.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we can take our next question from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Kathy Miner","Just two quick follow-ups if I may. First on the stand up cost and ERP spending that you were just discussing. I believe the last time you had talked about those costs winding down the early part of 2016 can you give us an update on the timing? And second one on the oral flea and tick products, when it does come out, should we expected to be differentiated in any key ways from the products that are already out there? Thank you.","Paul Herendeen","The timing on that was that we would expect to be fully up on SAP by the end of the first quarter of 2016. So 2015 is a busy year for us in that regard and we\u2019ll still have some work in the early part of 2016, but we would expect to put that behind us in early 2016.","Juan Ramon Alaix","And about Sarolaner that is our compound, the active ingredient of our new oral parasiticides for ticks and fleas, we are still working on the label. The label is not yet finalized and not approved. And we\u2019ll see how this is hit it's from competitors. And we know that there are already several competitors in the market, but as I said in my comments, it's a market of 2.5 billion to 3 billion. So it's a plenty of opportunities for Zoetis even in phase of several competitors. The other important point is that we have the access to the customers. We have a significant presence in all the markets, but the product will be available and the opportunity will be significant. And we are convinced that the vision of the model that we have which is our direct interaction with customers also will generate good revenues out of this product even with more or less differentiation in the market. Next question please.","Operator","We\u2019ll now take a follow-up from Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jamie Rubin","Hi, you may have missed my second part of my question if you could remind us of the agreement with Pfizer and how it impacted potential sales to the company? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Yes, thank you, Jamie. While this agreement it's an agreement that its part of the tax matter agreement for which there are some restrictions until June 24. After this time there will be no restrictions but even with these potential restrictions until that date, there also maybe opportunities for company's considering transactions which are not affected by this tax matter agreement. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Reisinger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","David Reisinger","Thanks very much and congratulations to the team on the strong quarter. My question is on SG&A and I guess there are a few sub parts to it and it really relates to the cross currents. So, in the fourth quarter SG&A was above expectations, yet for 2015 SG&A will be below expectations. So with respect to the fourth quarter, were there any one-time or unusual items in the non-GAAP SG&A, Paul that will not repeat in the fourth quarter of 2015? And then second on the 2015 SG&A outlook coming down $35 million, does that include any sales force rationalization and if not, what are the areas of cuts?","Paul Herendeen","Yes sure, I\u2019ll start with the SG&A in Q4, David. There were as I articulated in my prepared remarks there are some of those cost that were directly related to increase revenue. There were some dates when we get to a certain point in revenue, where we have released additional promotional spending that occurred in Q4 that might not be likely to complete unless we are trending well above our expectations again in Q4 of 2015. So I wouldn\u2019t describe the items in there so much as one time. This is the ones that are within our adjusted SG&A. They were expenses that in large part were managed by us in the quarter, and reflect a robust revenue quarter for us and looking ahead to 2015. Thinking about the SG&A for 2015, full-year, we did reduce the range by some $35 million and no, it does not reflect any sort of a restructuring or anything. Evidence of that is if it had been a restructuring we probably would have called out in one-time cost and certain significant items restructuring charge. This was -- what I will call a normal course of business, looking at 2015, looking at where we are relative to where we want to be in us taking actions around categories that we do not think will influence that top line. So by definition, away from revenue generation mainly in enabling type functions. I hope that answers the question. Next question please.","Operator","There are no further questions. At this time I would like to turn the program back over to Mr. Juan Ramon for any additional or closing remarks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you for joining us today. On our fourth quarter results total year for 2014. And our guidance for this year. So thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference.

Steve, you may begin.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements, today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, November 1, 2018. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2018, we have been making significant effort to support future growth with investment in the business. We are allocating more resources to critical R&D projects, updating and expanding many of our manufacturing capabilities and investing in key areas such as diagnostics with the recent acquisition of Abaxis. We are making good progress integrating Abaxis. Our sales teams have been cross-trained on Zoetis' and Abaxis' product lines in the U.S. and Canada, and they're already collaborating on customer accounts. Outside of the U.S. we are focused on building a more robust diagnostic team and using the existing Zoetis infrastructure to expand our diagnostics sales.","The initial feedback on the acquisition has been very good. Our field force has been very positive about the potential of this combination and the more comprehensive solutions they can now bring to our veterinary customers. Early customer response has been very encouraging. Our core business and investment strategy has Zoetis well-positioned for the future with a diverse portfolio addressing needs across the continuum of care and a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations.","As I mentioned last quarter, we have taken a phased filing approach for a new three-way combination parasiticide, and we continue making that progress. The product will be known by the trade name Simparica Trio, and it will combine sarolaner and two other active ingredients to focus on ectoparasites such as fleas, ticks and mites as well as internal parasites and the prevention of heartworm disease.","Our phased regulatory filings are progressing in the U.S. The safety, efficacy and chemistry manufacturing and control technical sections are under FDA review. In addition, we have submitted the dossier with the European Medicines Agency and subject to regulatory reviews and approval, we would anticipate Simparica Trio coming to market in 2020. We are also progressing well with our monoclonal antibodies program, targeting pain treatment for dogs and cats. This will strengthen our leadership position for pain in dogs and allow us to expand into cats. I will provide further updates as we move through the regulatory process.","Our R&D team also continues to enhance our internal portfolio with lifecycle innovations and additional product indication such as the recent expansion of Cytopoint to cover allergic as well as atopic dermatitis in the U.S., also introducing of leading product brands into new geographies and new combinations.","Now turning to a few highlights of our third quarter results. Zoetis continued delivering strong revenue growth with 12% operational growth this quarter. Our diverse portfolio remains the foundation of Zoetis' steady and reliable performance with growth across our major species, markets and therapeutic areas. Our companion animal products performed very well in the third quarter based on continued growth in our key dermatology brands, new parasiticides and, for the first time, the addition of Abaxis diagnostic portfolio.","We see further growth opportunities for our key dermatology products in 2019. In the U.S., we expect that portfolio to continue growing although at a lower rate than 2018. We expect to continue expanding the addressable market in the U.S. and building awareness of dermatologic conditions through ongoing direct-to-consumer campaigns. Internationally, we expect higher growth than in the U.S. driven by the expansion of the dermatology market, increasing the patient share and the potential introduction of Apoquel in China, pending final regulatory approval.","Meanwhile, in livestock products, our swine, poultry and fish portfolios each delivered double-digit growth, with more modest growth in our cattle business. We expect all our species categories to show growth for the full year 2018 and also for 2019. For 2019, analysts expect the companion animal and poultry markets to outperform the overall industry growth of approximately 5%, excluding the currency impact. Swine is expected to be in line with the market growth, and cattle market growth is expected to be more limited.","Turning to profitability, in the third quarter we achieved 32% operational growth in adjusted net income, thanks to our increased revenue, improved cost structure, and tax reform. In closing, in 2018 we are confident in achieving our improved annual guidance, continuing to grow revenue faster than market, and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.","And with that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our third quarter results and guidance.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning everyone. Let me start by highlighting our continued strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income in the third quarter. As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, we delivered operational revenue growth of 12%, driven by the performance of our dermatology portfolio, new products and the addition of Abaxis' diagnostics portfolio.","Our organic operational revenue growth for the third quarter was 9%, which excludes Abaxis. Operational adjusted net income growth was 32%. We are confident in delivering our improved financial guidance for 2018 where we are narrowing our revenue guidance at the high end of the range and increasing our adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. While I will not provide formal guidance on 2019 until early next year, I believe our diverse portfolio, core capabilities and investment strategy will enable us to continue delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.","Now, let's talk about the drivers of our Q3 performance, which continued the momentum from the first half of the year. Reported revenue growth was 10% in the third quarter, which includes a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Currency depreciation in Brazil was the largest driver of the unfavourability in the quarter. We generated 12% operational revenue growth balanced across our segments with the U.S. growing 11% and International growing 12% operationally. Looking at growth by species, Companion Animal grew 19% operationally and Livestock grew 6% operationally.","Included in our operational revenue growth of 12% is 3% from Abaxis. Of the 9% organic operational revenue growth, price contributed 4% and volume contributed 5%. New products drove 2% line, with the remaining 3% driven by our key dermatology portfolio.","Price contributions of 4% in the quarter are higher than usual and relate to the timing of promotional activities in the third quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. Price contributed 2% over the first nine months of the year, which is more consistent with our expectations.","Adjusted net income grew 32% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvements and a lower effective tax rate. As I already mentioned, our key dermatology portfolio comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint continued to be a significant driver of growth this quarter with sales of $172 million, a 39% increase over the prior year.","In the first nine months of the year, we have recognized revenue of $436 million in our key dermatology portfolio with both Apoquel and Cytopoint contributing to the continued success. Consistent with our expectations for these products, Q2 and Q3 are the peak seasons for dermatitis, so we do anticipate moderated performance in Q4, particularly in the U.S. We continue to expect sales for this portfolio to exceed $500 million in 2018, and as Juan Ram\u00f3n discussed, we see continued growth as we move into 2019.","New products also continued to drive growth for Zoetis with Simparica as the primary driver. Simparica generated $43 million of sales this quarter, representing operational growth of 80% over the same period last year. We expect some moderation in Q4 as we move out of the flea and tick season in the U.S. Overall, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of this product in the highly competitive parasiticide market, and we expect continued growth both domestically and internationally.","Now before moving into the segment results, I would like to provide more visibility into the Abaxis numbers. Included in Zoetis' reported results this quarter are sales of $42 million from legacy Abaxis products since our July 31 acquisition. These sales represent two months of sales in the U.S., Canada and Latin America and one month of sales for all other international markets based on our international reporting calendar. Please note that Q3 revenue for Abaxis also includes a destocking of wholesaler inventories that we expect to continue in Q4 as we normalize wholesaler inventories consistent with Zoetis levels.","With the acquisition of Abaxis, we are adding a new major product category in our financial statements and our 10-Q filings within the revenue by major product category section called Animal Health Diagnostics. This product category will include the animal health products acquired from Abaxis as well as our legacy diagnostics products previously classified within other non-pharmaceuticals. The human health diagnostic products acquired from Abaxis will be classified within a new category called Contract Manufacturing & Human Health Diagnostics.","Now let's discuss Zoetis' segment revenues for Q3. Beginning with the U.S., revenue grew 11% in the third quarter, including Abaxis which contributed 4%. Including the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal grew 20% while Livestock grew 1%. Companion Animal sales in the quarter were driven by our key dermatology portfolio, new products, as well as the addition of Abaxis. Certain in-line product decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases. Excluding the impact of Abaxis, Companion Animal growth was 12%.","U.S. dermatology sales were $121 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the same quarter in the prior year. Simparica also had another positive quarter with U.S. sales in the quarter growing 53% over the same period last year. Revenue growth was due to increased in-clinic penetration and market share and returns on our direct-to-consumer investments. Partially offsetting growth in our Companion Animal business were declines in Revolution and Clavamox due to competition.","The U.S. Livestock business continued with strong growth in poultry and swine in the third quarter, partially offset by a decline in cattle. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics and medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Favorable market conditions in the layer market also contributed to growth in vaccines. Swine also had consistent growth in the third quarter, primarily in EXCEDE related to promotional effort. We also continued to increase market share of Fostera Gold PCV MH which launched in the first quarter this year.","In the cattle business, we saw challenges in both the beef and dairy segments related to competition and unfavorable market dynamics. We do expect the cattle market to recover sometime in 2019, however, the impact of weather, herd movements and producer profitability all play a role in the timing.","Overall, the U.S. continues to be a significant growth driver for Zoetis, particularly due to our product diversity and strategic investments, despite some temporary unfavorable market conditions in the cattle business.","Turning now to our International segment, revenue grew 12% operationally in the third quarter with operational growth in Companion Animal of 18% and operational growth in Livestock of 10%. Companion Animal product growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products Apoquel and Cytopoint, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, increased medicalization rates in key international markets and the addition of Abaxis. Livestock products benefited from favorable market conditions, including increasing demand for animal protein, new products and the impact of our field force.","Our fish business also performed very well this quarter, with operational growth of 21%. This strong growth was driven by increased market share of our pancreatic disease or PD vaccine as well as customer adoption of our SRS vaccine in Chile.","Highlighting some key markets for the quarter, in Brazil sales grew 31% operationally with Companion Animal growing 48% and Livestock growing 26%. Companion Animal revenue in Brazil benefited from strong growth in parasiticides with Simparic as the primary driver and a positive return on the direct to consumer investment. Livestock benefited from the recovery of sales that were delayed at the end of Q2 due to the national truck drivers' strike. Strong underlying demand, favorable export conditions and local promotional activities also contributed to growth in the quarter.","In the UK, sales grew 30% operationally. Both Companion Animal and Livestock contributed to this performance, with new products primarily driving growth on the Companion Animal side and fish driving increases in Livestock. Key dermatology products and new parasiticides both performed well in the quarter, resulting from field force focus and marketing promotions, which increased pet owner awareness of the brand. In fish, vaccines were the primary driver of growth, due to increased market share in our PD vaccine as well as our multivalent vaccine, ALPHA JECT micro 6.","Moving on to China, we had another great quarter, growing revenue 15% operationally, largely due to the timing of distributor purchases of our swine product. Companion Animal products also continued demonstrating growth, primarily in parasiticides and vaccines.","Australia grew 9% operationally, primarily driven by Companion Animal and sheep. In Companion Animal, Simparica and Apoquel increased sales due to the return on our direct-to-consumer investments, as well as strength of our in-line portfolio and promotional efforts in the quarter. Sheep products also benefited from continued strength in local market conditions.","Other emerging markets, particularly Vietnam, Argentina, Turkey and India, performed well. Vietnam performed well on Livestock, particularly in swine, due to increased market prices for pork. Argentina and Turkey had broad-based growth across Companion Animal and Livestock, while growth in India was largely due to strength in poultry.","Summarizing International performance, we saw new products, favorable market conditions and diversity across our portfolio all contributing to another very strong quarter for our International segment.","Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L, I want to cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 68.7% increased approximately 80 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis. This improvement reflects favorable pricing and the benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network, which were partially offset by the impact of Abaxis. Total adjusted operating expenses including Abaxis grew 11% operationally versus the same period last year.","Adjusted SG&A operational growth was 10%, primarily due to the addition of Abaxis and increased compensation-related costs. Adjusted R&D operational growth of 13% reflects increased investments in areas such as monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain and other pipeline programs, as well as Abaxis.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S. tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 32% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, improvements in gross margin, and a lower effective tax rate. These increases are partially diluted by the impact of Abaxis, which we expect to become mildly accretive in 2019 on an adjusted basis. As previously communicated, we are creating strong operating leverage, while investing in strategic areas of future growth for Zoetis including acquisitions such as Abaxis. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 34% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2017.","Now, moving to guidance for the full year 2018, our consistent revenue growth, gross margin improvement and returns on strategic investments are allowing us to narrow our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range and raise and narrow our outlook on adjusted diluted EPS. Starting with revenue, we are narrowing the range of our revenue guidance and expect to deliver between $5.75 billion and $5.8 billion in revenue, representing operational revenue growth of 8% to 9%. Excluding Abaxis' partial-year revenue which consists of five months of domestic activity and four months of International, the organic operational revenue growth range is 6% to 7%. Consistent with what I communicated the last quarter, our full year guidance includes headwinds in Q4 that I want to remind you of as you think about the remainder of the year.","Our business in Q4 2017 was very strong, so the growth off this higher base will moderate. U.S. livestock is one area where we experienced an exceptionally strong Q4. In addition, the fourth quarter of this year will also include four fewer international calendar days compared to last year, resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year. Please note that from an EPS growth perspective, Q4 will be impacted by the timing of cost of sales which were higher in the first half of 2017 when compared to the second half of 2017 as well as the timing of operating expenses.","For SG&A and R&D, we're narrowing guidance towards the high end of both ranges, consistent with our revenue performance and to support investments for future growth. Our guidance for the adjusted effective tax rate has been lowered to approximately 19% from our previous guidance of approximately 20%. This is primarily due to the impact of favorable discrete non-recurring items resulting from the implementation of U.S. tax reform. We continue to anticipate our effective tax rate going forward to be higher due to certain provisions of U.S. tax reform which will go into effect in 2019.","For adjusted diluted EPS, we are raising and narrowing the guidance and now expect to deliver between $3.08 and $3.13. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.81 to $2.90 includes preliminary estimates for certain significant items and purchase accounting for the Abaxis acquisition as well as gaining on the sale of our plant health business, which was completed in our international Q4 period.","Finally, we repurchased nearly $550 million of Zoetis shares in the first nine months of the year. We have approximately $450 million remaining under the current multiyear share repurchase plan and remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q3.","Now, to summarize before we move to Q&A, we have delivered consistent operational top and bottom line growth in the first nine months of the year, with contributions across all core species, therapeutic areas and geographies. We are narrowing our range of revenue guidance to the high end of the range and increasing and narrowing our guidance for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS. Our diversity, strategic internal and external investments, and ability to innovate, will continue to provide a platform for revenue growth that is in line with or faster than the market.","Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter. I might try to jam three questions into one. So the first, on the big three therapeutics, I have that up over 40% year-over-year. At a high level, how should we think about the rate of growth from these three blockbusters in 2019 and 2020? I think you said very healthy but maybe at a diminished rate. So, anything more that you can provide there.","Second would be just early feedback from the Abaxis acquisition. How should we think about sales force retention? And then have you kicked off any bundling in terms of price?","And lastly, Glenn, just the price of 4% in the quarter, I just want to be clear there, we should think of that more as onetime due to the year ago comp? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jon. Glenn will answer the first question. I will cover the Abaxis question and then Glenn also will provide the comments on the 4% price increase in the quarter.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, Jon, when you look at the big three, and I assume you're mentioning Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica, we've had very strong growth in the quarter and year-to-date. As we look forward into 2019 and 2020, we do still see opportunities for growth for all those products. So, particularly, with our dermatology portfolio we see continued growth in U.S. albeit at a slower rate as we have significant penetration in terms of patient share there. We're up to 63% already. We do see further opportunity continue to grow the market there as well. We should also see a very strong opportunity internationally where the penetration isn't quite at that level yet, so we do see continued growth internationally in Apoquel and Cytopoint as well.","In Simparica we continue to see very strong performance, continued adoption, and we think that growth will continue into the 2019 and 2020 as well, but again probably at a slower rate and also the impact of competition and new products that may come into that category may also impact growth going forward.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Glenn. In terms of the Abaxis integration, well, the retention of the field force I think is not \u2013 I can describe as 100% retention. And not only it's about retention, it's about the feedback that we are getting from the field force from Abaxis, which is extremely positive. They are expressing the excitement of the opportunity now to be supported by a larger company, by much more presence in our field. And the combination of the two portfolios is something that can create significant opportunities.","I think it's too early to discuss about bundling. Definitely we see the opportunity of combining the diagnostic portfolio of Abaxis, the diagnostic portfolio of Zoetis, and also the rest of the portfolio of medicines, and it's something that it's a work in progress. We see that diagnostic medicines, vaccines, are very much integrated in the clinics, so we expect that this will present a significant opportunity in the future.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","And, Jon, in terms of the price for the quarter, so like you say, the 4% is more of a onetime impact for the quarter. The year-to-date number of 2% is much more in line with what we typically expect to be able to generate from price.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. First, just a follow-up on atopic dermatitis, I think one of your competitors reported data with their IL-31 recently. I'm referring to Kindred. Just wondering if you had any thoughts there whether it's on that product or just, in general how you see the competitive landscape evolving here. I'm sure your success hasn't gone unnoticed.","Second, could you please break out Apoquel, Cytopoint, and Simparica by U.S. and ex-U.S.? And finally, if I may, Juan Ram\u00f3n, I missed your comments about 2019 expectations for livestock species. Could you please clarify that? And any additional color would be appreciated. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Alex. Good morning. So, let me discuss about the potential competition of our dermatology portfolio. Definitely this is something that we already communicated in previous calls that over time we expect competitors coming into this attractive market. It's a market that has been basically created by Zoetis. In the same way that many years ago, we also created the pain market for dogs, and even after many years and many new entrants, still Rimadyl remains the leading brand in terms of pain for dogs.","So, we are expecting competition but we also expect that we have a very strong position with the combination of Apoquel and Cytopoint and products that has been responding extremely well to the needs of veterinarians and also the needs of dogs, and we are very confident that these products will continue growing. And new competition also will expand the market and we also benefit of this market expansion from a leadership position.","Glenn will discuss about the breakdown between dermatology products, Simparica, U.S., International and also I will be covering the expectations for Livestock in 2019.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, just to break out the numbers. So, for derm for Q3, we had total sales of $172 million. $121 million of that came from the U.S., with $51 coming from International. Breaking out Apoquel, we had total sales of $134 million, the U.S. at $88 million, International at $45 million. You can then do the math for Cytopoint, the difference between the two. For Simparica, we had total sales of $43 million in the quarter, with the U.S. at $26 million and International at $17 million.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, the comments I provided for 2019 in terms of livestock were related to the market and not specific to our projection for 2019 Livestock Zoetis. What I said is that the market expect that poultry will be growing faster than this 5% which is expected growth for the overall animal health industry. Swine will be in line with the market and cattle will be much more modest growth. And this is something that, at this point, we are not yet providing the specifics of our growth in 2019, but we expect that we'll be more or less in line with the market expectations.","Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question here was just back onto the cattle here. Can you just give more specifics as to what is going to actually drive the recovery in cattle in 2019? And then the second question is just on opportunities for growth and operating margin expansion in 2019 and beyond, if you still see anything beyond what you've already said and if so, where these could come from. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Louise. We expect, as I said, in 2019 modest growth in cattle for the animal health industry. We see that prices for dairy are improving. We expect that this improve to be seen in the second half of 2018. It's taking longer. But now there are indications that these prices are recovering in the U.S. and also recovering in International market. So, we are more optimistic about dairy in 2019. In 2019, we also expect small growth, very little growth in terms of number of heads in the beef section of cattle. And combining all these elements, we expect some recovery of cattle in 2019. But as I said, cattle is expected to grow at modest growth.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","And, Louse, in terms of margin expansion, first I'll just continue to say that we're really not managing to any particular margin, but really we are managing for long-term cash flow growth and value. But when you look forward in terms of 2019 and 2020, we've previously articulated that we expect to get gross margin expansion of about 200 basis points by 2020 with 2017 being the starting point for that. So, our cost of goods as a percent of sales at that point was about 33%. We've guided 2018 to be approximately 32%, and we do expect continued improvement in both 2019 and 2020.","As we move forward, we also do expect to be able to get some leverage from operating expenses. But in 2019, in particular, as we continue to integrate Abaxis and build to make sure that we're supporting that business, that expansion may not be as strong as it may be moving forward in 2020 and beyond. But between the combination of the gross margin expansion and being able to grow expenses at a slower rate than revenue, we do expect to be able to get margin expansion moving forward.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question's from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess could we start off with capital allocation? You guys have \u2013 now that you're done with the Abaxis acquisition, wondering what else we should be thinking about in terms of how you plan to use the capital aside from the share repurchases. And then can you also comment on the pipeline, Juan Ram\u00f3n? Appreciate the comments on Simparica Trio and when you expect it. What about Europe? Are we going to see it approved in Europe before the U.S.? And then congrats on winning the Deming Cup for Operational Excellence Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. In terms of our capital allocation, we are not changing the previous capital allocation communication. So, definitely, we see and we continue seeing opportunities in terms of investing internally. We are increasing our allocation to R&D. We communicated that also we are expanding and increasing the capabilities in manufacturing. And we see opportunities in commercial, and in 2018, 2019, the opportunities there definitely will be in diagnostics and will be an expansion of our presence in International markets. So, we'll continue investing internally. And the result of this investment has been extremely positive and we'll continue making sure that we have the resources to generate long-term growth.","In terms of BD, the second priority in terms of capital allocation, we just completed the acquisition of Abaxis. We also had some other minor acquisitions, Smartbow, that it also a company that will be providing sensors and also the opportunity for more data analytics, digital in the dairy farms. And it's an area that we are also very interested ensuring that we are developing the internal capabilities in terms of digital data analytics there to provide this value to our customers. And we'll continue with returning the excess capital to our shareholders. It will be through dividends. It will be through buying shares back. Nothing has changed, and definitely we still see opportunities of, as I said, continue investing internally, identifying external opportunities and returning this excess capital.","In terms of the pipeline, well, Simparica Trio has been filed in both the U.S. and also Europe. When this will be coming to the market, it's to be seen because it's depending on the regulators. But definitely, we expect that Simparica Trio will be in the market sometime in 2020. Who will be first, it's to be seen.","There are some other products that also we'll see even earlier than 2019. For example, we are also expecting that in the U.S. we'll have lifecycle innovation with Revolution Plus and combining Revolution Plus active ingredient with a combination of other agents that we will expand the protection not only to fleas and ticks but making it stronger for ticks. And this is something that we expect this Revolution Plus coming into the market in 2019. And we'll continue also bringing in some other products in 2019 in the U.S. and also international markets, especially lifecycle innovation.","I also mentioned that we are expecting the approval of Apoquel in China. Again, it's subject to regulatory approvals, but it can be sometime in 2019 and this will also help us to continue growing Apoquel or the dermatologico for Zoetis. And China now is one of our top markets for companion animal within Zoetis. So, it's probably a good opportunity that we see the introduction of Apoquel in this market.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. A couple of questions here, you mentioned some de-stocking as it relates to Abaxis, but can you provide any sort of metrics on the integration process there and traction you're seeing in terms of in-customer instrument placement trends or consumables growth, and as we think about modeling out the diagnostics segment that you'll be breaking out, should we consider that a double-digit grower when studying your own diagnostics portfolio?","And then the second part of my question is how you think about a potentially kind of evolving supply chain in pet medications and do you think that it is rapidly evolving or evolving to some extent that consumers have more choice and veterinarians have more choice? And what do you think about broader implications, newer concepts such as Vets First Choice and your ability to realize price thereon? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Erin. So, in terms of Abaxis performance (42:06) I think it's \u2013 well, the integration of the closing of Abaxis has been at the mid of this quarter. I think it's probably a little bit too early to provide the full details of the different elements of the diagnostics implementation in the clinics. This is something that we'll discuss what will be the level of information that we'll be providing in the future. And maybe we can have this discussion in the fourth quarter when we have the full quarter already reporting and having all the elements that are under control by Zoetis.","Glenn will be talking about the de-stocking question that you raised.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes. So, just to give a little more color into the Abaxis numbers. So, we referenced that we had $42 million of sales in Q3. Just a reminder, that includes two months of U.S. and one month International, so it's a partial quarter. Of that $42 million is also $7 million related to human health diagnostics, so the animal health diagnostics piece of that $42 million was $35 million.","To get to your question on growth for the quarter a little bit, Erin, if you take some of the pro forma information and then put that together with what I just referenced in terms of the $35 million, again it's not 100% audited or accurate because we're piecing together different pieces of information. But you would get to mid-single digit growth for the quarter for the legacy Abaxis business. Now, that does also include the de-stocking that I referenced which we do expect to continue into Q4. But if you were to adjust for that de-stocking, we get to double-digit growth in the Abaxis portfolio which we do expect to continue moving forward at double-digit growth rate.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And Erin, what we expect from animal health diagnostics growth trend long-term is that we'll be growing faster than the animal health core business medicines, and I think it has been, in the past, growing at 7%, 8%. We also expect that in the future we'll be growing higher than the 5%. And where we see significant opportunities for growth is in International markets. And we are now expanding our presence and we are convinced that we have a significant opportunity to penetrate in this market.","You also asked about the U.S., changes in the distribution retail channel, talking about Vets First Choice or internet pharmacy (44:42), well, definitely, it's a lot of changes in this segment, companion animal in the U.S. We see some of these changes also having the positive impact of expanding the market, having much more access there for pet owners, at the same time the opportunity also to increase compliance. But at the same time, we are convinced that veterinarians will remain at the center of healthcare decision especially in areas that will require prescription and intervention of veterinarians with injectables or vaccination or acute treatment in the Companion Animal. And we'll continue supporting the veterinarians really to deliver value to our pet owners.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Congrats on the quarter, guys. I have a couple questions I'm going to roll into one but it's going to be focused on some of the innovation of the portfolio. You talked about the additional indications for Cytopoint, the allergic dermatitis. Can you give any sense of how much that expands the potential for that product, near-term in both as we go into 2019 and 2020?","And then regarding some of the other innovation, the lifecycle extensions in Draxxin and Vanguard, some of the work you mentioned, the focus on the pain monoclonal antibody. Just to get a sense of how big of a contributor this could be in 2019, 2020 as some of these new products come in. And then along that line, one last one is we saw some news reports that the USDA was potentially granting you a license for an African swine fever vaccine that's in an open comment period. Can you talk about the potential for that market? Obviously, there's a lot of talk in the swine markets about the disease outbreaks there, so, any sense of timing or potential impact? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Mike. So, let me cover the question on additional label indications for Cytopoint. So, in allergies there are four main reasons for this condition. So, one is related to fleas, the other one is food, and the third one is the environment. Anything which is not in these three areas is described as atopic. Now, Cytopoint also have the indication of allergy, not only atopic indication, and this will help us really to promote what all the indications of Cytopoint. We are not expecting significant revenues because of that, but definitely it's an area that in our opinion veterinarians has been using Cytopoint based on their own understanding of the needs. But the fact that we'll be now promoting a broader label, we will always help, but we don't expect a significant incremental revenue. We expect that the market in the U.S. still has a potential for expansion and also we expect that our patient share also can increase with the right interactions with the veterinarians and the right communication with the pet owner. And this is applicable to the U.S. and also International.","In terms of pipeline contribution in the near-term \u2013 well in the near term, we discussed about near-term 2019, so the pipeline will be mainly related to lifecycle innovation. We'll always be introducing some new vaccines, new product, but we expect significant introduction of new products in 2020. And we'll have the opportunity to discuss in February the details of our guidance for 2019 and also how we see 2019 in terms of the different sources of growth, our current portfolio, new product introduction and also price.","You also asked about the African swine fever and the collaboration with the USDA. This is something that will take several years to see a vaccine in the market to protect pigs against the African swine fever. But definitely, it's an area that has significant impact and we have seen the impact now in China and also in some other markets. It's affecting the production of pork. But what I think is even more important that what is the short-term opportunity for developing a vaccine to protect pigs against the African swine fever is the confirmation that Zoetis is the banner of choice with the USDA and many other institutions when we need to bring new vaccines into the market. And this is, in my opinion, what is important at this moment in the collaboration that we are establishing between us and the USDA.","Next question?","Operator","The next question is from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jon Kaufman - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So, a question on the monoclonal antibody products, is there anything more you can tell us? What stage of the development process are they in and when do you expect them to come to market? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, I think it's too early to indicate when the product will be in the market. So, what I can tell you is that we are making a very good progress. So, we have several products for both dogs and cats. We are very optimistic about these products reaching the market. And as I said, I will provide to you more updates as we start the process of filing the dossier into the FDA and also the European agencies. And then when we have that information, then I will be providing more details of when we plan to have the product into the market.","Next question?","Operator","The next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions, just one coming back to some of the earlier comments on OpEx going forward and expense growth. You've obviously stepped up spend this year supporting the pipeline and the new launches, sounds like 2019 might be another year of investment with Abaxis. I guess my question is once we get beyond that spend, should we think about OpEx growth slowing back down to more inflation-type growth that we've seen historically for the company? Or are we in a sustained period here where we should think about OpEx growth kind of above inflation, maybe closer to topline just given the variety of new products that you seem to have targeted for the next few years?","My second question was just on the Simparica Trio and maybe just taking a step back. Maybe just put in context how much larger of an opportunity do you see for that product relative to Simparica today as we just think about that 2020 and beyond opportunity. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. Well, I would probably share my general comments about OpEx, and then also Glenn will provide more details. So, we have seen 2018, maybe also 2019 as a years in where we are building some additional capabilities in our commercial infrastructure, has been also two years where we see additional opportunities to invest in R&D, and this is driving that higher growth in terms of operating expenses than in previous years.","In the long-term, I think we'll remain in line with previous communications that operating expenses will be growing in line with inflation. But it's also true that we have seen significant changes in our business, the inclusion or addition of Abaxis. We also included some other areas where we need some additional capabilities. And there are now new opportunities that we have seen also in digital and also in terms of data analytics. All these it's, well, creating the need of further investment but as I said, it's something that we see as temporary, and then over time, moving into the long-term growth in line with inflation.","Glenn, do you want to add some additional comments here?","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add particularly for 2019 as you look at it, I mean, one of the key drivers of the expense growth for 2019 will be the fact that we'll have a full 12 months of the Abaxis portfolio and expenses supporting that portfolio in 2019 versus only a partial year this year. And we'll also still be in the build phase for some of the diagnostics field force that we're building in both the U.S. and International.","As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, once we move forward into 2020, we would expect particularly the G&A line to then trend much more in line with inflation, and selling in particular, we would expect expenses to be slower than revenue growth from a selling perspective as well. R&D, we'll continue to look at the opportunity and to the extent that there are opportunities to drive future short-, medium- and long-term growth, we'll make the right investments from an R&D perspective.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of Simparica Trio and the incremental opportunity compared to Simparica, we are very pleased with the performance of Simparica. So, we are now on the nine month close to $150 million, $144 million (sic) [$125 million]. But still we are significantly underrepresented in the oral parasiticide market and where NexGard or Bravecto are generating much more significant sales. And one of the reasons were that we were several years behind competitors in terms of introducing these products. We are confident that with the Simparica Trio we'll be bringing a product that would be highly competitive and also we'll have the opportunity to capture part of the revenues which are today on internal parasiticides and also heartworm provided by other products.","So, the opportunity in Simparica Trio, it's to capture higher share in terms of the overall market of oral parasiticides and expanding to internal parasiticides. So, we'll provide in the future when we have probably closer to the launch what can be the expectations of Simparica Trio.","Next question?","Operator","The next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just two quick questions on Companion Animal. First is, in the past you've estimated the U.S. market penetration of your derm products is around 59%. Is that good or has that increased? And the second question is also on companion animals, derm and Simparica trends have been very strong, but how should we be thinking about the underlying, the base business? Is that flattish or growing slightly going forward? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, thank you, Kathy. So, you're correct, so the 59% share, it was related to patient share for Apoquel, Cytopoint. This was in previous quarters. Now we have increased to 63% in the U.S., and we are significantly lower in International markets. And again, so, International markets is where we see the opportunity of first expanding the dermatology market and also increasing our penetration with the market share.","You also asked about the base business excluding I guess Apoquel, Cytopoint, Simparica, I guess this is the question. Maybe, Glenn, you can answer that.","Glenn C. David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yes. So, when you look at the base business in the U.S., if you exclude the derm products, volume growth is declining. That is partially offset by some positive increase in price. But overall, volume growth is declining, and that is driven by some competitive pressures that we're seeing on some of our more established products such as Revolution and Clavamox as they face competition, A, from other new products but also from generic competition. But the impact that we're seeing there is very much in line with what we expect from a long-term perspective once we lose exclusivity in terms of the 20% to 40% over an extended period of time.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much, and congrats on the performance. I have a couple questions related to the Trio opportunity. The first is have you filed all of the components of the application with the FDA?","Second, I believe that, Juan Ram\u00f3n, you said 2020, which I believe is a delay from the prior comments of second half of 2019 approval and launch. Could you comment on that? And third, do you have 100% heartworm protection in the product? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. Let me confirm that Simparica Trio has been filed with all the different sections in the FDA. And I thought that in previous communications we were saying that we are expecting the Simparica Trio to be in the market in 2020, and we can maybe check if there was any confusion here, but I want to confirm that we expect this product in 2020. And let me \u2013 I think we are very confident that the product, Simparica Trio, will have full protection for heartworm. But let me confirm with our scientists what will be the level of protection in terms of percentage. But we are very confident that the efficacy of the product for internal and external will be excellent. So, this is one of the reasons why we are confident that the product will have a significant opportunity once it's launched into the U.S. and also in International markets. Let me say that in International markets, maybe the opportunity is lower than the U.S. because heartworm outside of the U.S. is less prevalent. So, the biggest opportunity for Simparica Trio will be in the U.S.","Next question?","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix for closing comments.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you for your attention.

I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially for those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP.

We will also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another solid quarter, demonstrating our steady and predictable growth, and confirming the strength of Zoetis as the industry leader in animal health.","The diversity of our portfolio in terms of geographies, species and therapeutic areas, as well as our business model continues driving our performance. In previous years, we have seen different species leading our growth based on changes in market trends and the mix of products in our portfolio.","For example, in 2013, our growth was driven largely by swine and poultry products. In 2014, it was driven by cattle and swine. And in 2015, companion animal and cattle led the way. This quarter, the most significant operational growth driver by far has been our portfolio of companion animal, a trend we expect to continue through 2016.","Our companion animal business is growing, thanks to the increasing sales of APOQUEL, the addition of Abbott Animal Health products, the introduction of new vaccines in Europe and the U.S., and the overall positive performance of the rest of our portfolio. It is important as we experience softer growth in livestock.","We continue to invest across our portfolio, and during the first quarter, our R&D investment continued to show many positive results, including the approval of SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide in the U.S., Brazil and Canada. This quarter also marked the completion of our ERP implementation. After nearly two years, all our commercial operations, manufacturing plants, and support functions are on a single platform, enabling us to achieve greater efficiency. Overall, we have been able to accelerate our operational efficiency program with a positive impact in 2016 and we expect to exceed the initial savings target of $300 million by 2017.","I am pleased to say that with the positive momentum in the business and the help of improved foreign exchange rates, we are increasing our guidance for the two-year, 2016 and 2017.","Coming now to more detail on our first quarter results. Operational revenue growth was 12% and you can find a slide on our webcast that break this down. These reflect six extra days in the quarter due to the accounting calendar, as well as the negative impact of changes in markets like Venezuela and India, and the product SKU rationalization that we communicated last year. Adjusting for these factors, the growth will be 10% operational and 6% excluding the additional impact of recent acquisitions.","In the quarter, we grew adjusted net income by 28% operationally, once again growing faster than revenue and helped by the fact that our OpEx increased only 2% operationally compared to the 12% revenue growth. We continue to deliver our long term valuable position of growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.","In looking at the overall market, we continue to see the animal health industry performing well, despite global economic challenges. We have seen good growth in most markets as greater consumption of proteins and increased medical spending on pets continues to help create customer demand for our products.","As always, while I'm very pleased with the quarterly results, I also want to emphasize the need to look at our business on a full year basis to account for some of the seasonal situations and timing patterns in animal health.","Let me now update you on our new product launches and R&D developments. APOQUEL is showing a steady growth. We have continued to launch APOQUEL in each of our markets such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we plan in the coming months to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where it has been approved, including Japan, Brazil and Mexico. And this month, the product will be available to customers without restrictions.","In the first quarter, APOQUEL sales were approximately $50 million, an increase of about $40 million from the year ago quarter. As previously communicated, we expect APOQUEL to generate peak sales of more than $300 million.","As far as SIMPARICA, our new once monthly chewable tablet for the treatment of fleas and ticks, it was launched in the U.S. and in several European markets. It is early, but we are hearing a positive response from our customers and we expect performance to ramp up in the remainder of the year.","We are also developing the combinations of the sarolaner molecule in SIMPARICA with other agents. This would cover a broader spectrum of parasites, including heartworm and we see sarolaner as a strong platform for future lifecycle innovations. Our canine antibody therapy that targets and neutralizes IL-31 to help treat atopic dermatitis in dogs has been introduced to veterinarian dermatologist in the U.S. under a conditional license. And we received another conditional license in Canada in the first quarter. We are hearing a very positive customer feedback and we are gaining market experience with the product.","We continue to allocate our capital for investments in key commercial activities, R&D programs and business development opportunities that can generate faster revenue growth. For example, vaccines and genetics are two areas. We are expanding our portfolio as we put greater R&D emphasis around disease prevention. And in the first quarter, we had several positive developments.","We received approval of RUI LAN WEN, the second vaccine resulting from our joint venture in China and the first combination vaccine in China to help protect pigs against a certain locally prevalent disease. We also gained approval in China for our poultry vaccine to help prevent Marek's disease.","In the U.S., we have now received licenses from the USDA for a new VANGUARD B Oral vaccine and three new VANGUARD Rapid Resp Intranasal vaccines. Zoetis is now the first and only manufacturer to offer oral, intranasal and injectable options for vaccinating dogs against Bordetella bronchiseptica.","We also granted a conditional license in the U.S. for an Avian Influenza Vaccine to help prevent diseases caused by the avian influenza virus H5N1. We are participating in a process to supply the USDA with this vaccine for the Stockpile should they decide a vaccination strategy is needed.","We're also seeing progress in genetic tests, as our farm animal customers want more information about traits and conditions that can help them build a healthier and more productive herd. During the quarter, in the U.S., we launched CLARIFIDE Plus, the first commercially available genetic test that gives dairy producers a direct way to predict risk factors for costly diseases in hosting dairy cattle. And just last month in Chile, we launched the ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon, the first attenuated live vaccine against SRS. This was a significant R&D achievement by PHARMAQ, and a much needed product to help Chilean fish farmers, great news for the industry and a terrific new opportunity for Zoetis.","In summary, we are off to a good start for 2016, based on the strength of our diverse portfolio and the continued benefits of our R&D investment. We have been able to accelerate our efficiency program and expect to exceed initial savings target of $300 million by 2017. And finally, with improved foreign currency rates and the positive momentum of the business, we are increasing our guidance for the full year 2016 and 2017.","With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. I'm going to hit on many of the themes covered by Juan Ram\u00f3n because they're important to the financial review of the quarter. So, let's talk about our first quarter performance. I'll walk you through a number of factors that you should consider to gauge how we did in Q1. There's some helpful information on the webcast slides and, of course, included in our press release. I'll then hit on a few other highlights in the quarter results and discuss our updates to guidance.","Now, before I jump in the quarter, let me say that we know that the U.S. financial markets are quarter-centric and not to naucify quarterly modelers, but in any quarter, a lot of noise can and does creep into the comparison with the prior-year period. In our discussion and our webcast slides, our objective is to try to highlight for you the major elements of the noise in our results so that you can calibrate how our reported performance might influence your thoughts about our future prospects. The most important thing about our first quarter performance is that the results for Q1 supported an improvement to our outlook for the full year 2016.","So, with that background, let me cover two important points that will enable me to put our 12% operational revenue growth in perspective. First, we operate on a 4-4-5 financial week calendar, with our International operations closing one month ahead of the U.S. Now, this is a carryover from our days as part of Pfizer. Under our 4-4-5 calendar, every handful of years you'll have a quarter in a year that has as many as six extra calendar days in it. That's what we have in Q1 2016 compared with Q1 of 2015. We estimate that the additional days account for approximately 6% of the 12% operational revenue growth for Q1 2016 versus 2015. Important safety tip for those with quarterly models out there, our fourth quarter this year will have five fewer days than the prior-year quarter and the full year 2016 has one more calendar day than 2015, this being a leap year. So, that's the extra days.","Second, our operating efficiency initiative was a drag on our operational revenue growth in the quarter. We estimate that the combination of the eliminated SKUs and the changes to our business models in Venezuela, India and other countries reduced operational revenue growth by some 4%. So, think about it like this. 12% operational growth for the quarter, minus 6% for the extra days, plus 4% for the impact of the efficiency initiative, equates to a normalized growth rate of approximately 10%. Of that 10%, roughly 4% came from acquisitions including Abbott, PHARMAQ and other smaller transactions. So our organic operational growth in Q1 was circa 6%, and including acquisitions, was 10%. So, not 12%, but pretty good, right?","Now, highlights for the first quarter, very high level. We've now entered what I previously referred to as the golden age of our companion animal business. With full supply of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA, a refreshed companion animal vaccine line, and the conditional license for IL-31, we are positioned to deliver significant growth in our companion animal business in 2016 and beyond.","On a normalized basis, organic operational revenue growth, which adjusts for the six extra days, the impact of the operational efficiency initiative and M&A, we had about 20% growth in companion animal in Q1 compared with Q1 of 2015, and the growth was reasonably consistent between the U.S. and the International segments. On the same normalized constant currency basis, livestock was up 1% with solid performance in the International segment, offset by a decline in the U.S. Q1 of 2015 was a particularly strong quarter in U.S. livestock and there were a number of other factors that I'll touch on later. Our livestock business both in the U.S. and International segments are healthy and poised to contribute to revenue growth in the remainder of the year.","Stepping down the P&L, our adjusted gross margin hit an all-time high of 67.4% in the quarter, a bit above the high end of our full year guidance range. But I'll point out that from a gross margin perspective, many things fell on the favorable side of the line during the quarter \u2013 mix, level of scrap, et cetera. Our expectations for gross margin for the full year continue to be in the range of 66% to 67%.","In operating expenses, total adjusted OpEx grew 2% on an operational basis, but if you remember those extra six days, they impact our expenses as well. Our progress in reducing operating cost continues and we are on track to deliver on the promises of our operational efficiency in this initiative in 2016 and expect to enter 2017 having taking more than the targeted $300 million of costs out of our company.","With our gross margin expansion and active efforts to contain operating costs, our 12% reported operational revenue growth translated into 37% operational growth in adjusted operating profit and 35% operational growth in adjusted income before tax. The EC's actions last January were a key driver of the 350 basis point rise in our adjusted effective tax rate to 30.9%, which resulted in our adjusted net income in the quarter rising 28% operationally.","Our purchase of shares, which began in Q1 of 2015 \u2013 started in January 2015 \u2013 helped to reduce our fully diluted share count from 503.2 million in Q1 of 2015 to 499.5 million in the current quarter, and that led to operational growth of adjusted diluted EPS of 29%.","So, that was a very quick walk down our P&L for the quarter. Here are a few more contextual details that I believe will help you think about our performance.","First, FX. Dare I say that we may have found the bottom of the cycle? Maybe not, but the environment has improved for sure. Foreign exchange had a negative 700 basis point impact on our revenue growth in the first quarter compared with Q1 of 2015. That's a big hit. But based on current rates, the FX impact on our growth will lessen over the remainder of the year. While we continue to measure our performance on an operational or constant currency basis, it just feels better when the gap between operational and reported results narrows.","Next, the SKU reduction and the changes to our business models in countries like Venezuela and India reduced our operational revenue growth by roughly 400 basis points. You should expect the growth drag on the full year to be roughly 500 basis points, so more of a negative factor compared with the prior year for the next nine months and particularly in Q2 and in Q3. Importantly, the impact of the SKU reduction and the changes in business models are felt more in our International segments than in the U.S. and more in livestock than in companion animal.","Let me step through the elements of the 12% operational revenue growth in Q1. Price accounted for 3% of the growth, APOQUEL volume another 3%, 4% from acquisitions, 6% from growth of in-line products and minus 4% from the impact of the SKU reductions and changes to business models in Venezuela, India and other countries.","Companion animal was the star of the quarter. Revenue growth normalized for both the six extra days and the impact of the efficiency initiatives increased 20% operationally. APOQUEL was the major driver, but other products contributed as well including vaccines as well as the Abbott acquisition. We also expanded U.S. customers' access to a number of our companion animal products to third-party distributors and that change led to a one-time in semi-permanent buildup of their inventories during the quarter to establish their base level.","In livestock, we had lots of puts and takes. The normalized organic revenue growth was 1% operationally with the International segment up 5% and the U.S. segment down 9%. First, let's talk about International. The France livestock rebounded as the anti-infective sales in the quarter were higher when compared with a very light Q1 of 2015, which was caused by new legislation last year. Australia livestock also pushed the strong quarter with better weather playing a role. In Brazil, we benefited from above average price increases and continued favorable conditions in the cattle segment, which were in part offset by the negative impact or SKU reductions.","In U.S. livestock, a mild winter was a major driver of lower cattle product sales in the quarter. With milder weather, there was a less risk of disease incidents and that impacted our premium products. We also saw decline in swine products due to increased competition.","In summary, after adjusting for the noise, we had a solid quarter from a revenue perspective and through the ongoing programs to improve efficiency, delivered an improved gross margin, contained operating costs, and posted strong growth and profits.","Switching to restructuring charges, let me quickly review this quarter's one-time charges related to certain significant items. First, the stand-up costs, which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $12 million in the quarter, down about half from the prior year. That work continues to wind down and will be substantially completed later this year.","In the second bucket, cost related to the efficiency initiative, we recorded $5 million of costs, which were more than offset by $33 million gain associated with the sale of four manufacturing sites in certain products as part of the efficiency initiative during the quarter. Interesting \u2013 rather than the gain, I like to think about it from a gross cash perspective. Gross pre-cash proceeds from the sale of the sites was $75 million. We have additional assets for sale including a transaction in Taiwan, which closed last Friday and any impacts from those sales would further affect cost in this second bucket.","Finally, we recorded $3 million of cost associated with our ongoing supply network strategy initiative. We're still in the early days of that initiative. We also did record a one-time net tax charge of approximately $35 million in the quarter relating to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for periods from 2013 through 2015.","Now, turning to guidance. There are four factors that lead us to narrow and raise our guidance for 2016. First, let me cover the easy one, FX rates. We refreshed our guidance for our current FX rates and that was certainly a help in our guidance. Second, in the first quarter, our International segment was stronger than we had expected and we're confident that strength will carry through the balance of 2016.","Third, we are more confident in our expectations for APOQUEL as we put supply issues behind us and have launch plans in place in new markets and they're well underway. And fourth, we reduced our guidance for our 2016 effective tax rate on adjusted income by 100 basis points. This is due to changes in our projected mix of income by jurisdiction as a result of internal restructuring of our International operations.","If you want to calibrate the various factors, at the midpoint of our guidance range for adjusted EPS, we raised guidance by approximately $0.10 a share, I'd be remiss if I didn't say it's actually $0.105, but it's $0.10 a share for this purpose. Roughly $0.03 comes from FX, roughly $0.04 comes from stronger operational performance and the reduced tax rate added roughly $0.03. I hope that helps you think about the change for the guidance. For 2017, the only change we made at this point are based on changed FX rates.","So, to go through it for 2016 and 2017. For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue between $4.775 billion to $4.875 billion, reported diluted EPS of between a $1.41 and a $1.56 per share and adjusted diluted EPS of between $1.83 to a $1.90 per share. For the full year 2017, we now expect revenue between $5.075 billion to $5.275 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $2.01 to $2.19 per share and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.24 and $2.38 per share.","Now, to summarize, we enjoy a diverse product portfolio, global footprint and productive R&D that together enable us to balance fluctuations across different species, therapies and markets, and deliver consistent revenue and profit growth over time. We are well down the road of improving the efficiency of our operating expense structure, leading to improved margins and we're on track to achieve an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% in 2017. With the continued focus on expense efficiency, we expect to deliver operating profit growth faster than the revenue growth.","Last but certainly not least, we strive to intelligently allocate our capital and actively manage our capital structure to drive shareholder returns.","That's it from my prepared remarks. Let me turn it back to Juan Ram\u00f3n before we get to Q&A.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Paul. And before we begin the Q&A, I wanted to mention our personnel development. So beginning July 1, John O'Connor, will be promoted to the role of Vice President of Corporate Strategy, Business Analytics and Enterprise Risk Management for Zoetis; and Steve Frank will now lead our Investor Relations program; John will be reporting to Alejandro Bernal, Executive Vice President, President, and Group President of Corporate Strategy, Commercial and Business Development. John has done a great job as Head of Investor Relations over the last two years, and I wanted to thank him for those contributions. He will continue to be a valuable advisor to me, to Paul, and Alejandro in his new capacity. I am pleased to say that John will leave the Investor Relations program in good hands, and there is Steve Frank.","Steve has a great knowledge of our industry and business, having worked in animal health for the last 15 years, and has been involved in our recent acquisition of PHARMAQ, Abbott as well as our IPO. Many of you know Steve, and he has been working with John in IR since 2014 to prepare for this opportunity. I'm sure we will have a seamless transition.","With that, let me open the lines for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we will take our first question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning folks and congratulations on the quarter, and congratulations, John, on the promotion. I'm not sure if I got the April cost sales. If you don't mind repeating what the April cost sales were by region? And could you also comment on some of the vaccines that you are developing on your livestock business, particularly the avian vaccine. Thank you very much. We'd appreciate it.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, the first question on APOQUEL. Total revenues for APOQUEL in the quarter were $50 million, and U.S. generated $35 million, and in International markets $15 million. These, I guess, it's answering your question on APOQUEL. You also ask about new vaccines. On new vaccines, we have new vaccines for companion animal, and this has been introduced in Europe as well as in the U.S. I mentioned new vaccines that are in the U.S. covering oral injectable intranasal, and I mentioned this for a specific Bordetella bronchiseptica disease. So, this is something that definitely represents a significant upgrade on our portfolio for companion animal infections.","We also launched a new vaccine in China, used for swine, and it is combination of vaccine for PRRS with a combination for swine fever in pigs. So another opportunity for increasing our presence in China, and increasing our presence in the swine market in China. That is a significant opportunity for Zoetis.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So you guys talked about maybe exceeding your operational efficiency target of $300 million. I was wondering if you could give more color there on the potential upside, and then how this could positively impact your 2017 guidance and margin expectations? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we already incorporated in our guidance for 2017 the potential exceeding of the $300 million. At this point, we have not provided any concrete amount of this existing opportunity \u2013 is something that in the future. As we move into the programs, we'll be sharing that with you. Next set of question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","A follow-up to that question on the restructuring, SKU rationalization and overall cost structure initiatives. How should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? And then as a second question, how would you characterize the current environment in the U.S. livestock business? You mentioned weather impacting the business in the quarter, but how should we think about the dynamics now? Thanks.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Erin, it's Paul. I'll take the how do you think about the OpEx roll out. As we said, we expect to enter 2017 with the cost structure trim down to its new inefficient level. We have some work to go on that and I think that if you're a quarterly modeler, I know you are, I think you got to think about it as continuing to show in positive impact through Q4. It's not like we're going to finish this in Q2, we're not going to finish in Q3, there is more to come that you will see evidenced in our cost structure in Q4. So, I don't know if that exactly answers it. But, yes, suffice to say that the improvements will continue to occur throughout 2016 and with a good chunk in Q4 2016. Do you want to take the last one?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me cover the question on the U.S. livestock. Let me start with the cattle. On the cattle, there are two segments, beef and dairy. Let's talk about beef. Beef, we reported that there were probably milder winter conditions that impacted our premium net products, but the fundamentals of the beef market of the cattle are very strong. We have seen that the increase in placement in feedlot. We also expect that it will continue for the rest of the year and also we expect that at the end of the year, the number of cows in beef will be increasing by 2% to 3%. So it's something that even if we have seen some temporary impact in the first quarter, we want also to see this business on a yearly basis and we're confident that on a yearly basis the market remain very strong.","In dairy, what we have seen is the global prices for milk has been going down. This is also resulting in some negative impact in dairy customers. And in some of the cases, we expect that they will be reducing the number of dairy cows. Again, so it's a cycle that we have seen also in previous years. After a cycle of low price reduction of cows, it will be another cycle where prices will go up and then they will be rebuilding the herd. So, we don't see that this is something that is concerning on medium, long-term process for the business.","In swine, we reported that we are facing some additional competition for vaccines. It's a similar case that we saw in the past with companion animal. We identified this need in companion animal. We have been working to upgrade our vaccines. Now our vaccines in companion animal are very strong and we are doing the same with swine. So, we are working to upgrade our swine portfolio for vaccines and we're confident that this also will bring us the opportunity for growing in the future. We don't expect the swine to be a significant driver of growth in 2016.","And finally, poultry. Poultry in the U.S., I think it's a positive segment. We expect to generate the net positive growth in 2016. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Can you just talk a little bit about the strategy around dermatitis in dogs now that you've got IL-31 out there as well as APOQUEL? What are you learning about the market and how best are you using those two products? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's still very early because, first, APOQUEL has been \u2013 because of the limitations in terms of supply \u2013 has been mostly used in chronic dogs with dermatitis. We expect now that in May we are opening the market without restrictions. They will be expanding the market not only to chronic but also to acute.","In the case of IL-31, IL-31 has been introduced as a conditional license. So what we are doing is to gain experience in the market by doing some activity with dermatologists, veterinarian dermatologists. This also has the objective of collecting all the data that will support full license in terms of efficacy of the product, but we are convinced that there are two products that they are very complementary and one is oral, the other one is injectable. There are some dogs which are not managing well swallowing pills. This is something that IL-31 will cover. There also, not everyone is responding the same way to treatment. So we see that APOQUEL, in some cases, is working very well; IL-31, in some of our cases, is also working very well. So the veterinarian will have the option to choose what is the best treatment there, depending on specific cases of dogs with atopic dermatitis or with any kind of skin conditions. Finally, APOQUEL will have broader indications, while IL-31 will have the indication of atopic dermatitis. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the questions and congrats, John. First, just update on SIMPARICA and how you're thinking about the rollout of the product? I guess, should we think about a slower ramp here, given entrenched competition, and what type of share do you think Zoetis can ultimately capture of this obviously very large end market? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, as I mentioned, it's early, the introduction of SIMPARICA. SIMPARICA has been introduced in the U.S. and in a few European markets. We just plan to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product has been approved. SIMPARICA has been launched with very strong publications and comparing SIMPARICA against other products, oral and topical. And we have seen that SIMPARICA, it's showing very positive comparison in terms of faster action. So it's very fast on killing ticks and fleas and also very important. So, the SIMPARICA is keeping full efficacy during the duration of the treatment, which is also very important and much better than some of our competitors. So, we are definitely convinced that SIMPARICA will have a place in the market. I think we are not yet establishing what is the target in terms of market share, but definitely we expect that we'll gain the market share that corresponds to a company that our strength, the capabilities and our operations in the market.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's Paul. I just want to follow-on on that. I think that the overall market size is for parasiticides is about $4 billion. The dogs' portion is about $2.5 billion; the fastest growing segment are the oral parasiticides. But if you want to think about the market, it's kind of in that $2.5 billion market and I think that we believe that there are two things. One, with our footprint and the quality of our salesforces we have the opportunity to certainly penetrate that $2.5 billion market and participate in the fastest growing part.","The second thing I want to point out is, this is a self-developed product, and that means the economics of this product to us as compared with the economics of the product to Merial and to Merck that we're in license through third-parties. This is a very good product for us and we're really excited about both the prospects of penetrating their market, but also getting the fruits of our investment in R&D. So this is a great story and we'll see how it plays out.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you, Paul.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So Elanco licensed a new canine osteoarthritis drug just in the last quarter. I wonder if you could talk about that in terms of why you didn't feel compelled to license that asset and just remind us what products do you have in that area and if you're very active in terms of R&D late-stage development there and how that might impact your franchise? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you for the question, Jeff, and we believe that we have a portfolio in pain, which is very strong. We have RIMADYL in all markets. We also have in the European market another product, which is also complementary to RIMADYL, which is called TROCOXIL and very important. So we have a lot of experience in this area, and this expertise is not only in terms of commercial, but also in terms of R&D. And in R&D, it's an area of focus and we have programs in pain that I'm convinced that will strengthen our portfolio in the future.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI","Hello. Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. Congrats with the strong quarter and, John, congrats on promotion. So I have two somewhat related questions.","First, more about macro trends in general. So your official guidance for 2016 and 2017 implies a strong operational growth in terms of revenue like mid to high single-digits. So I'm wondering if we can think about this revenue growth over the longer term that just will continue to grow in line with the rest of the industry \u2013 animal health industry or at some point, we need to expect some slowdown of this trend. And second, somewhat related question is about segments. Do you have more color about the potential long-term growth in different segments of products, antibiotics versus vaccines versus other pharmaceuticals and other segments that you report? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Vlad, and let me first describe what are the macro trends. So we see that the overall macro trend that maybe are is lowering down the growth in some markets. It's not affecting the same way to our industry. And one example, so we have seen that in Brazil, the GDP, it's declining, while the GDP for agriculture including their livestock is growing. So, again, so it's \u2013 in the animal health industry, I think we cannot extrapolate the macro trends which are affecting other sectors to our trends. And our trends are based on population, it's still continue growing; middle class, which is still increasing, and also they need to improve productivity because \u2013 well, the world is being challenged with the need of more food with fewer resources. And companies like us is that we can bring this type of innovation, we have a significant opportunity for our growth. And the same drivers are also impacting their companion animal. More people, more middle class is increasing the number of pet adoptions and also very important, the amount that pet owners are spending per pet in keeping these animals healthier and to live longer.","So we are very confident that the macro trends remain positive for the animal health industry. And for Zoetis, we have been targeting to grow in line or faster than the market. In the first two years as independent company, we had been growing faster than the market. In 2016, because some one-time impact related to our operational efficiency, the reported growth will be lower. Adjusted by this factor, we expect that we'll be growing in line or faster than the market. The same for 2017. We have projected for 2017 a growth that, in my opinion, at the midpoint, is faster than the projection of the market and we have no reasons to believe that in the future we'll (sic) [we won't] continue growing in line or faster than the market.","So one of the things that are very important is that we have already all what is needed to maximize our portfolio. And very important, our R&D investment continued delivering very strong results. And we have been continue bring into the market new products, but also very important bring into the market lifecycle innovation, which is also helping to protect our future growth.","And maybe Paul can talk about trends in therapeutic areas, antibiotics, vaccines, pills that are part of our efforts to ensure that we have the right balance and the right opportunities for our growth.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. And when you think about \u2013 when people talk about anti-infectives or antibiotics, people look at our portfolio and they say, gee, you're a market leader in anti-infectives. I hear this and I see this in the news and therefore we have a lot of revenues at risk. And to put in perspective, I think what people mostly focus on the amount of anti-infective sales that we have in livestock. They're not necessarily as concerned with the anti-infectives that's used in the treatment of companion animals. We saw about $1.3 billion of anti-infectives in the livestock segment. But importantly, Vlad, first I'm going to talk about our company and our outlook.","Included in that $1.3 billion, about $1 billion of that are in the form of high value injectable products that are dosed to animals when they are sick and where the alternative is that animal could die and the animals around that animal could die. And that's why we characterize as the responsible use of anti-infectives and that is the overwhelming majority of our portfolio was products that fall into that category. And while there continues to be pressure or concern from folks generally about the use of anti-infectives and wanting to use anti-infectives, what they are mainly focused on is not treatment of sick animals, but really the use of anti-infectives in ways that would, for example, to promote growth.","Within our portfolio, about $300 million balance in livestock, that is mainly anti-infectives that are used in feed and in water. Our work with our customers and our own diligence strongly suggest that those products are being used in what we would call a \u2013 what we call a responsible way, in other words, not in sub-therapeutic doses to promote growth, but to treat sick animals. Even still, if I were looking as an outsider, I would look at that $300 million as \u2013 that's a piece I got to keep my eye on and that's a piece I'd be concerned about.","Now, back to the overall trends. Our anti-infectives continue to grow, but they grow slower than the balance of our portfolio. And just so, well, real quick, of course, that's baked into our 2016 expectations, our 2017 expectations, and frankly is baked into our folks who look at our industry generally about what the long-term growth prospects are for the industry. It's an important part of the industry, and so that's baked into the macro view of our industry to able to grow mid single-digits or better for the foreseeable future.","I'll continue on because it's a very interesting topic. We pivoted many years ago away from the development of additional anti-infectives to a focus on vaccines because the best way to reduce the use of anti-infectives is to reduce the incidences of disease. That's the best way. And we've been very successful of pivoting our R&D portfolio and now our product portfolio to feature vaccines and will assist producers in maintaining the health of their herd so that they would have to use less anti-infectives. So that's a big area for us. And we focused \u2013 I'm focusing all of this on the livestock segment because I think that's where your question lies. So I'll stop there. Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Just on the IL-31, what is your expectation in terms of timing for going from a conditional to a full approval and just obviously there's some limitations in terms of your promotion of the product right now. Just how widely is that being used in terms of veterinarians?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug for the question. So we expect but there is something that will depend on the final approval from the USDA. We expect this approval by the end of the year. So now what we are doing, it's a gaining experience and also collecting the data in terms of efficacy and this will be submitted to the USDA for final approval of the product and is related to the U.S. we have similar partner in Canada and a different one in Europe. Also, we expect in Europe this product approved in the future. So today it's used under this conditional license. So the use is quite limited because we're just going to fewer customers in the U.S. mostly veterinarian dermatologist, some other customers are using the product.","Now the objective is not really to generate significant revenue growth but to gain experience of the product and making sure that the product it's generating the amount of data that would support full license. We're convinced that IL-31 will be an important product in our portfolio and very important so it's \u2013 Zoetis, it's developing a franchise which is this skin conditions, itching, atopic dermatitis. And with two products in the market I think it might have been that we have very strong position with it the future opportunities. Next question please.","Operator","We are going next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Divya Harikesh - Goldman Sachs International","Good morning. This is Divya Harikesh on behalf of Jami Rubin. Just wanted to get your latest thoughts on capital allocation. Are there other assets that look more attractive at current valuation or areas that are of particular interest to you. Also how much leverage would you consider given the market's increasing concern on leverage levels for companies. Thank you.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Paul. I'll take that on the capital allocation front. Of course, we continue to \u2013 I think like most companies and we focus first on what kind of capital can we allocate within our company to drive incremental revenue and profit growth that is always going to be very high return activity. So, first thing we do is try to max out programs inside that can drive revenue and that falls in the bunch of categories that's \u2013 yeah that could be incremental salesforce, it could be investment in DTC advertising to grow markets, it could be incremental investment in R&D to develop new products. It could be incremental CapEx to create a technology platform. So it's all those things. So we do that first.","The second piece which is I think what you're asking about is outside. So we look outside on what sorts of opportunities do we see. We see a very consistent flow of what I'll call smaller deals that we do every single year that none of which I think on an individual basis is going to be exciting to the market at large, but in the aggregate help us one, feed our R&D effort because we can acquire technologies and things that feed R&D.","Second is small add-ons that we just continually do and yeah that can be anywhere from $40 million to $75 million a year in activity and that's relatively consistent. The next bucket would be sort of the mid-sized M&A and I think last year and, I guess, I'd put PHARMAQ in that category and maybe even Abbott in that category as well.","Lastly, we were fortunate enough to close two deals. I wish we could do that every year. The challenge is not our desire, would you do this deal. We will do those deals 100 out of 100 times if they present themselves. So we are \u2013 as I used to always love to say, we're tanned, rested and ready to do those deals when they present themselves and we're spring loaded to go after them when they present themselves but now predicting when they're going to be available is the challenge.","On the larger scale M&A, really, I guess, what you think of it as potentially transformative, we've said many times over, our transaction with one of the top five companies is very difficult for reasons of anti-trust sort of \u2013 think of it as FTC type issues because there's a lot of concentration now amongst the top, say, five companies. So, the prospect for a transaction, I'd say, never say never; it's not zero, but it would be pretty hard. And then, next down the list, there are opportunities, there we continue to look. We are very active and I should say we're very proactive in targeting assets that we think would be interesting and valuable to add to our company, but of course, we're not going to disclose what our list of targets might be at any moment in time.","And then, the last bucket is the one that I think is important \u2013 I referenced it in the tail end of my prepared remarks \u2013 and that is returning capital to shareholders. As we enter 2017, we have lots of the standup costs and the operational efficiency cost, and all those things behind us, not just from a P&L perspective, but also from paying out the accruals, et cetera, and we put that cash flow behind us, that negative cash flow behind us and we enter 2017, we still have to throw off a fair amount of cash.","And the question is, well, gee, if you don't have anything to do with it, what are you going to do? Well, a couple of things. One, we have a dividend. It's a circa \u2013 a commitment this year of \u2013 call it circa $190 million or thereabouts in 2016. We have a share repurchase program. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of 75 million a quarter under a program that we announced way back in November of 2014.","And so, long-winded but, we intend to the extent that we can't deploy that capital in our business or outside our business, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over time. We think that's appropriate. Cash is a non-productive asset for us to have around, but this also dovetails nicely into the discussion of capital structure, which you inquired about as well.","So, we have articulated that we expect to operate in the normal course of business in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 times trailing EBITDA for a debt level for our company. Operating in that range will enable us to maintain an investment grade rating \u2013 we believe will enable us to maintain an investment-grade rating \u2013 and that's important, as you pointed out. I mean, the market is taking a different look at leverage levels today than they might have two or three years ago, and we're cognizant of that.","I said \u2013 but because we get this question a lot, I'll restate it. People say would you ever do a deal that would cause you to be above that range? The answer is, yes. So, we would go above the top-end of that range to pursue what we felt was value-generative M&A. Would we go above that range to buy more stock? Probably not. In fact, I'll say definitely not. But we would in the context of making an acquisition.","And so, we get below 2.5 times. We probably put some leverage on, we get above or up to the top-end of the range at 3.5, you'd expect us to manage that leverage down. The objective is to try to operate in that range and I'll stop there. I think as to the high-end of the range, I don't know what it is.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Thank you very much. So, I was a little bit on and off the call. I just have a couple of questions on the guidance changes. So for the 2016 guidance, Paul, what percentage of the EPS guidance increase was due to operations and what percentage was due to FX? And then for 2017, obviously, you haven't updated that guidance for operating performance; you've only updated it for FX. When do you expect to update it for operating performance? Could we expect that after the second quarter results or do we have to wait until the company goes through its full-year annual planning in the fall? Any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, David. It's Paul. I'll take that. I'll go through the \u2013 the factors in \u2013 the midpoint in the range $0.10 up, $0.03 from FX, $0.04 from stronger operational performance and then the tax rate was a $0.03 helper as well and that gets you to the $0.10 raise at the midpoint of our range in 2016. You're quite right. 2017, we said, we updated our 2017 guidance solely for the favorable change in FX rates. It's 2017 guidance. We're one quarter into 2016. We have a pretty broad range there. You can surmise that our outlook continues to be in that range or we would have adjusted \u2013 or adjusted that range. So there is no set time at which we would change our operational view of 2017, but to the extent that we were outside the range for 2017, we'd change it. I'll stop there. Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. First, I just had a follow-up on the sarolaner. Could you confirm that you do have full supply now so you're ready for full global launch? And was there any stocking in the first quarter of sarolaner?","Second question has to just do on the SKU reduction, you've targeted 5,000 or roughly in total. Can you give us a sense of sort of where that's out right now and does that \u2013 is that something that just sort of goes away slowly as the year unfolds or is it more dramatic that they're kind of there until year-end? And also a sense of what therapeutic categories those SKU reductions are coming from. So as we sort of look at that, we can get sense of where some of those reductions will be coming. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Let me start with sarolaner, SIMPARICA now. The name in the market is SIMPARICA and we have no restrictions for this product. We have enough of our product to introduce the product in all markets and where the regulatory authorities have approved. And this, in the U.S., all new markets and we also have operations for Canada and some other countries. So it's something that we don't see any restriction.","So, at the time of the launch in the U.S. and also in Europe, there is no any significant loading of the product in the country. So, most of the product was related to samples that we provided to the veterinarians to get familiar with the product. So, we have not generated significant revenues in the first quarter, but we expect that these revenues would be ramping up during the rest of the year.","So, we have very good expectations for the product. As I mentioned in some of the other comments, we have very strong publications supporting the efficacy of the product. As I said, this product is working very fast and also it's showing that during the duration of the treatment, it's having very strong efficacy. So, there is no drop in efficacy at the last day of the duration of the treatment, on the contrary is maintaining the efficacy.","In terms of SKU, I think we have made significant progress on SKUs. So, most of the SKUs have been already eliminated from our portfolio, and maybe there are some few SKUs that will be eliminated from now until the third quarter, which are related to SKUs that will be replaced by other products that we are introducing in the market. But the large majority of SKUs has been already eliminated from our portfolio.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me continue on that because I think you asked the question about how it plays out over the course of 2016, and also important. We eliminate an SKU from the portfolio. If we sell it, like as we did, we sold some plants, as I said in my remarks, during the quarter and we sold it with the product. Obviously, the product is gone. We eliminate an SKU and we stop producing. We may still have inventory and we may still sell it. And so that's why you are seeing it play out over the course of 2016. But let me frame it.","Q1, we said the impact of SKU reductions was about 4%, we said that we expected to be about 5% and this is growth versus prior year. For the full year, which it says that during the nine months, Q2, Q3, and Q4, it will be greater than 5% impact from a growth perspective versus the same period in the prior year. And I further said that it's mostly in Q2 and Q3. So the middle part of the year as we sell out these products and they are gone, and what you're going to see is a moderation of that in Q4 because we did start to see a impact in Q4 of last year. And as we enter 2017, there is still going to be a drag, because you still sold them at the beginning \u2013 some of these products at the beginning of 2016. But if you look at the kind of run rate when we enter Q1 of 2017, that will be fully reflective of all of those SKUs being gone, and again, impact versus prior year heavier in Q2, Q3 of this year, moderate in Q4, there is still an impact in Q1 next year, and Q2 next year, but it diminishes pretty substantially. The cool part is, we will have this activity behind us entering 2017. Next question, please?","Operator","And we do have a follow-up from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks so much. Also, I still don't see a balance sheet in the release. I guess my bigger question here is what can you accomplish in the way of working capital improvements near-term, and to address the high inventory days? And then also, how much was the distributor stocking contribution in the quarter? I assume that's related to the vaccine business. Was that material?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it's Paul. Let me take the balance sheet and working capital questions. Yeah, we are working very hard to shrink and then eliminate the gap between when we report our earnings and when we release the balance sheet. We are expecting to file our Q Friday of this week. So, yeah, we've shrunk it to a couple of days. It had been substantially more than that. That's just a \u2013 we could not shrink those days in the context of also changing all of our ERP systems et cetera. So we are working on that and our goal is, to be like most other companies, to have our balance sheet on the same day to report earnings. So just know that that's a priority for us and we'll get there.","With respect to working capital, you pointed out to the day sales of inventory that we are on at the end of the year. We expect that we can have some pretty sizable improvements in our investment and working capital efficiency. Now with the \u2013 thank some higher power of the completion of our SAP implementation where we have every part of our company up on one instance of SAP, we now have the opportunity to activate the tools that will enable us to much more tightly manage our investment and inventory while at the same time having a high service level to our customers. That's not something that is instantaneous, that is something that we explored it and I think I've said in public forums before, we expect to make progress against that in 2016. We'd expect to make much more substantive progress on that in 2017 and that is the focus of our opportunity in being more efficient in working capital.","We're pretty good in accounts receivable. I'd say pretty good, we're good in accounts receivable and we are also good on accounts payable. So it's really inventory that we are focused on, expect a modest improvement in 2016 and more significant improvements beginning in 2017 as we get the tools up that will enable us to better manage our supply chain.","Your question regarding the distributor stocking, again that was in the U.S. That was with respect to some companion animal products to increase. So the amount that went in was approximately $18 million in the quarter. And so, it's something that you should take into consideration. Next question, please?","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n for final comments.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Great.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you very much for your attention.

Good morning, and welcome to the Zoetis Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ram\u00f3n and Paul will provide an overview of our quarterly results, and then we will open the call for your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning's call, which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of the slides used today will also be available on the website following the call.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2013 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP.

The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within Other business activities, separate from the 4 reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, John. And thank you to those joining today's call. Before beginning my comments on our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce Paul Herendeen. Paul joined Zoetis as our new CFO this past September to lead the company's finance and information technology organizations, in addition to being part of the Zoetis executive team.","I'm delighted that Paul has joined Zoetis and is on the call today. Later, he will speak with you as we review the details of our third quarter performance.","A key element of our long-term value proposition is our ability to grow in line or faster than the market. Based on most recent data, Zoetis continues to grow faster than the animal health industry. Over the trailing 12 months ending with the second quarter, the animal health market grew by 3% according to industry sources, while Zoetis grew by 5% with both percentages, including the negative impact of foreign exchange.","Our ability to grow faster than the animal health market illustrates the fundamental strength of our business model. With the broadest product portfolio in the industry, the steady introduction of new products and our top-ranked field force, we are able to bring value solutions to veterinarians and livestock producers around the world.","Now, let's turn to our operational performance during the most recent quarter. During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 10% in revenue and 21% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41. Revenue growth during the quarter was strong in all regions and in both developed and emerging markets, with emerging markets delivering double-digit growth. These are result of favorable market conditions, the strength of our diverse product portfolio and the diversity of our global presence.","Let me now comment on our livestock performance. In livestock, we grew 13% and growth was strong across all geographic segments. Producers are enjoying favorable market conditions in many parts of the world with high meat and milk prices, together with lower feed cost.","On a global basis, the outlook for meat and daily proteins remains strong. A growing middle-class in China, India and other emerging markets continues to drive growth in worldwide demand for meat, eggs and daily proteins.","Let's now take a closer look at our third quarter performance by species, starting with cattle. Cattle is our largest species and it grew 13% with all regions delivering strong growth. In the United States, we saw strong demand for our premium products, while we also generated gains gains in market share. Swine revenues grew 17% despite the challenge of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv in a number of countries. All regions contributed to this growth and we continue to expand our swine product portfolio through the introduction of vaccines with new antigen combinations as well as registering and commercializing products in new markets. Poultry revenue grew 7% with strong contributions from the emerging markets within the European, Africa and Middle East region.","Now, turning to companion animal. Companion animal grew by 5%, aided by sales of APOQUEL in the U.S. and several European countries. Strong growth of key brands in the U.S. and Europe was offset by the introduction of new products from competitors and the impact of the solution changes in Japan. While competition has affected our results in parasiticides and vaccines, we are confident in our ability to participate in this and other growing market segments as we introduce innovative products to the market.","For example, we are preparing for European launch in 2015 of Versican Plus, a new line of canine vaccines. We will cover -- I will cover Versican Plus in more details when I discuss new products and milestones.","We can also confirm that in April 2015, we expect to significantly increase APOQUEL supply. With greater supply, we expect to begin offering APOQUEL to new customers. We continue to receive very positive feedback from customers about this product. And based on current market conditions, we believe APOQUEL can achieve annual sales of approximately $200 million to $300 million at peak sales, which normally is 5 years after product introduction.","Now, I would like to share with you several products and milestones that illustrate how our singular focus on animal health and our core capabilities allow us to put our customers first and bring our solutions to their most pressing animal health needs.","Earlier in the quarter, we announced that we obtained a conditional license in the United states for our vaccine to help fight PEDv in pigs. Under a conditional license, we demonstrate safety in a field study and provide reasonable expectations of efficacy. We are now conducting additional studies to demonstrate efficacy and to obtain a full license from the USDA. The PEDv vaccine has been received very positively by swine customers and is available to them ahead of the cold weather when the virus is more likely to spread. We were able to bring this vaccine to market in only 14 months by leveraging our 3 interconnected capabilities.","Our R&D capability and the expertise in biologics allow us to fast-track the development of PEDv vaccine. Manufacturing and scale-up capability enable us to produce enough of the vaccine to meet projected customer demand. And now that the product has been launched, Zoetis representatives and our field veterinarians are partnering with our customers on how to incorporate the new vaccine into their protocols and biosecurity programs. The development of these vaccine is an example of how we leverage our capabilities to bring solutions to our customers.","This past quarter, Zoetis also received a full license for the first poultry vaccine targeting Georgia 08 type IBV. The full license followed the USDA conditional license that Zoetis received in late 2013. These are the first commercially vaccine to help reduce disease cause by the virus strain.","In our companion animal business, we received European approval for Versican Plus. This is a combination canine vaccine that provides unmatched leptospira protection as well as a greater convenience and flexibility for veterinarians. It provides protection against obtained bacterial and viral infections in one vaccine dose. By offering multiple vaccine combinations, Versican Plus provides a comprehensive solution for European markets that accommodates a broad range of vaccination protocols. We are now preparing the launch of Versican Plus in the European Union in 2015.","Also, we announced the formation of a new collaboration with Easter Bush Research Consortium that is focused on combating emerging infectious diseases in Europe. Zoetis will partner with others in this consortium to detect and identify emerging infectious diseases early and to develop medicines and vaccines to treat and control them.","Zoetis is the only animal health company in this consortium. Collaboration like this one contributes to our ability to be first to know about emerging infectious diseases and aspires to be first to market with new products to diagnose and prevent diseases.","And before I ask Paul to walk us through the financials and provide details on our 2014 guidance, I would like to remind you of our upcoming Investor Day. We are very pleased to be hosting an investor meeting on November 18 at the New York Stock Exchange. The goal of the meeting is to enhance understanding of the animal health industry, the key drivers of Zoetis market leadership and the strategies for future growth. I will be joined by the Zoetis executive team for a discussion of our regional businesses, R&D approach, manufacturing and supply chain operations and financial goals.","And with that, Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning. It's been a very busy and productive first 2 months and I'd like to say that the more I learn, the more confident I am that the fundamentals of our industry, our team here at Zoetis and the strengths of our capabilities provide us with the opportunity to create value for our stakeholders. I'll speak more about all this in 2 weeks at our Investor Day, but now let me dive in and review the third quarter a little more deeply and to discuss our guidance for 2014.","Turning first to the interest income statement slide. For the third quarter, revenue was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year on both a reported and operational basis. Reported net income was $166 million or $0.33 per diluted share in the third quarter, an increase of 27%. And adjusted net income was $207 million or $0.41 per diluted share, representing reported growth of 20% and 21%, respectively.","Adjusted net income from the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $41 million or $0.08 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items, the majority of which were related to standup costs.","Now, let's take a minute to discuss currencies. In the third quarter, foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our revenue or income growth. It's important to remember that our 3 international business segments have an earlier quarter close than the U.S. segment. The third quarter for the international segments closed at the end of August with the U.S. segment closing at the end of September.","Looking ahead, we expect to see a negative impact on revenue growth in the range of 250 to 300 basis points in the fourth quarter based on current rates and we expect to see similar magnitude of impact in 2015.","Now let's turn to our adjusted income statement slide, which I'll discuss on an operational basis. Again, because FX was not a significant factor in the third quarter, operational revenue growth was 10%, the same as reported. Livestock comprised 65% of sales in the quarter and grew $88 million or 13% operationally. Companion animal comprised 34% of sales in the quarter and grew $20 million or 5% operationally. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.5% of revenue versus 34.7% in the year-ago quarter. And that's due to the buildup of central manufacturing supply chain operations. This buildup was completed by the end of 2013 and those higher costs are now flowing through our cost of goods sold.","Adjusted SG&A, meanwhile, increased by 2% operationally in the third quarter. In other items, adjusted R&D expense was flat operationally and interest expense was flat at $29 million in the quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 28.3%. I would not read too much into our tax rate in the quarter. What's important is that we expect our rate for the full year 2014 to be consistent with our guidance, which is approximately 29%. And again, our adjusted net income was $207 million, representing a growth of 20% or 21% operationally.","Now let me talk for a minute about how we're tracking year-to-date on a few elements. This was a great quarter, but we always want to keep in mind the full year and that's because of the nature of our business, the cycles in the animal health industry and fluctuations in currencies in any given year.","In looking at any quarter relative to the prior year, lot of noise can creep in. The longer the time period you look at, the more that noise cancels itself out and you can see a clearer picture of the underlying trends in our business. We focus on full calendar years and do not guide or manage to quarterly results. While it feels great to put a quarter on the board with such strong revenue and profit growth, the bigger picture is that we are on track to deliver on our guidance for the full year. That said, let's take a quick look at the 9 months year-to-date and compare that back to 2013.","We're tracking in line with our revenue expectations for the first 9 months, growing revenue 6% on an operational basis. Our guidance range implies full year 2014 operational growth of 5% to 6%. Our adjusted cost of sales is at 34.9% of revenue on a year-to-date basis. As I said earlier, we continue to expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue for the year, bringing us in line with the full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue. And finally, adjusted net income is also performing in line with our expectations growing at 13% on an operational basis year-to-date. This year-to-date performances are in ranges that are consistent with our expectations, and I'll discuss the implications on our full year guidance in a moment.","Now let's turn to our operating segment results. Again, I'll discuss these on an operational basis, but I -- but it should be noted that the segment earnings are on a pretax basis and are presented on an adjusted basis.","Beginning with the U.S. Third quarter revenue was $532 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 12% with cattle and swine as the main contributors. Growth in cattle products benefited from higher demand for our premium product as producers continue to see strong market conditions. With higher prices for beef and lower input costs, producers are moving lighter animals into feed lots sooner to meet the market opportunity. These cattle can be more vulnerable to illness and disease, given their age and weight, and require more use of medicines and vaccines to maintain their health.","These market conditions also mean our customers place more importance on using our premium products to protect animals and investments. Meanwhile, swine products sales were driven primarily by the success of several recent new product introductions such as our Fostera PCV M. hyo combination vaccine. The DRAXXIN 25 anti-infective product for swine and our ENGAIN ractopamine product for use in feed. This growth in swine was slightly offset by the continuing impact of PEDv, which Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned.","In companion animal products, we generated an operational growth of 2%, driven by APOQUEL and other key brands such as ProHeart 6, Cerenia and Convenia. This growth was offset, however, by increased competition in vaccines, pain products and parasiticides.","In summary, the U.S. segment earnings increased by 10% based on the quarter's strong sales and lower expenses.","Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region or EuAfME. Revenue in EuAfME was $293 million, an increase of 12% operationally compared to the third quarter of 2013. The growth was a combination of double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Sales of our livestock products increased 13% operationally as the region delivered positive results in France and the U.K., as well as in emerging markets.","The livestock growth was driven by increased sales across all species with particular advances coming from cattle and poultry products. In France for example, we saw an increase in the sales of the anti-infectives as customers sought to buy product ahead of more restrictive legislative changes. And in the U.K., we saw strong demand for cattle products. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products increased 11% operationally, primarily driven by sales of APOQUEL in Germany and the U.K. as well as growth in parasiticides such as the Stronghold brand.","EuAfME segment earnings increased 28% operationally, primarily due to the revenue increase, improved gross margins and lower operating expenses in the quarter.","Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR. Third quarter revenue was $194 million, an increase of 17% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. In this region, we saw a significant growth in emerging markets such as Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina and also in Canada.","Overall for the segment, sales of livestock products grew 16% operationally and sales of companion animal products grew 19% operationally. Sales in Venezuela and Argentina grew significantly across all species. In Brazil, there was significant growth driven primarily by sales of cattle products, including new product launches and growth in key companion animal brands such as Vanguard, Cerenia, Revolution and Convenia, as this market continues to expand at a high rate.","Meanwhile, growth in Canada was primarily driven by sales of companion animal products. This was the result of a later spring season than last year, which had a positive impact on parasiticides sales -- the growth of parasiticides sales for this quarter as compared to last year quarter. Strong volumes in cattle and swine products also contributed to growth in Canada.","CLAR segment earnings increased 19% on an operational basis, driven by revenue growth, limited growth in operating expenses and partially offset by a decline in gross margin.","In Asia Pacific or APAC, third quarter sales were $179 million, an increase of 7% operationally compared to the third quarter 2013. Sales of our livestock products grew 9% operationally, driven primarily by sales of cattle products in Australia and growth in Southeast Asia from recently launched swine products. In Australia, we are seeing more cattle moving into feed lots and requiring more treatment as Australia continues see the impact of drought on its cattle businesses.","In the swine, we continue to see strong sales driven primarily by an increase in sales of our vaccine portfolio. Sales of companion animal products, however, were flat operationally due to an inventory buyback related to the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan. Excluding this event, operational growth would have been 8% driven by sales of parasiticides, equine vaccines in Australia and increased sales of vaccines in China.","APAC segment operating earnings increased 24% due to revenue growth, improvements in gross margin and a decline in operating expenses. That's on an operational basis.","Now let me turn to guidance for the full year 2014. As I mentioned earlier, we think about and manage our business in an annual basis and not quarterly. There can be a lot of variability in any individual quarter. For example, in revenue, the variability can be to due to changes in weather patterns or seasonality be associated with certain product lines. In R&D expenses, for example, the quarter -- quarterly variability may be based on project schedules and conditions needed to complete field trials. Our R&D expense, for example, tends to be heaviest in the fourth quarter.","Over a full year, that variability, which you have seen in pockets this year, historically evens out, and we are able to deliver a steady and predictable performance when measured on an annual basis. We remain confident on our ability to deliver on our full year guidance for 2014 and we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share for the full year and narrowing our revenue guidance towards the high end of the range.","We now expect reported revenue of approximately $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 3% to 4% for revenue and includes a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign currency. This also implies an operational growth of 1% to 5% in the fourth quarter, and that's when compared with a strong fourth quarter in 2013. After taking into consideration the current FX environment, reported revenue growth could be 250 to 300 basis points below the operational growth rate in Q4.","Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for the full year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost savings efforts, which is forecast to be offset by the full year impact of costs incurred to build our central manufacturing and supply functions as well as unfavorable mix. We understand this implies our fourth quarter cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue will be higher than what you've seen to date. However, we believe our 2014 full year guidance of approximately 35.5% of revenue is a better reflection of our underlying cost of goods sold.","Adjusted SG&A expenses are now expected to be between $1.46 billion and $1.48 billion. We continue to see good OpEx discipline in the regions, which is helping to mitigate increased spending in our general and administrative functions, where we continue to build out the infrastructure to support our business on a fully standalone basis.","Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $385 million and $395 million. We continue to deploy resources responsibly in R&D as this investment is fundamental to the enhancement and protection of our existing portfolio through life cycle developments and the development of innovative new products to help fuel additional growth.","We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29%. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS of between $1.50 and $1.54 per share for the full year. This guidance would imply full year reported growth of 6% to 9% for adjusted EPS and reflects a negative impact of approximately 200 basis points coming from foreign currencies.","Please note that our guidance does not reflect any further currency devaluation in Venezuela. Separately, we now estimate pretax charges for 2014 of between $180 million and $195 million, primarily related to standup costs and acquisition-related costs. These charges are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for our reported diluted EPS for the full year 2014 remains between $1.16 and $1.20 per share. This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving animal health market for the remainder of the year.","To sum up the quarter, we had a very strong revenue and earnings growth quarter in all regions, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We demonstrated an ability to drive gross margin improvements and operating expense containment in our regional segments while continuing to absorb some of the impact of the buildup costs associated with our corporate functions. We saw no material impact from foreign currency on our growth this quarter, but anticipate more significant effects on our future results. And we are reaffirming our guidance for the year despite the expected currency headwinds in Q4.","That concludes my prepared remarks. And now we will open the line for questions. John?","John O'Connor","Thank you Paul. Operator, we are ready to take the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Paul, congrats on the new role. Two questions here. First, can you elaborate on the U.S. companion business and competitive dynamics there? I think last quarter you mentioned you were increasing some of your promotional investments. I guess, any sign that those investments are having any impact? Or just when should we think about that business starting to maybe turn around a little bit more? And then a question for Paul, just as you're stepping into the CFO role, can you just elaborate a little bit more on your priorities? I guess, specifically, what are the biggest opportunities you see at Zoetis when you look at the company's margins, tax rate and capital structure?","Operator","It appears that the -- we're experiencing technical difficulties at this time. Please standby.","[Technical Difficulty]","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","I hope now the line is fine and I will be able to answer your questions, Chris.","Operator","Sir, you may now proceed with your answer.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay. So Chris, it's Juan Ram\u00f3n and I will answer the question on U.S. companion animal dynamics. So there are different factors driving the market in the U.S. in companion animal. The introduction of new products, mainly in parasiticides. The market is moving more to oral parasiticides compared to the previous, more topical ones with the introduction of 2 main competitors in this market. And we are participating in the market in the topical, but not on the oral. The other change that we have seen is that the introduction of new vaccines in the U.S. that also they are impacting our performance. And finally, in the pain market in where we participate with RIMADYL a very strong brand, there are also new factors affecting our performance. One, it's a competitor that was out of the market in 2012. It was back in '13 and now it's full revenues and also made it part of the shares that we gained when this competitor was not participating in this market. It's now back to the more normal situation. And also, the introduction of generic competition for RIMADYL on the chewable formulation, although this have not been representing a significant impact so far. Now, I will ask Paul to answer your question.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, thanks, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and Chris, thanks for the questions. Yes, I've been here about 60 days now. I'll tell you that my -- the first thing I see is an opportunity or I say, more as a priority for me is to help us to get complete with the standup process. Until we get through that, I think that it's going to somewhat mask our company's cash flow generation capabilities because it, obviously, while it doesn't affect adjusted net income, it obviously is a cash flow item. And so in terms of priority, both getting us past those -- that standup activity and getting the G&A infrastructure built to the point where it can support this global business has kind of been very, very high on my list. Now that said, I mean walking down through the income statement, there are opportunities for us to continue to drive operating margin improvements over time, and I think these are themes that you've heard from the other members of the team as we go -- as you go back. I mean, we've got very good expense control in our commercial groups. That's been a little bit masked by the buildup of cost in G&A. And again, once we get through that, we'll get to more of a normalized run rate for our OpEx.","There are opportunities in the gross profit margin when we look at ability to continually benefit from price increases. Second, from improvements in efficiency in our plant network structure. And those are things that although they will happen here in the near term, I think that it will take us some time to generate the most meaningful portion of those margin expansion opportunities.","Part of your question was around the tax rate. We -- when we spun out from Pfizer, we started with a tax rate kind of -- or we could have had a tax rate sort of in the 40% range. We were able to put together a structure or put in place a structure that enables us to have that tax rate down in the neighborhood of about 29%. So good from the perspective of a structure that allows us to have a much lower tax rate. Thinking ahead, I think that our ability to manage that tax rate is based on opportunities to present themselves to us that fit within our structure. I would not expect to see revolutionary changes in our tax rate, although we will do our level best to manage that tax rate down over time. And I think your last question was around capital structure. In this company, we are -- we have expressed that we wanted to maintain a level of debt in our cap structure. I think you certainly know me from my prior employer and -- I like debt, we like debt. There's a role for debt in our capital structure. We've expressed a target of 2.5x trailing 12 months' EBITDA. That's an appropriate debt load, but I will say that's a target. It's a target, where if there were an opportunity in the call -- we were called upon to lever up a little bit, we would do that, and then we would endeavor to reduce our debt over time back towards the target. And I'll stop there. Can I get the next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First one, Ram\u00f3n, could you give us a little update on the competitive landscape. Sentinel Spectrum went to a competitor, wondering what your thoughts are? And also you talked about oral parasiticides, just wondering what's on the horizon for your product portfolio? And then for Paul, you've been with the company now for only a couple of months. Congratulations again. I'm sure it's been like drinking from a firehose, but just wondering if you could give us your puts and takes from when you decided to join the company until now. And also an update on the inventory issue in Japan with the distributor.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Kevin. And I will answer the questions on Sentinel and oral parasiticides. Well, definitely as a leader in this industry, we see any transaction or any potential transaction in the market and also we are active assessing any opportunity. And definitely, Sentinel was an opportunity that we explored. And what -- as you see, we decided not to participate in this transaction. And we talked about what our programs or plan on oral parasiticides. Definitely, we see oral parasiticides an important part of preventing animals, dogs and cats against ticks and fleas and also heartworm. And we -- I would like to postpone the details of my answer to the Investor Day in -- when we have the opportunity to provide, to investors and to analysts, a more comprehensive view of our R&D approach and also some of the areas in where we are investing.","Paul S. Herendeen","And I'll pick -- Kevin, pick up from there. It's Paul. Your question was around puts and takes from prior to joining. So I've here, it's almost exactly 60 days, I think. As of today, it's 61 days. When I first looked at the opportunity, I think the thing that attracted me to it was, first looking at the industry, an industry that -- a global industry that grows consistently over time. So solid underlying macro trends. And then you look at the company, Zoetis. Here's the company that's a market leader with a broad portfolio, very durable revenue streams and remember, from my experience at Warner Chilcott, we sort of had the opposite of the durable revenue streams. Everybody was always concerned. And I looked at this and said, \"Here's a company that has the opportunity to put consistent, revenue growth on the board by levering its broad portfolio and driving growth of those assets through application of sales force.\" It's very similar to what I was used to at Warner Chilcott, and also supporting those brands through productive R&D, both in terms of extending product life cycles, in terms of providing fuel to allow the sales forces to grow the overall revenue base and lastly, to add those truly innovative products that give you the opportunity to step up and accelerate your growth. So I look at this as being kind of a similar economic model to the pharma business, but with those important differences of longer duration, revenue streams, less reliance on IP. It's about the brands. Same levers to drive the business that's using your field sales resources, face-to-face with your customers to go out and drive revenue and then lastly, supporting that portfolio through productive investment in R&D. And I'd say that, that was my analysis coming in and 61 days later, I think this is a terrific company. And what I've been most impressed with is the ability of the company to execute consistently and drive revenue that exceeds the overall market growth. It's been quite an interesting couple of months here. And again, the most important thing was we've got a great team here that knows how to drive this business. I'll stop there. I'm sorry, you had a question about inventory in Japan. That was related to the termination of a distributor agreement. It's kind of a normal course. It came to the end and we were called upon to buy back some inventory, and that's what's going on there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Specifically on the outlook for gross margins. I mean, Paul, you talked about gross margins getting hit in the fourth quarter. I imagine that's largely due to FX. But in light of global pricing pressure, maybe, Juan, you can touch upon that in terms of what you are seeing across all your different geographies. But in light of that competitive dynamic, how do you see the outlook for gross margins? Do you think that gross margins can expand in 2015, in 2016? Or should we assume that pricing pressures would offset volume growth and cost cutting or slimming down the manufacturing. But if you could just talk to, number one, pricing, global pricing pressures; and number two, impact on gross margins? And the other question was -- to Paul, was there any channel loading in front of the new vaccine launches? And Paul, congratulations on what sounds like a terrific opportunity for you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Jami. And we see -- we continue seeing opportunities of applying price increases across all geographies in where we operate. Definitely in 2014, we had been increasing prices in the U.S., also in Europe, in Canada, Latin America and Asia Pacific. We also apply quite an aggressive approach in some markets with high inflation rates, and this is something that we have seeing a positive impact in our revenues also because of these price [indiscernible]. In terms of the expansion of gross margin, definitely, we'll have the opportunity to cover that in our Investor Day and we'll provide more details on what can be our objective for the future. And maybe I would like to delay this -- well, the details until this Investor Day. And maybe -- and the last comment on the channel loading. So we're not loading the channel and this is something that -- the vaccine launches will be next year. And normally, we apply a very strict procedures to avoid -- that we are increasing inventory that is not needed to meet customer demands.","Paul S. Herendeen","Jami, it's Paul. I think you had a question regarding Q4 margin and so I want to make sure I address that because it's an important point. It's an FX impact. Yes, there's FX impact in -- across all of our line items through our P&L. However, it's -- the main reason for the expected increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue in Q4 is related to the timing of increased headquarters cost, which are flowing through our cost of goods sold in the second half of 2014. And I wasn't here when the folks articulated that, but I think that they provided some guidance that you should expect the cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue to rise as the year went on. But that the guidance range, which is -- well, actually the guidance level, which is I think the important statistic is, we do expect to be in line with our guidance for the full year, which was 35.5%. I think broadly, looking ahead without providing guidance, I think we have the opportunity to absorb those increased HQ costs in 2015 and beyond without having it have a deleterious effect on our margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei of BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Regarding your Investor Day, you said that we're going to see some financial targets. I just want to clarify, are we going to -- are you going to provide some sort of medium to long-range guidance or targets beyond 2015? And the follow-up, there had been a lot of reports about potential buyers for your business. Obviously, in 2015 -- after June 2015, this will become more of a factor. Just could you comment on your overall strategic view about how relevant is that for you? How would you evaluate such opportunity? And just give us an overall sense of how you would think about that. Obviously, in the second half of next year, there's going to be a lot of focus on that. So how should we think about your position on potential -- on being a target of a potential acquisition?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay. Let me ask Paul to answer this question.","Paul S. Herendeen","Sure. I'll start with the Investor Day. We will provide a look, of course, what I'll call our normal sort of guidance look at 2015. And in addition, we will provide our thoughts around 2016 and 2017, not in the same level of detail, but in a way that would enable the market in large to get their arms around what our expectations are for the next several years. With respect to the second question?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And I think it's -- we cannot really respond on other company's strategy. We think we have a solid business that we can provide significant value to our shareholders. We are showing that we are meeting our objective in terms of revenues, in terms of adjusted net income and we are also, very important, growing faster than the market. So all this, in my opinion, is showing that this company is well managed. We also have a significant generation of cash over time, and then this will be additional opportunity for investors.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Paul, I think you said your first priority was to kind of focus on the stand-up activities. Can you just elaborate on what's still left to do on that front? And second question, I believe you guys have said previously that you expect about maybe 20 basis points of manufacturing cost headwind as we move into '15. Is that still a decent expectation?","Paul S. Herendeen","Sure, and it's Paul. First, the primary task that remains to be completed is the completion of the implementation of a global ERP system, where we're installing SAP. It's very important to us to have that backbone for our company to support our decision-making and the management of our business on a global basis, number one. It's also important to us because it's important that we stand on our own away from Pfizer. So that is a top priority for me now. And that it's not just the implementation, it's also the build-out of the team. We call it Business Technology, so BT, but obviously the more familiar IT acronym. We're continuing to build out that function here in headquarters to support our business. And so that is the primary area where we continue to have some work to stand alone, away and apart from Pfizer. Second, with respect to the manufacturing headwind, I mean, you'll recall that we have an agreement with -- a supply agreement with Pfizer, which has some increases in cost that we need to absorb. I think we're doing a good job of wringing efficiencies out of our manufacturing process that have enabled us to offset a solid part of those increases that are in that contract. We're not going to provide guidance today on what it looks like into 2015, but I'll just give you the factoids that you should keep in your head: We have the opportunity to pull the price lever; we have the opportunity to manage our global supply chain and drive better efficiency; and there's always a favorable mix to the extent that our higher-margin product lines provide more of our overall revenue base. So I would say, yes, we're always facing headwinds -- or we are facing some headwinds looking into '15, but those are challenges that we have a solid opportunity to overcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Louise Chen of Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I have a few. So first question for Paul is since you've joined Zoetis, what are some new initiatives that you plan to implement at the company that could help drive earnings well above the sort of the $2 per share mark? And then secondly, as a company, do you have any interest in companion animal oncology or biologic drugs? As you know, a lot of smaller companies develop these products. I'm just wondering if that's true -- truly good opportunity or not. And then lastly just on APOQUEL, is there any way you can quantify what sales would've been in '14 had you had enough supply? And then in '15, how should we think about the sales ramp? I know you had said $200 million to $300 million in peak sales over, normally, a 5-year time frame, but could you get there faster?","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, thanks, Louise. It's Paul. I'll take the first part of that. New initiatives to drive growth. Let's say the new initiatives, I get to step behind others who are already activating those sorts of strategies in order to drive longer-term growth, but as -- just referencing back to my past life, the similar sorts of levers that you would expect me to pull, and those include focus on value-generative business development activity. That would include using our existing tax structure to manage that tax rate in a downward direction. I think the things that I focus on also are the active management of our capital structure and thinking about ways that we can deliver value to our stakeholders really across-the-board, both from operations and from the management of our cap structure. So those are the initiatives that I've had. And then the second question was in companion animal?","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just curious if you think the oncology or biologics opportunities that some of the smaller companies are pursuing are actually real opportunities. Because I haven't seen the larger companies go after that, so just kind of curious.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","I would take this question and let me say that in oncology, Zoetis was the first company launching a product that was fully developed to treat cancer for dogs. And this product was Palladia that we launched 2 or 3 years ago. So within that oncology, it's important in companion animal. It's, today, in many cases, veterinarians are still using products developed for human to treat cancer in dogs or cats. But we think that in the future, maybe there will be new products that will be better targeted for treating these kind of diseases in companion animal. And definitely, we will be assessing these opportunity and considering the internal or external opportunities to complement our portfolio. In terms of bios, I think it has been a key area for Zoetis. We have a very strong portfolio in both companion animal and livestock and we'll continue investing in bringing new products to our portfolio and also to strengthening our offer to our customers. And then finally on APOQUEL, so in 2014, we have communicated that our revenues will be around 1% of our total revenues and this has been because of the limitations in terms of product supply. Speculating how much will be the sales of APOQUEL with -- under restricted supply probably is not adding too much value. So what I think, in my opinion, it's -- important is that for 2015, we expect to generate more than $100 million in revenues and we expect definitely to generate these revenues, basically on that 9 months of full supply because we expect to have this product available to more customers from April. So you can -- that's why we are now communicating that we expect that this product has the potential of $200 million to $300 million at peak sales.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to start, I think I'm trying to understand and I've got some questions trying to understand sort of the sequential guidance in terms of revenue. Obviously, they were really strong this last quarter. If I look at your historical seasonality, 4Q seems to be up a little -- to be up pretty meaningfully from 3Q. So just understanding some of those dynamics, as we move into the fourth quarter, that we should be aware of. And certainly the FX guidance seems to be a little bit more extreme than I would've expected. And then the other question is on terms of the PEDv vaccine. Just perhaps you can provide some perspective on how big an opportunity that can be for you and sort of the timing of that sort of coming -- or sort of the revenue sort of building on that product line because, obviously, very impressive how quickly you were able to get a product approved and to market.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, it's Paul. I'll take the fourth quarter. And how do you get there? I mean, we have 3 quarters on the board. So the year-to-date number is on the board. We have guidance. You can do the math and see what it implies with respect to revenue growth in the fourth quarter that's implied by that. Midpoint of the range, it's -- from a reported basis, it's sort of flattish and we did state that there's about a 250- to 300-basis-point negative impact to our revenues in Q4 versus Q4 of 2013. So fairly significant FX headwinds. And it does give me the opportunity to say, look, we feel like, from an operational perspective, we have a very strong quarter here and very strong guidance for the full year and that's pretty good when you're facing those sorts of FX headwinds that will -- almost certainly, in fact, I would say certainly will hit us in Q4 '14 compared back to '13. And frankly, as you think ahead to 2015 v '14 you have got to take this into account. For perspective, 45% of our revenue comes from our U.S. So we're U.S. dollar denominated, we're exposed to the euro, the real, Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, sterling, yen. From the perspective of a U.S. dollar-denominated P&L, all those currencies I mentioned, there's not a lot of good news. There's a lot of headwind there. So we feel like our guidance for the full year and our guidance for Q4 is pretty strong, given that we're facing those headwinds going into -- or going into Q4. I think I'll leave it at that and Juan Ram\u00f3n?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And I will answer the question on PEDv. And so just to provide a little bit of understanding of the market's potential. So first, this vaccine, it's targeting sows. And then by vaccinating the sows, it's transmitting the immunity to the piglet. So the number of sows in the U.S. is a little bit less of 6 million compared to 100 million of pigs of the total market. You see that the potential is related to the number of animals that will get this vaccine. That will be less than 6 million. The second fact that is also important is that we obtained a conditional license. Under the conditional license, we have some limitations in terms of the promotions. Actually, we can go to the customers and work with them to ensure protection for the sow, but there are some limitations in terms of promotion. What is important here is not the size of the revenues, but the confirmation that our business model is working very well. We have very strong capabilities in terms of R&D. Also, we have very strong capabilities in terms of our manufacturing to produce vaccine in a way that it's going to the market very fast. So in our opinion, we are bringing with this vaccine significant value to our customers, that they are facing a significant challenge with this disease, and we are confirming that Zoetis has all the capabilities that are needed to succeed in this industry.","Paul S. Herendeen","Sorry, it's Paul. I just do want to follow up. The one thing that I didn't say in my remarks about Q4 is also take a look at the quarter you're comparing to back in 2013. Our Q4 was quite strong. If you look at Q -- if you go back to '13 and you look sequentially, Q3 of '13 like $1.1 billion, Q4 '13 $1.254 billion, I think it was -- I've got -- yes, it was a little over $1.2 billion. And so, one is comparing back to last year's Q3, that certainly helped us in putting our good quarter on the board here in Q3 of '14. But that's a tough comparison quarter, Q4 of '13.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And so, Paul, just to clarify, so you don't think that necessarily that step-up of $115 million sequentially is sort of like a normal seasonal trend that we should think about?","Paul S. Herendeen","From '13 -- what I'd say is, I want to make this point over and over and over again, is because of the nature of our business and seasonality and how things can shift from September to October or across the month, the best way to look at it is the longest time period that you're comfortable with whether that's a year, a half year, whatever. If you look at the second half of 2014 versus '13, it's a good, solid second half of '14.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum of Evercore ISI.","Vlad Nikolenko","It's actually Vlad Nikolenko sitting in for Mark Schoenebaum. And so the question -- sorry for maybe beating a dead horse. But the question about the Q4, the current full year guidance implies that from Q3 to Q4 of this year, so year -- quarter-by-quarter growth, it's probably going to be a down quarter for revenue and for EPS. So I'm wondering if you can explain that in terms of expenses, what happens in Q4. Is it just seasonal stuff or something else? And in terms of revenue, I understand there will be a huge FX impact, but also just for FX, just to understand how it works for our models, I'm wondering if you can give more color about the type of hedging Zoetis is using for -- both for revenue, for the plan, as well as for EPS.","Paul S. Herendeen","Okay. Let me -- stay with me here because I want to make sure I understand your question. I think you started by asking about sequentially from Q3 of '14 into Q4 of '14. If you take the midpoint of our range, it would be up in Q4 versus Q3. Okay. So sequentially, I mean, at the midpoint of our range, you would have an increase in revenue Q3 '14 into Q4 '14. The other thing to point out is we talked about the impact in the quarter of the increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue, the implied is in the -- is going to be a high percentage and we called that out even in my prepared remarks. So you've got that. Then within SG&A, we typically do spend more towards the back half of the year. That's been a historically observed phenomenon within our business. And certainly within R&D, there is seasonality in our spend there and we talk about sort of the timing of trials that we can do in the field. You need the right conditions in order to be able to do that and the timing of projects, generally, ours have seemed to cluster and have us with more expense in R&D in Q4. You put all of those things together, yes, and then looking at Q4 on a stand-alone basis, yes, you could say, \"Well, gee, the -- against whatever comparator you want to have, whether it's Q3 of '14 or Q4 of '13, it's a tough comparison.\" Again, strong full year expectation for the company. You were looking for reported growth in the neighborhood of 3% to 4% at the top line and that's on an operating basis taking FX out of the mix. Now this is revenue, expecting 5% to 6%. Think of that reported 3% to 4% range as -- but for FX, that's 5% to 6%, which is a very solid full year revenue growth '14 v '13. And I'm sorry, the second question?","Vlad Nikolenko","And the second question about the hedging. What type of hedging do you guys use to hedge top line and bottom line, if you do. Hedging instruments, if you're using specific instruments or rely on sort of natural hedging. And if there is natural hedging between regions, what is the delay between -- when the dollar moves or currencies move and the impact that we can see?","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, a couple of things. I mean, we have natural hedges built in to markets where we have a significant presence because, of course, our costs are denominated in the same currency as our revenue streams. We do not hedge our top line nor our bottom line results. Like most companies, we don't. We are subject to, what they -- the changes in exchange rates. And frankly, if you look at them, again, my favorite phrase, over a long enough period of time, you'll see that those things sort of set -- sort themselves out. Where we do hedge is our net asset exposures in our subsidiaries. So that to the extent that we have risk when those balance sheets are translated, that we can hedge that and keep those costs within a relatively narrow band. We do, do that. Those costs as well as the FX gains or losses, would show up in our other income and deductions line within our P&L.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I have, first, some questions for Juan Ram\u00f3n and then for Paul. So Juan Ram\u00f3n, first, could you just talk about animals moving into feed lots sooner in a little bit more detail on -- specifically what I'm hoping for you to address is how durable that is. So for how many quarters will that be benefiting Zoetis? Second, you've mentioned the APOQUEL revenue for '15 being over $100 million. Could you just help us benchmark that by providing a framework for what revenue you're going to be booking in 2014 for APOQUEL? And then third, for the PEDv vaccine. You mentioned 6 million sows is the opportunity. Could you just tell us the price of the vaccine? And I think it's given twice a year, but just remind us about that as well.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Dave. And you are correct, it's 2x per year, maybe the first time, it's -- it can be an opportunity of 3 vaccines, but then the following years would be 2x. And the price of the PEDv vaccine, it's $7 -- about $7. The treatment choice, 3.5 each vaccine. In terms of APOQUEL for 2014, so we communicated that will be around 1% of our revenue. Our revenue, it's $4.5 billion or $4.7 billion. So we expect that we'll be around $40 million in terms of revenues. And this is only limited because of the supply availability. And then talking about the movement of animals and how long this movement will stay? Well, it depends on the price of the grain. So if the price of the grains are low, so the incentive of moving animals and keeping these animals in the feed lot with significant gains in terms of weight, I think, it will be an opportunity for maintaining this current situation. What we saw in 2014 is even the number of animals moving to the feed lot, maybe it will be slightly lower than the 2013 because they are less animals because they are keeping animals. Also to rebuild the herd, they have been moving animals at a younger age, which are lighter, more vulnerable to infections, more needs of vaccinations. And this has been having a positive impact in our revenues. We expect this situation of younger animals move to the feed lots will stay in the future, in 2015, because the price of feeding the animals remains very low and the profitability and the value of these animals is very high.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That's great. And Paul, congrats again. My couple of questions for you are, first, when do you expect to get through the standup costs? Second, what is the FX hit to EPS that you're expecting in the fourth quarter? And then third, if the R&D tax credit is passed, what will the benefit be in the fourth quarter?","Paul S. Herendeen","Okay. In -- 2 out of the 3, I can answer. Thanks, David. Well, that question about when we'll be through the standup cost, I would expect to be substantially complete towards the latter part of 2015. Let's say, the end of 2015. We will continue to be flipping switches on our ERP implementation into 2016, but the lion share of the costs should be behind us after the year end 2015. The FX impact on -- at the net income line implied for Q4 is in the range of 100 to 150 basis points negative. And then the last question about the R&D credit in Q4, if it were to be passed, it will have an impact of approximately 50 basis points to the full year rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Holford of Jefferies.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I've got 2 for Paul, please. Firstly just on APOQUEL, just trying to think about contribution margins of this product as it gets towards the peak of $200 million to $300 million, which you just guided. I would assume that this is a very high margin product relative to the rest of the business, something more like a pharmaceutical contribution margin, probably -- possibly 50%, 60% or higher in terms of the operating level, if you can comment around that. And then just secondly, could you tell us if Zoetis has any kind of poison pill type measures as bid defenses? And if not, is the company intending to introduce these into 2015?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","I couldn't get the second question. So it's...","Paul S. Herendeen","I'll get the second.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So let me answer the APOQUEL. So our gross margin, has risen to 65%. And we communicated that companion animal has the highest margins in our total portfolio, followed by cattle, then swine and the lowest is poultry. So even if we have not provided details of each species, you can extrapolate that with the 65% that companion animal, being the highest, it's -- APOQUEL has a good margin. And in terms of how much we need to invest to support these product launches. So what we said is that we have the infrastructure to support the promotional activities of any new products. And maybe in some cases, we need also to support this approach probably some additional advertising and promotion. But in our opinion, in the case of APOQUEL, the reaction of the market has been so positive that we don't think that we'll require any significant additional investment to support the objective that we have set for 2015 and also the long-term objective of $200 million to $300 million peak sales. And then Paul will answer the question on the poison pill.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes. Yes, I'll answer the question by saying, with respect to your specific question around poison pill, no comment on that specifically. However, what I would say is, we're a public company. We're for sale every day and to the extend that someone were to come in and be interested and think they could do a better job with our collection of assets, there's certainly the opportunity for them to express that. What I would report back though is, we think we're the team to run this company. We're driving value for our shareholders. We're doing that by pulling all of the levers at our disposal which includes being maniacal about deploying capital both inside and, hopefully, outside of our business. And at the end of the day, if we deliver value, that's what we rely on to continue to be the fellows and ladies that run this company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wilson of Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Livestock growth was impressive. Can you break out what was attributable to volume, price and new products, such as the beta agonists? How sustainable kind of is that growth? And also with consolidating competitors, there could also be some opportunities to potentially fill some holes in your portfolio. What are areas that you would find particularly interesting for you, any specific therapeutic category?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, we, in my opinion -- thank you, Erin, for the question. I think, in my opinion, we have a very strong portfolio. I believe that, that is the strongest portfolio in the animal health industry. We have always opportunities to fill some gaps, but we don't have a strategic need to really cover areas, which are important for animal health, which are not part of our portfolio. We are very strong in vaccines. We are very strong in parasiticide. We are strong in also other therapeutic areas and definitely we'll be always assessing opportunities to add more products to our portfolio. But because we think that we have the infrastructure and we have the opportunity to achieve synergies in both revenues and also in terms of costs, by adding products or adding assets of our company, but not because we have a strategic need to fill any area where we feel that we are -- or represent a significant gap in our business. And in terms of the livestock growth, definitely it has been very strong growth. Volume has been the most important part of the growth. And price, we also mentioned that the price is in line with the industry. The industry in terms of price is growing around 3% and this is consistent with our growth in terms of price. So all the rest has been volume, so very strong performance in terms of volume. That is also the result of excellent portfolio and also excellent execution from our teams to bring this as well to the market.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And as it relates to QUEL and the competing drug for Rimadyl, are there relationships with distributors that you could establish there and -- that would potentially help to win the competition there? And how big is opportunity for Versican? And is there an opportunity for that in the U.S.?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So we definitely partner with distributors that are also helping us to reach customers that we are not calling directly to our field force. And this partnership is working very well and I think it's something we are happy with the declaration that we are having with distributors. And we will continue really providing to them the products and also the kind of support that they need also to promote the products to customers that we are not directly targeting through our direct model.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So thank you very much for joining today's call. And I'm looking forward to see you on November 18 in New York at the New York Stock Exchange, in where we'll have the opportunity to go into more details of our business model and also more details on our guidance for 2015 and also for the period of '15, '17.

Welcome to our earnings call. I\u2019ll share highlights of the progress Zoetis is making now that we\u2019re a fully independent company but to start let me go right to the numbers. I\u2019m very pleased with our 4% operational revenue growth and diluted EPS of $0.36. I believe this performance further illustrating the continuous strength of our company and what we\u2019re creating.","I\u2019ll now share some of the highlights of these results and then Rick Passov our Chief Financial Officer will provide further details of our performance. So first to the results, in Asia-Pacific the drought conditions impacted our livestock business in Australia and New Zealand. While we\u2019ve seen growth in Asia markets. In Canada, Latin America we saw positive growth driven by a companion animals in Brazil and Mexico and we also saw growth in our swine business across the region.","In Europe, Africa, Middle-East, the performance in the Western Europe continue to be affected by a tough economic conditions and along cold winter that impacted the parasitic campaign for companion animals and also cattle. Our poultry and swine business has performed well during this quarter in this region. And finally in the U.S. we continue to see a good momentum. Driven by a companion animal poultry and swine, we also have seen recovery in our cattle business based on the improvements on the 2012 drought conditions.","In terms of species and on operational basis companion animal are livestock both contributed to the 4% second quarter growth in revenues. We saw operational growth of 5% in companion animal largely driven by the performance in the U.S. and major markets and operational growth of 3% in livestock driven by swine and poultry. While weather conditions and economic challenges in certain countries were a factor in our overall results, the financial performance for the quarter continues to demonstrate how our global scale, local producers (ph) and diverse portfolio can help us deliver steady revenue growth across the year. With all these factors we reaffirm our full year guidance for 2015.","Economic and business are related factors for some of our customers are improving. For example we\u2019re excited to see some encouraging signs of the easing of the drought impact in the U.S. With the price of the pork now lower than in 2012 we anticipate that positive evolution in the livestock industry. We expect to see the impacts of this improvement over the second half of the year and for the market to start to return to pre-drought activity in the coming 12 weeks (ph).","We\u2019re also aware of new factors which are emerging and negatively impacting our customers. Swine produces in the U.S. are experiencing an outbreak on the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus. A similar virus impacted the swine industry in China in 2012. We\u2019re committed to support the U.S. pork producers in standing and controlling PEDV and we\u2019re partnering with the stakeholders including a various academic institutions such as the University of Minnesota (ph).","The performance of this quarter has been achieved while we\u2019ve been working through many of the challenges of becoming independent. Since our last call Zoetis formerly separated from Pfizer. The separation was officially completed as of June 24, generating a significant number of new investors in our company. This operation was also the culmination of two years journey to create the world\u2019s largest independent company solely catered at animal health.","And while Pfizer continues to provide a number of services to our business to a range of transitional service agreement and (inaudible) manufacturing and supply agreement, we\u2019re actively building resources we need to operate on our own and at a cost base that is appropriated for our business. We\u2019re equipping Zoetis with a right size infrastructure to meet our global business needs, for example we\u2019re making progress on the implementation of our own global share services and our HRA systems. We also relocated our global headquarters and in doing so reduced the cost associated with these office space.","I\u2019m proud of what the team has achieved and the way in which we\u2019re managing the recent transitions with appropriate levels of rigor and discipline and I\u2019m particularly proud that through all this work we\u2019ve remained focus on keeping our commitments to our customers.","We continue strengthening our business model, with this commitment to our customers and also through innovation, for example in April of this year we launched an e-commerce site for our U.S. customers. The new shopping site enables our customers to order process they need directly from Zoetis 24\/7. We have seen strong customer feedback on the convenience and performance of the site and a steady increase in volumes through these channels.","As of the end of the July we have more than 3250 U.S. base customer register and more than 2700 of them have already ordered through the site. We continue to make progress on bringing innovation to marketers through new products and the productive life cycle management of our existing brands. In this quarter there are many examples of this approach and I\u2019m please to share with you some of these.","All our, the outcome of the process that delivers strong results and continues to deliver innovation for our customers and in the animal health industry. We make our strategic investments in research and development based on four criteria, strategic fit and important to our current portfolio. Technical accessibility of development and manufacturer. Return on investment and the need of customers and the market, colleagues in commercial manufacturing and R&D work together to ensure that all needs are considered in our investment decisions. This approach provides sustainable productivity and enable us to deliver an industry leading portfolio, for example an investment decision we made six years ago was to develop a noble product. We have first in class (inaudible) of action.","This product is APOQUEL. The U.S. FDA approved these asset in May of this year and in July European Committee for veterinary medicinal products or CVMP adopted a positive opinion recommended the granting of a market authorization for APOQUEL. This represents an important step in the produce approval process in the European Union. APOQUEL is indicated for a console of pruritus associated with allergic dermatitis and a control of atopic dermatitis index who are (inaudible) pruritus or itching is the most common sign of allergies index. Developed by Zoetis researchers APOQUEL is the first Janus kinase inhibitor approved for veterinary use that target the itch and inflammation pathway and also provide fast acting relief, (inaudible) there are an estimated 8.2 million dogs that suffer from short or long term allergic skin conditions.","We understand that these are serious issues for dogs and very frustrating and distressing issue for pet owners. APOQUEL was recently the topic of a symposium at the American Veterinary Medical Association Annual Meeting. The reaction we saw from the veterinarian was very encouraging and there was a lot of engaging discussions about the product and the very real benefit it will bring once they launch.","We\u2019re not only investing in industry leading that research but also in the life cycle management of our existing portfolio. This enable us to achieve the greatest value for both Zoetis and for our customers. For example in this quarter BOVI-SHIELD GOLD ONE SHOT a vaccine for cattle who help prevent respiratory diseases was approved in July for the U.S. market. Life cycle investment over the past 30 years (inaudible) have contributed.","A significant percentage of the total revenues for the BOVI-SHIELD product growth. (Inaudible) secured a meaningful claim extension in Japan making the product available to protect (inaudible), DRAXXIN 25 injectable solution and anti-infective are really used in cattle and swine was approved in the U.S. at the new lower concentration that is more suitable for pigs. Again our commitment to grant license management with this franchise has contributed a meaningful percentage to total DRAXXIN revenues over the years.","And we have successfully registered pull back IVQX in a number of new markets this quarter including Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and South Africa. This vaccine was first approved in France in 2010 and this indicated to reduce respiratory infections in pork. And finally I\u2019m pleased to confirm an important milestone with our joint venture in China. July saw the approval for RUI LAN AN a new high standard of innovation against a highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The vaccine combines the global expertise of Zoetis and a strong local vaccine and developmental program to address the needs of swine produces in China. They have also leading the pork production nation.","Each of these examples further demonstrate our ability to leverage the three core interconnected capabilities of Zoetis. Our direct sales and marketing model, our leadership in product research and development and high quality produces and rely on supply. So as we look ahead we remain confident in our ability to demonstrate profitable growth and now as a full independent company. I\u2019m excited about the opportunities and also the challenge that lie ahead and I know we\u2019re prepared for them. With that let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis and I will now hand the call over to Rick and ask him to walk us through the financial results.","Rick Passov","","Thank you Juan Ram\u00f3n, as you mentioned we\u2019ve become a fully independent company since the last earnings call and with more than 400 million shares exchanged in the Pfizer offer we have many new shareholders in Zoetis and hopefully many of you are joining us today. This is just our second earnings call so let me take a minute to recap the basis of how we will be presenting our financials before we get into the results. While the results are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP our commentary will largely speak to financial results on an adjusted basis these adjusted figures including adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures, they exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition related costs and certain significant item such as the non-recurring cost are becoming stand-alone public company. We also sight operational results these figures exclude the impact of foreign exchange and demonstrate the underlying performance of our business. Operational results are used by management to evaluate the business and we believe that providing these use of our performance we will enhance your understanding of our financial results.","And in addition to the company\u2019s overall income statement our financial reports and discussion also reflect how we manage our business on a regional basis as you can see in the tables accompanying our press release we provide revenue and pretax earnings for our four regional operating segments as well as our consolidated results. We also provide supplemental revenue breakdowns by livestock and companion animal categories for the regions to provide additional insight into our quarterly and year-to-date results. And as you know Zoetis was not a standalone company in 2012 so our financial statements for 2012 in prior years in our public fillings happen to heighten the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer. These include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs that we\u2019re true to the animal health business at Pfizer and as we noted the combined financial statements for 2012 do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a standalone company.","As a result this can make comparisons to the prior year difficult in certain instances. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter now, revenue was approximately $1.114 billion and increase of approximately 2% year-over-year including a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign exchange, excluding this FX impact revenue grew 4% and I\u2019ll discuss the key drivers in a minute.","Let me turn to net income, reported net income of a $128 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.26 both decreased by approximately 26%, this decrease was primarily driven by certain standup cost associated with a full separation from Pfizer as well as a non-recurring onetime benefit in the year ago quarter related to our allocated portion of our Pfizer tax settlement. On an adjusted basis net income of a $178 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.36 showed an increase of approximately 1% and 3% respectively. The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $9 million of purchase accounting adjustments, $6 million of acquisition related costs and $35 million of certain significant items.","Turning now to our adjusted net income statement revenue was up about 4% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 35.9% of revenues versus approximately 34.9% in the year ago quarter. Cost of sales was negatively impacted by approximately 50 basis points related to increased sales associated with certain third party manufacturing agreements. These agreements are related to mandated divestures from prior acquisitions and the sales are reported in our Europe, APME, Middle-East segment.","Adjusted SG&A and R&D expenses decreased operationally 2% and 1% respective. Adjusted interest expense was $32 million in the second quarter of 2013 a significant increase from the year ago reflecting our debt assurance in January of this year. Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter decreased to income of $3 million in the second quarter of 2013 from income of $7 million in the second quarter of 2012, our effective adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 29.4% and our adjusted net income increased approximately 1% to a $178 million for the second quarter.","On to our segment results which I would discuss on an operational basis. Segment earnings are pretax numbers and are being reported on a adjusted basis as I described earlier. Beginning with the U.S. second quarter revenue is $437 million an increase of 4%. Livestock revenue growth in the U.S. was 6%; growth was achieved across all species with contributions from cattle, swine and poultry products. Sales of cattle products returned to growth this quarter primarily based on the favorable impact of annual price increases taken in the first quarter of 2013 while volume was relatively flat reflecting the continued impact of last year\u2019s drought.","Meanwhile sales of swine and poultry products grew at a faster rates than cattle due largely to continued customer acceptance of new products and targeted marketing programs. Companion animal revenue growth was driven by a combination of annual price increases and marketing programs which were partially offset by the favorable impact of weather in the year ago quarter and the return of a competing product to the market.","U.S. segment earnings increased by 12% due to revenue growth, product mix and operational efficiencies. In EuAfME, second quarter results were $278 million an increase of approximately 1% operationally. As we expected second quarter sales in EuAfME were impacted by the unseasonably cold spring weather which delayed the start of the parasiticide season for both livestock and companion animal products. Livestock revenue in EuAfME declined 2% operationally rightfully due to the clients in cattle and sheep products which offset growth in swine and poultry. Companion animal revenue grew 6% operationally this growth however was largely driven by the third party manufacturing sales I mentioned earlier without these sales underlying companion animal product sales were relatively flat and the timing of price increases year-over-year which had a positive impact in the first quarter of 2013 resulted in a negative impact in the second quarter due to purchases being made in the events of price increases.","And then overall market conditions primarily in seven year remain challenging due to continued weak economic environment. And finally EuAfME segment earnings increased 1% operationally based on lower expenses in the third quarter. In CLAR, second quarter sales were 213 million an increase of approximately 4% operationally. Livestock revenue growth grew 4% operationally driven by swine and poultry products while cattle product sales declined primarily in Brazil. Companion animal revenue grew 6% operationally driven by increased demand and successful marketing programs in Brazil and Mexico partially offset by the favorable impact in Canada of a competitive supply issue in the year ago quarter.","CLAR segment revenue, CLAR segment earnings increased by 7% operationally. This increases was primarily driven by revenue growth while expenses were relatively flat. In APAC second quarter sales were a 186 million, an increase of 7% operationally. Livestock revenue grew 5% operationally driven primarily by higher demand and the continued acceptance of new swine products. This growth was achieved despite challenging market conditions for pork producers in Southeast Asia.","Companion animal revenue grew 13% operationally due to the increased penetration of key brands as well as the successful launch of new products in the region. APAC segment operating earnings increased 11% operationally this reflects revenue growth in flat operating expenses which were partially offset by unfavorable mix.","Now let us turn to guidance for full year 2013. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the financial guidance and are reaffirming all aspects of our 2013 financial guidance for the full year which calls for just EPS of between a $1.36 and a $1.42 per share.","As part of certain significant items we continue to expect non-recurring cost largely related to standing up the company between approximately $200 million and $240 million in 2013 which will be excluded from adjusted numbers. A reaffirmation of our guidance for onetime cost of $200 million to $240 million includes two largely offsetting items in the second quarter.","First is noted in our prior filings the completion of our separation from Pfizer triggered the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards generating an additional expense of $31 million in the quarter. In addition of this quarter we have changed our restructuring plan that have been reserved for in 2012 while we were part of Pfizer. The reversal of this reserve of $27 million was accounted for as part of the restructuring charges related to our non-recurring costs. Due to evolving local requirements we believe we can achieve our objectives in a more cost efficient manner. As a result of these two offsetting items our guidance for non-recurring costs also remains unchanged. So including all of these items our reported diluted EPS for the full year is expected to be between $1 to a $1.06 per share.","While our quarterly results are subject to variability related weather patterns and herd management decisions among other things our annual guidance reflects a confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.","That concludes my prepared remarks and now we will open the line for questions. Dina?","Dina Fede ","Operator we\u2019re ready for our first question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Anne Wilson - Bank of America","","Hi, this is Anne Wilson in for Bob today. My first question is on SG&A what were the key factors I guess it's (inaudible) to the SG&A margin leverage in the quarter and how should we think about I guess the quarterly progression of administrative expenses in the second half and near term cost structuring initiatives now that you\u2019re separate or officially separate from Pfizer.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","So we define our expenses based on marketable committees and also the activities that we think that are needed to support our revenues. That\u2019s why in these second quarter you saw some decline of expenses but is the result of really identify the opportunities that we need to really maximize during the quarter and then allocate the resources based on these opportunities. Maybe Rick you can expand on some additional comments.","Rick Passov","Sure, first of all and thank you for the question. A couple of things to note in our expenses to-date there are a couple of what I would call program changes as we went into 2013 to lower compensation and other costs as a percent of revenue and you will see the benefit of that throughout the year. In addition as one Ram\u00f3n said there has been good expense control into this year and also spend on advertising and promotional campaigns not occurring as a result for example of the parasiticide season in Europe being delayed. And then finally for the second half of the year we expect the same seasonality in our expenses as a percent of revenue in 2013 that you saw in 2012 aside from some carve out anomalies particularly in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Dina Fede","","Next question please.","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Louise Chen \u2013 Guggenheim","","I was curious as to if you could give more color on when you will expect recovery for your cattle sales and what do you incorporated into your 2013 guidance for that. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","And definitely we anticipated that in 2013 we will see the impact of the drought, the drought has been having lower impact than expected in poultry and swine and cattle is inline with the industry expectations and sure for the growth impact. Positive signs on the cattle industry is that the price of the grain and especially the corn is now much lower than in 2012 and also projected to be lower in the last part of the year. So this is a good indicator that we will see significant movement of animals from pasture to (inaudible) large and this will increase the opportunities for animal health care products.","So we see that the recovery of cattle will be happening in the second half, definitely the number of animals it's lower than in 2012 but at the same time because of the price of beef is still positive the value of these animals also is higher we expect that the producers will invest really to keep these animals healthy and productive.","Rick Passov","I\u2019ll just add two points to that, with respect to your comment on this has baked into our guidance, I\u2019ll just point out that Q3 of 2012 was the quarter where we really experienced the impact of the drought especially in the cattle market and so in Q3 of 2013 we are expecting relatively good growth quarter-over-quarter and then in Q4 of 2012 you saw I don\u2019t want to say an anomaly but the decisions that livestock producers are making to call herds made Q4 relatively a good quarter for us so if you balance those two things across 2012 and compare them to 2013 that\u2019s included in our guidance that we\u2019re reaffirming today.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Yes, this comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chris Schott \u2013 JPMorgan","Just a bigger picture question here, you\u2019re seeing some nice leverage in your P&L over the past few years, as we think about the longer term model for Zoetis is there any reason we should anticipate that your margin progression or improvement slows, we\u2019re going to stabilize this at any point in the next few years if in fact the company is able to let\u2019s say grow inline with a mid-single digit type of top-line growth or maybe see more broadly for the industry.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Well we have provided guidance for 2013, we have not provided yet guidance for 2014 definitely we will provide at the end of the year these guidance. So in 2013 the guidance that we\u2019re providing is showing a significant improvement in our margins and we are convinced that the price leverage we will have a positive impact in our growth margin, our efforts in attempts of being more efficient and for our manufacturing also have positive impact and the discipline in managing our expenses and going by our expenses lower than our revenues. We have a positive impact in our earnings per share. So in summary we\u2019re convinced that we have the elements to make products in terms of margin and we will provide guidance for 2014 at the end of the year.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Absolutely. This will be from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","","I guess could you may be talk about capital allocation and potentially what you guys could be looking at on the acquisition front and then I was also wondering if you could also mention what\u2019s driving that weakness in Equine and when you expect that to recover?","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Let me answer this question in general and maybe Rick will provide some of these from other comment. So in the next couple of years we will be funding a certain onetime cost which are related to a standing up (inaudible) company including new systems, including the infrastructure also including the separation of our some plants that were also co-located with Pfizer. We also have some obligations in terms of our debt, these debt it's come in due between 2015 and 2018 for more than $1 billion that really after all these couple of years or three years will be a really discussing that what will be the allocation of capital. That\u2019s really in terms of long term we will follow a prudent cash management philosophy to assure that we meet our commitments and also we balance the needs of our key shareholders.","We expect to be a company that strikes the right debt balance when allocating that capital for long term growth and returning cash to investors. Rick maybe some additional comments on the onetime cost or maybe the debt situation.","Rick Passov","Well I think Kevin you also asked about the Equine? So the only thing I would add to the point one Ram\u00f3n made is just to say that yes after we get through a period of elevated cost we would like to be a company that demonstrates very strong capital discipline in how we allocate capital. And the Equine market we\u2019re seeing couple of factors first of all in Canada very significant slowdown in Equine sales due to perhaps a cyclical or maybe a longer term impact in the horse-racing industry, economic and similar factors also impacting on sales on the U.S. and generally in few other regions as well. So, it's a profitable business for us but we\u2019re certainly watching what happens in that market to understand the permanence of some of the trends that we\u2019re seeing now.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Yes, this will be Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeff Holford - Jefferies","So now that you\u2019re separate from Pfizer are you able to comment a bit more about 2015 and some of the service agreements and step-ups for the (inaudible) just how you\u2019re thinking about how you might be able to mitigate some of those increases in charge kind of those agreements? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","I guess that you\u2019re relating to the service that we have up for manufacturing?","Jeff Holford \u2013 Jefferies","On manufacturing, SG&A and R&D I think there is some levels particularly in manufacturing.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Okay let\u2019s then focus on manufacturing, so the manufacturing we\u2019ve agreement there for which Pfizer is producing for us certain products at cost for the next two years from the separation. After these two years their aim is also including a margin increase of 15% and these at the time of the separation we also evaluated about 30 million, the team has been already working on reducing these 30 million and I\u2019m pleased to see that this amount has been reduced by half already and we\u2019re working at really to reduce even further before 2015. So you see that is something that we\u2019re working hard really to minimize the impact and the impact has already reduced significantly.","Rick Passov","And maybe I will just comment on some of the areas, the other areas that you mentioned. On R&D, R&D has been standalone in animal health since about 2003. I mean I think that the majority of the relatively small amount of transitional services that Pfizer was providing to the animal health organization are pretty much behind us and on SG&A there is a good amount of work, a significant amount of work that remains to move us to our own transaction or financial service organizations as well as to move us off of the IT, the information technology services that Pfizer is providing to us. I mean that will be generally complete by the end of 2015 for the IT services and generally by mid to late 2014 for transaction finance services.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Absolutely. This is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","First on the U.S. companion animal business, it appears a bit slower than we expected I think only 2% operational growth. I was wondering if you can comment on that further and whether it was related to the entry of the competitive product and your outlook for that business and if a follow-up if I may how much improvement do you see in manufacturing and could you comment on your longer term product mix expectations. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","I will answer the first question and then Rick will answer the improvement in manufacturing. In companion animal I will describe that in the second quarter we had two impacts, the most important one was related to the cold weather and we already described these cold weather also effecting Europe companion animal parasiticide campaign. The cold weather also in the U.S. delayed the implementation of parasiticide products to protect animals against ticks and fleas and this had an impact in our companion animal segment. We also saw that our competitor was back to the market and for our closed revolution (ph) these had an impact on the dog segment although on the feline segment the impact was insignificant. So overall I think with the performance of the companion animal has been in our opinion positive and we expect also that in the second half of the year will remain positive evolution. The companion animal we have seen that the number of adoptions it's inline with expectations, we also have seen that the number of visitor to clinics it's growing and also the amount that pet owners are spending on animals is also increasing. So all these indicators are providing are good projections for the second half of the year.","Rick Passov","On your question on manufacturing and our outlook going forward, I will just say a couple of things, there is good progression from Q1 to Q2 but I think that shows good continuous improvement, good cost containment, we continue to outlook opportunities to increase the load on our network as we make decisions on how we will transition product made for us by Pfizer today either to a third party manufacturer or to ourselves and then it's these capabilities that we\u2019re demonstrating now that will apply to our long term goals beyond 2015 which we haven't numerated at this point.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liav Abraham of Citi.","Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi","","Just a question on the Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus that has recently emerged in the U.S. Can you comment on your exposure to swine within your U.S. livestock revenues and whether you anticipate the impact of this virus to have any, to be material at all on your U.S. livestock business in 2013? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Definitely these PEDV outrage is concerning situation for many of our producers. There are a couple of elements which are important to understand that from these, so first it's not effective the (inaudible) it's affecting only the piglets and second there is no known food safety issue that also can be a concern from consumer. So these are two elements that are important to consider when we discuss about PEDV. The PEDV is not a new disease, has been already in many markets and in China had an impact in 2012. We don\u2019t project any significant impact in our revenues in 2013 and the impact has been already incorporated in our guidance but definitely we will continue working with our customers, with producers. We ensure that we minimize the impact of this disease in their operations that can have in some of them an impact in terms of profitability and in terms of really making sure that the operation is generating the revenues and profit that they are expecting and second we\u2019re working with different stakeholders including academic institutions and one of these institutions is the University of Minnesota. We\u2019re partnering with University of Minnesota really to identify ways to protect animals and ensure that this disease is not affecting our producers.","But I want to really confirm that all these impact has been incorporated in our 2013 guidance and we do not expect a significant impact in our revenues and profits.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Yes, this question is from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","I have two questions on the revenue side, first is based on the mid-point of your 2013 guidance you\u2019re forecasting higher revenues in the second half versus the first half. You mentioned a recovery of cattle sales and I just want to know what are the other key operational reasons for the pick up or if it may just be due to seasonality. Second question I had is you continue to see as you mentioned weakness in Europe, when did you see that abating and what strategy including potential M&A do you have in place to grow the European business.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","According to our guidance for 2013 definitely the second half will go faster than the first half and the main reason for these growth is that in 2012 we had a significant impact because of the drought, the third quarter and also the fourth quarter was impacted by the drought and the drought affected not only cattle but also affected swine and poultry in 2012. So we have seen already that poultry and swine are responding very well to these market conditions and we expect cattle to recover in the second half of the year and we have positive signs the price of the corn and also the our interaction with customers are indicating that cattle will be performing better in the second half than in the first half.","All these elements are really included in our guidance and are projecting stronger growth in revenues in the second half. In Europe definitely the economic conditions in Southern Europe are affecting Western Europe but in our reporting segment we\u2019re including Europe\/Africa\/Middle East at least and while in Western Europe we\u2019ve seen the negative impact of the economic crisis and also the cold conditions in the second quarter that affected companion animal and also cattle in terms of parasiticide campaigns, we have a market in this region that are growing very nicely so countries like Russia or Middle-East or countries in Africa, South Africa especially are growing very fast. So we\u2019re confident that the combination of markets in Europe also will provide positive growth in the future.","Maybe a comment that is related to what are the projections that the analysis (ph) are making for Europe for the next five years, so they are projecting that Europe\/Africa\/Middle East will be growing around 4% to 5%. So again so we expect that Europe\/Africa\/Middle East will be positive region for Zoetis.","Rick Passov","Let me just add just a couple of points on your comment about seasonalization. So just going back to what Juan Ram\u00f3n said Q3 in 2012 was the first quarter where we felt the significant impact of the drought and Q4 to a degree we rebounded from that based not on any easing of the drought but on the decision that livestock produces made to call their herds, there is in addition to that a degree of natural seasonality in the business where Q4 tends to be a stronger quarter and to some degree Q2 as well. So hopefully that helps as well.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Yes, this question is from Tony Butler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","","If I may stay with seasonality because parasiticide in the U.S. and Europe have been delayed in Q2, would you expect them or are you seeing signs that those are actually helping Q3 again in the U.S. and Europe and if you expect that to be robust in Q3 relative to last year, does that actually cause a mix shift especially in the U.S. and hurt profits yet help profits in Europe. Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","We have seen that weather conditions in terms of warm conditions both in the U.S. and Europe are robust (ph) to normal situation and (inaudible) protecting now animals with antiparasiticide in a normal way. So this means that definitely we will see that Q3 will be a normal quarter in terms of the use of parasiticide products. And maybe you can answer in terms of the second question of Tony.","Rick Passov","I will just add a little bit in the sense that say in Europe to the extent that you have an absolutely shorter season because cold weather did last longer, you may not make that up over the course of the year and then the mix impact it's not significant enough to really drive anything at all level, yes, relatively speaking there has been a little bit of a mix impact because we\u2019re not getting the sales in parasiticides we\u2019re getting them somewhere else but not enough at the combined level to really change the flow of the numbers.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","David Krempa \u2013 Morningstar","","Can you talk a little bit more about what was causing the decline in gross margin, I know you called out one factor causing the 50 basis point decline but what was causing the other decline especially after you raised prices in the first quarter?","Rick Passov ","Sure. I think the decline that you\u2019re referring is to versus the prior year, so if I just start progression Q1 versus Q2 you see a nice improvement in gross margin over 50 basis points and now it's on track with our expectations for the full year and we believe gets us to our guidance for the full year which is between 35% and 36% and then as I called out in my comments we have a third party manufacturing business that almost exclusively relates to our having to supply product for divested products to those companies that bought those products these were mandated divestures as part of the our Wyeth, Pfizer acquisition of Wyeth and our acquisition of Fort Dodge which was a part of that and the seasonalization of those orders versus the prior year causes a year-over-year comparison that\u2019s unfavorable and then finally the carve-out financials in the prior year have some anomalies in them in part the progression of just better understanding how to allocate center cost and Pfizer to animal health and some onetime impact from changes in mark-up and system programs that were reflected more in the second quarter than in the other quarters which make the number that we show you in Q2, 2012 and our carve-outs some of the anomalies versus the progression in 2012 and cost of goods sold for the full year. So hopefully that helps. I think the main point from my perspective is looking at Q1 to Q2 we\u2019re still on track for our targeted 35% to 36% for the full year.","Dina Fede","Operator next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","","Either to Richard or Juan just sort of a macro-industry question. Your first half revenue growth was up 3% and you\u2019re expecting a recovery in the second half because of the waning of the drought to I believe about 5% when I look across the industry some of your competitors have reported below industry average growth. Are you still comfortable with 5% to 7% industry growth going forward recognizing that it's impossible to predict the weather, global warming et cetera. But it just seems to me that as you adjust for all these one timers we should get to 5% to 7% but on the other hand if we\u2019re going to have one timers every year going forward, so can you just help us to think about long term what is industry growth for animal health? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Based on industry projections and I have said this also they are projecting that the animal health will be growing between 5% to 7% as you mentioned. We\u2019re confident that the fundamentals of these growth are valid, the production (ph) growth and also the emerging markets increasing significantly the consumption of animal proteins will drive these growth that will be a positive in livestock but also more adoption of pets in emerging markets that will increase companion animal. So we\u2019re confident that this growth it's realistic and we\u2019re also confident that we can be growing inline or slightly ahead of this growth depending on the years. On 2013 as we mentioned even if the first quarter has been affected by the drought conditions we have seen positive sign that make us confident that the second half of the year will be much positive for the industry and we\u2019re affirming our guidance for 2013.","Dina Fede","Operator we have time for one more question please.","Operator","And our last question is a follow-up from the line of Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","","I just have two quick follow-ups here, I\u2019m curious about the cattle growth in the U.S. and then down in Latin America just wondering if you have any explanation what\u2019s going on in those two markets and one Ram\u00f3n I just was wondering on the e-commerce business what\u2019s your expectations and maybe if you can provide a little bit more color that is going to be something like VetStreet in the industry?","Juan Ram\u00f3n","Let me start with the e-commerce and then I\u2019ll go to the question on cattle. So definitely the e-commerce it's not like VetStreet, it's different tool so what we\u2019re doing it's really we\u2019re providing customers they go through there really to place orders and directly through the system and rather than sending the orders on paper now they can place their order through this e-commerce and this is really accurate in much easier way to really order from Zoetis. The other advantage is that the systems its open 24\/7 so they can place orders anytime they need.","Definitely this is something that we see as a complimentary with all the interactions that we have with our customers so we will remain having face to face interactions but in terms of these administrative work of orders we can do it in a way that it's easier and more efficient for them and also for us. In terms of cattle in the U.S. and in both regions the drought has affected because even in the drought was related to the U.S. the drought in the U.S. drove the price of grains and drove the price of corn which is a key element for feeding the animals and also achieving the quality of the meat that the consumers are demanding. Definitely in the U.S. we had some additional opportunities in the second quarter and that\u2019s why you may see some difference in terms of growth in these two regions but overall I think the market for both U.S. and CLAR.","In our opinion it's showing positive signs and we will see also growth in the second half in CLAR and also in the U.S. Also the U.S. has been very having positive evolution in terms of exports and this has also have a positive impact in the revenues of the U.S.","Dina Fede","That concludes our call.

And in this first year, we have made a significant progress in standing up as Zoetis has an independent public company, building the infrastructure to support our business and delivering on our financial and strategic objectives.","We concluded the year with operational revenue growth of 7% and adjusted net income growth of 32%. At species level, we deliver 8% operational growth in companion animal and operational growth of 6% in livestock. Companion animal products now account for 36% of our total annual revenues with livestock progress accounting for 64%.","In companion animal, sales of products for cats and dogs grew by 8% driven by a strong performance in the U.S., Latin America and Asia. And moderate growth in Western Europe and Australia with 4% decline in the sales of equine products. In some countries such as the U.S., there are signs of recovery in the equine market after five years of decline.","With addition of APOQUEL in 2014 to our already strong companion animal portfolio we expect to continue the positive sales growth in this segment. And I will talk more about this product later on today's call.","In livestock, sales of swine and poultry portfolio grew operationally by 12% and 10%. These industries have recovered faster than expected from the drought that affected the U.S. in 2012. These were due to feed costs and higher meat prices in 2013 and given the shortened production cycle allowing operations to more rapidly replenish the supply of animals.","In cattle, where we deliver operational growth of 2%, in the U.S. had strong show in 2013, especially in the fourth quarter. We also saw a strong performance in India and Mexico. These performances continue to be balanced by the impact of ongoing drought conditions in a number of markets including Australia.","Now, let me share with you the performance of our four regions. In Asia Pacific and on operational basis, the revenue grew in line with total Zoetis revenue. It is consistent with our expectations which have lowered during the year to reflect the continued impact of the drought in Australia and New Zealand. These two markets represent 1\/3rd of revenues for the region. Significant growth in the region came from the emerging markets of China, India and Southeast Asia as well as good performance in Japan, another large market for Zoetis. This was tampered by the flat growth in Australia and the New Zealand where as I mentioned, dry weather conditions remain.","In Canada, Latin America, as I have noted previously results of the region are primarily influenced by the performance of the two largest markets of Brazil and Canada. These countries account for over 60% of the region sales. For 2013, Brazil was the key driver of the regions growth. With the market as more companion animal business, growing at a significant pace.","We deliver slower growth rate in livestock with a strong growth in poultry and swine offset by the flat growth in cattle. Despite relatively flat industry performance in Canada, Zoetis deliver growth in this market and this was driven by market conditions positively impacting our anti-infective portfolio and cattle virus and stronger than anticipated sales of flea-and-tick sale products.","In Europe, Africa, Middle East, emerging markets contribute significantly to 2013 growth. In Russia, we see a longer term growth trend in the livestock industry where there is an increasing focus on sales efficiency in the food supply. In Western Europe, where we had our largest market, while economy challenge remained for our customers we grew modestly.","We deliver by strong growth across all species in the U.S., our largest region. In companion animal, we saw the benefit of realigning our field force to more effectively cover our customer base. This was in addition to the positive outcomes of our new cross-portfolio pricing programs.","In livestock strong growth in poultry and swine was offset by the two very different six month performance periods in cattle, the largest species in our U.S. livestock business, it was a year of two-half, if you like. In the first half of 2013, the cattle business saw the impact of higher corn prices affecting the producers demand for our products. Growth in cattle sales picked up in the second half of the year as corn prices fell. For 2014, we expect limited growth in our cattle business as ranches hold back heifers from slaughter for breading purposes. This action, while tempering growth in 2014 is a positive long-term trend for the animal health industry as it indicates the beginning of herd rebuilding. For total Zoetis, operational revenue growth of 7% comprised approximately 5% volume growth and 2% price.","Now let me provide some recent business highlights from the quarter. This demonstrates the importance of the three core interconnected capabilities of our company. We continue to benefit from our best in class field force. The commercial team remains focused on partnering with our customers to make their businesses successful. We are deepening these relationships with our customers to development of aligned platforms, so they might easily access to our produce as well as to help them better engage their clients.","According to the latest available external market data, Zoetis grew its revenues faster than the market for both the nine and 12-month periods ending September 30, 2013. This performance is based on the latest information available and we expect to continue to grow faster than the market on a total year basis for 2013.","Our investments in R&D have been productive. Through the year we have delivered a number of minimal additions and enhancement to our product portfolio. In fact, in 2013 we received many approvals including those for new medicines, claim extensions or entrance into new markets. Some of our most recent approval has been for poultry and swine.","In swine, we have continued to maximize our investment in the FOSTERA brand with the approval of FOSTERA poultry vaccine in new markets including Mexico, Korea and Thailand. Building on the success of FOSTERA and thanks to the continued innovation from our R&D team, we recently received U.S. approval of our FOSTERA PCV MH product. This is a new combination vaccine for swine and it's the first to offer one bottle, one dose convenience with the flexibility of two dose administration.","Also in the swine portfolio and during 2013, we launched the first product for our China joint venture Rui Lan An. This product is performing very well. We believe that the product could account for a growing percentage of our revenues in China and become a top 10 product in our portfolio in the market in 2014.","And now a few words on APOQUEL. This exciting new product was recently launched in the U.S., Germany, Austria and the U.K. APOQUEL is scheduled to launch in the rest of European Union as well as New Zealand in 2014. APOQUEL has been well-received by veterinarians and those of their client that participated in our clinical trials and in the early experience programs in the U.S. Customer demand to-date has already been very high and we are truly excited about its long-term potential. However, as an innovative probably a novel mechanism of action and with only a few weeks in the market it is hard to estimate what the ultimate rate of uptake will be in this product's first year.","To help manage expectations at this earlier stage we currently believe that APOQUEL could contribute approximately 1% of our revenues in 2014. This is of course dependant upon customer acceptance levels. Changing gears, through the year I have spoken about how our customer's businesses have been impacted by a number of disease outbreaks.","You would recall that we have talked previously about foreseen epidemic diarrhea virus or PEDv, which is affecting swine herds. This has been a serious impact on the industry in the United States and is now active in 23 states. Cold weather is contributing despite of the outbreak which is impacting according to recent reports up to 30% of sows in the U.S.","With information available today, we expect a reduction of approximately 4% of the U.S. swine herd and this impact has been incorporated in our guidance range. We will continue monitoring the evolution of the outbreak in the swine industry and the impact in our revenues.","As you may know, Zoetis recently announced research partnership with Iowa State University, to identify vaccine candidate to help control the virus. The partnership is one element of Zoetis ongoing effort to support swine veterinarians and pork producers in the control of PEDv.","Also in 2013, Zoetis began correlating with the University of Minnesota to develop a diagnostic test for the disease. Another disease outbreak albeit on a smaller scale has been a new strain of bronchitis affecting poultry flocks. This is a virus that has been first identified by poultry producers in the U.S. State of Georgia in 2008. But one that had began to spread to other southern U.S. states.","In 2013, in line of the continuing impact of the disease we formed an internal taskforce to deliver the USDA conditionally-licensed vaccine intended for this virus. This provides a valuable tool for our customers in reducing the affects of the disease. Efforts are currently underway to obtain a full USDA license for the vaccine. Our responses to both of these diseases outbreaks further demonstrate our partnership with our customers and the way in which our colleagues work to meet their needs.","We have remained focused on issuing a steady supply of quality medicines to our customers and the market. In 2013, we deliver sustained improvement in our product availability metrics ensuring that we can more reliable meet the demands of our customers around the world.","In 2014, our manufacturing and supply organization will include a full-year cost associated with central manufacturing functions that were build through 2013.","We are also facing some product mix headwinds higher sales in medicated feed additives on poultry together with some products not fully meeting our expectations. One example of these products is Improvac\/Improvest. This is an innovative global product that changes animal husbandry practices in the swine industry in a very important way.","We have been successful with these products in Latin America, but not yet realized its full potential in Europe and U.S. All these elements will represent a challenge to gross margin improvements in 2014.","Zoetis first year results as well as our 2014 guidance illustrate the importance of our diverse portfolio and the strength of our business model. We are committed to our long-term objective to deliver revenue growth inline with or faster than the market and realize adjusted earnings growth faster than revenues.","I believe as we are well-positioned to bring added value to our customers, colleagues and shareholders.","With that I will now ask Rick to walk us through the financial results. Rick?","Rick Passov","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning.","I will start with a review of the fourth quarter results and then I will lay out guidance for full-year 2014.","Turning to the income statement slide, for the fourth quarter revenue was approximately $1.25 billion, an increase of approximately 7% year-over-year including a negative impact of 2 percentage points from foreign exchange.","Adjusted net income was a $180 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.36. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $75 million or $0.15 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments acquisition related costs in certain significant items.","As we mentioned on last quarter's call, our fourth quarter reported results include $13 million and one-time charges related to the integration of our branded generics R&D into our global R&D operations, the divestitures of certain assets in our agricultural business and our decision to exit the manufacturing of intermediate ingredients that we believe we can source more effectively from third parties.","Also as I mentioned on our last call, during the fourth quarter, we continued to assess the carrying value of certain assets. As a result, we took a one-time charge of $17 million to reflect the impairment of one of our manufacturing facilities.","And finally, in the fourth quarter, as we continued the transition to our own shared services operation, we wrote-off approximately $17 million of inventory and intercompany accounts that would be transferred to us as part of the separation from Pfizer. Because of these expenses relate to the periods prior to 2012, and prior to our initial public offering, we do not consider them to be reflective of our current operations and are therefore, excluding them from our adjusted earnings a non-GAAP measure.","Turning now to our adjusted net income statement slide, which I will speak to on an operational basis. Again, revenue was up 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Companion animal sales grew $27 million or 7% and livestock sales grew $76 million or 10%. Adjusted cost of sales was 35.4% of revenue versus 36.3% in the year ago quarter, this reflects the impact of a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter, which included certain expenses associated with establishing our own compensation plans as well as other items related to separating from Pfizer.","Adjusted SG&A decreased by approximately 6% in the fourth quarter, this reflects good expense control as well as similar to COGS a favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2012. Adjusted R&D expense decreased approximately 1%, adjusted other income and deductions decreased to $0 in the fourth quarter of 2013. This was primarily due to a royalty true-up combined with losses on foreign exchange exposures.","Our effective adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 29% reflecting the jurisdictional mix of income and the full year benefit for the U.S. R&D tax credit. And again, on an operational basis, our adjusted net income was $180 million.","Now, on to our segment results, I will discuss these on an operational basis and it should be noted that segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and reported on an adjusted basis. Beginning with the U.S., fourth quarter revenue was $516 million, an increase of 7%. Sales of livestock products grew 8% with contributions across cattle's, swine and poultry.","Cattle products showed stronger than expected growth particularly during the later part of the quarter driven by the continued improvement of market conditions in the U.S. Swine and poultry products continue to benefit from customer acceptance of recently-launched vaccine products.","Sales of companion animal products grew 5% and U.S. segment earnings increased by 11% due to revenue growth and improvements in gross margin driven by price and volume.","Now turning to our Europe, Africa and Middle East region, in EuAfME fourth quarter revenue was $330 million, an increase of 9% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 9% driven primarily by recently launched swine and poultry vaccine products particularly in Germany and Russia. Sales of companion animal products also grew 9% and benefited again this quarter from increased sales associated with third-party manufacturing agreements. Excluding these sales, companion animal products sales grew 5%. EuAfME segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies in the quarter.","Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment or CLAR, fourth quarter revenue was $223 million, an increase of 8% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 7% driven largely by improved market conditions for cattle in Brazil and by increases in sales of medicated feed additives in poultry.","Sales of companion animal products grew 14% largely driven by sales in Canada due to favorable weather conditions and increasing medicalization of pets in Brazil. CLAR segment earnings increased 24% operationally driven by revenue growth and expense efficiencies as well as a favorable comparison to the year ago quarter.","In our Asia Pacific or APAC region, fourth quarter sales were $185 million, an increase of 14% operationally. Sales of livestock products grew 16%, India had strong poultry and cattle products sales. For poultry, this was in part due to the resolution of a prior year product registration issues for several of our vaccines.","In Japan, swine sales benefited from recently launched vaccines and China was also a leading contributor mainly in swine products. Growth in these markets more than offset the negative impact of drought conditions in Australia on sales of cattle and sheep products.","Sales of companion animal products grew 8% led by good performance for recently launched products primarily in Japan. This was partially offset by a decline in sales in Australia, reflecting the benefit in the year ago quarter of equine vaccine sales from the launch of our Hendra vaccine.","APAC segment operating earnings increased 70% operationally benefiting from revenue growth, expense efficiencies, the timing of promotional spend as well as our favorable true-up and pricing for certain purchases.","Now let me turn to guidance for full-year 2014. Our guidance for 2014 reflects foreign exchange rates from late January. For full-year 2014, we expect reported revenue of approximately $4.65 billion to $4.75 billion.","This reflects an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percentage points or approximately $100 million related to the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full-year 2014 is approximately 35.5% of revenue roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost saving efforts offset by the full-year impact of cost incurred to build our global supply functions as well as among other things headwinds from unfavorable mix.","Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million. For the full-year 2014, the midpoint of our guidance implies an improvement in the ratio of a total adjusted SG&A and R&D to revenue of approximately 50 basis points.","We are targeting this improvement despite the fact that 2014 will reflect a full-year of expenses for the standalone corporate functions that were ramping up throughout 2013. Also as we pointed out during the first two quarters of 2013, total adjusted SG&A and R&D expense was less than the full-year run rate.","As a result, year-over-year growth rate comparisons for the first two quarters of 2014 are expected to be unfavorable. Our effective tax rate on adjusted income is expected to be approximately 29% for the full year, this guidance does not reflect the potential renewal of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2014. And we expected adjusted EPS between $1.48 and $1.54 per share.","In addition to the FX impact and revenue discussed earlier, our EPS guidance also includes approximately $0.01 impact in OID from the recent evaluation of the Argentine peso. For 2014, we estimate pre-tax charges between $165 million and $185 million which primarily relate to stand-up and acquisition related cost including the impact of these items, our reported diluted EPS for the full-year 2014 is we expected it to be between $1.15 and $1.21 per share.","Our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health product this year.","In closing, now that we have a year behind us, I would like to provide an update on our perspectives on capital allocation. First, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating and feel that we would be able to do this while targeting a leverage ratio debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 2.5x. In the near term, we remain focused on completing this stand-up of Zoetis, and were incurring our recurring costs in 2014, which I discussed earlier.","For 2015, we expect stand-up and acquisition related costs to be less than half of what we expect to occur to incur in 2014. And we will continue to selectively invest in opportunities to profitably grow our business. Beyond that we will look to return capital to shareholders.","In our first year of operations as a public company we increased our dividend by 11%. As we move past the elevated spend associated with standing up our infrastructure, we believe our free cash flow should support increasing our dividends at or above earnings growth for some period of time. Of course, this is based on current expectations and any future increase would be subject to Board approval.","That concludes my prepared remarks and now we will open the line for your questions. Dina?","Dina Fede","Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Our first question is coming from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks very much for the question. The first question, you reported two consecutive very strong top line results with roughly 9% constant currency growth because I was a bit surprised by the 3% sales growth guidance in 2014, I guess more like 5% constant currency. Just elaborate a little bit more what's happening here that you are seeing a slower growth.","The second question was on operating margins. I think you mentioned 100 to 150 basis points of expansion this year despite some unfavorable year-over-year expense comps. How do we think about long-term leverage in the model, when we look beyond 2014 and some of these one-time factors kind of getting behind the company? Can we think about maybe more on the 150 end or even larger operating margin expansion opportunities over time? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Let me take the first question on our revenue position for the 2014. And in 2013, we had significant growth in two species, swine and poultry. Swine grew by 12% and poultry by 10%. We also and we think that this two species will have more moderated growth in 2014 much more in line with the market growth.","The second element that we also included in our projections for 2014 was in companion animal, we expected the entrance of new classes of molecules in parasiticide. We also expect some additional competition for Rimadyl, generic competition for Rimadyl in the U.S. and of course this will be balanced with the launch of APOQUEL that also will generate a significant growth.","In cattle, which is the largest livestock species, we expect that in 2014, the cattle ranches will rebuild the herd and as a consequence of that there will be less animals place in the feedlots and this will have an impact in terms of \u2013 and the sales of our products.","Considering all these elements, we think that the projections that we are making for 2014 are realistic and also in line what we can expect also from the market growth. May be Rick can provide some details on gross margin?","Rick Passov","All right. Yes. Chris, I just want to make sure that my numbers were heard correctly and that I understood the numbers that you discussed. So on operating margin in 2013 roughly there is a 300 basis point improvement. What I said in my comments was that the ratio of SG&A to R&D in 2014 based on the midpoint of our guidance is going to be roughly 50 basis point improvement there about. And then as we also spoke on the call, gross margin had a modest improvement in 2013 and our outlook there is flat for 2014 and we described some of the reasons that are driving that.","So and in terms of a longer term perspective, again, we go back to the basic premise, we believe we will grow at or in line with market. We believe over the long-term our expenses will grow considerably less than that. And we think that margin from there kind of cancels out.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","And we will go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Just following up on kind of the underlying market growth assumptions, are you seeing greater use of medications by hog farmers with PEDv going around the country and also with 9 million pounds of beef recalled out in California and a plant shut down, doesn't that make the existing cattle herd even more valuable so that could also drive increases in medications?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you for the question Kevin. And you are right. We expect that with fewer animals, these animals will have more valuable to the cattle businesses and we expect that also they will ensure that they have the right healthcare protocols to keep these animals for that business. But this will be compensated in someway because of the fewer animals that will be available for placement in 2014 based on the assumption that the ranchers will probably rebuild the herd and this will keep these animals for this purpose.","In terms of greater use of medicines because of PEDv what we have seen is that definitely the PEDv it's reducing the number of animals available. I mention that the sows affected by the PEDv in the U.S. it's about 30% and it is expected to have an impact of reduction of 4% in terms of total animals available in the market. What the producers are indicating is that the way that they expect to compensate these fewer animals it will be to have these animals longer in terms of reaching higher weight that will also contain the number of pork available to the market. This may represent an opportunity if they keep these animals longer also to keep these animals under certain healthcare protocols. Although when they reach certain weight they are less vulnerable to infections or other diseases.","Dina Fede","Operator, our next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, we had a quite a few calls this morning from investors regarding the guidance that you gave for 2014 and maybe some more explanation behind it, but I'll just delve back on that again. So I'm kind of curious how we should think about modeling your top line and bottom line growth longer term. I understand some of the headwinds this year and, should we just be patient the 2013, 2014 there are some meaningful headwinds and then after that we should kind of get to the kind of growth rate that people had expected at the time of the IPO, which is more 6% to 7% top line and double digit bottom line growth?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And in terms of revenues, we see that Zoetis will be growing in this five years companion animal growth in line with the market and the market is expected to grow around 5% to 6%. We also expect that our expenses will be inline with inflation and we also expect that we will generate gross margin improvement over time. Let me provide may be some comments on why we are not meeting our objective for 2014 in terms of gross margin.","So one element it's the mix of products. So in 2013, we have the significant growth in swine and poultry especially in poultry that the margins are lower and these also creating some mix challenge in terms of gross margin. We also had some geographies that also impacting the mix of geographies are also impacting our geography, we are growing faster in some of the major markets and these are major markets they still have lower margin that than more developed markets. The third element is that in 2014, we are facing some unexpected synergies like freight. Again, so it's something that definitely we are working and we expect this something that will not have a long-term impact since we will be able really to achieve our target in terms of this kind of cost.","We see that also some of this additional impact in cost will be offset by cost reductions also will be offset by pricing but there are some elements that also are affecting our gross margin improvement in 2014. We were expecting to generate significant growth out of a product that has a significant potential, it's a product that it's called Improvest\/Improvac this product has been extremely successful in Brazil and we were expecting the same kind of success in Europe and the U.S.","Unfortunately the market acceptance is taking longer in these two important regions and these are having an impact in terms of revenues but also in terms of volume that it will be absorbing significant cost in our operations. We still remain convinced that this product is really providing a significant opportunities not only in terms of replacing surgical castration in pigs to eliminate boar tint but also having feed enhancement that will result also in higher productivity for the swine producers.","These products have a significant opportunity and we expect that this product will generate revenues and also a positive impact in our gross margin in the future. We expect that our actions that we are taking in 2014 will result in cost, of course improvement in 2015 and 2016 and also beyond. So we are committed to improve our gross margin and we see that this situation in 2014 is a temporary situation that we expect to solve in the future.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We'll go next go to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about your business development strategy and whether you are primarily focused on livestock and companion animal businesses, it would seem there are number of promising companion animals which add new assets out there?","And if I may follow up, your revenue this quarter benefited from again from third party manufacturing agreement, how should we think about this opportunity in 2014? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay. Let me start with the business development and also Rick can provide comments on the third party manufacturing agreements. In terms of BD, we will remain focused on ensuring that we maximize the opportunities that we have in our portfolio and also the opportunities that will generate through our investments in R&D will not exclude opportunities in terms of adding products for a certain species or certain therapeutic classes in where we can really fill gaps or also expanding our presence in some of the markets.","But definitely, it's something that we will consider opportunities as they come. And there will be two conditions that always will be in our analysis, one the strategic feed and the second the financial to support that acquisition. We are not really focused on either livestock on companion animal, I think something that we will be open to any opportunity that will meet these two conditions.","Rick Passov","And then Alex on the question on the third-party manufacturing to remind us again of what that is, we're obligated to provide supply for some of the divested products plus we also now have a small component of third-party manufacturing that we do on behalf of Pfizer. We do expect that the amount of this volume for us will decline around 15% year-over-year probably in the early 50 millions to somewhere in the early 40 millions and we haven't made a long-term decision about the extent to which we'll decide to continue on some of these contracts as they decline or what kind of partnership will remain with Pfizer we're on \u2013 in the long-term where this fits into our overall manufacturing operations.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Bank of America","Hi, it's Erin Wilson. Juan Ram\u00f3n, I guess going back to the revenue growth questions in the press release and then in the prepared remarks do you see that the 2014 outlook supports your overall long-term goal of faster than market growth? But the guidance seems to call for at least in line if not below the industry trend, what's the disconnect there in light of kind of the new product launches and recent strength you've see?","My second question would be just broadly speaking to the slower growth in livestock markets and inherently lower margin business positively impact the product mix on a gross margin standpoint, so could there be upside to your estimates there?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay. In terms of our performance against the market, while the information available today its the third quarter year-to-date where we have been growing significantly faster than the market in 2013. And we expect also the fourth quarter to confirm these results. If, what we always communicated, it's our commitment to grow inline or faster than market on a companion animal terms. And if you take our growth in 2013, and also with the projections that we are making for 2014, we think that this growth in companion animal growth will be faster than the market.","We expect that the new products will add some additional revenues and APOQUEL is a very good example. But you need to also to keep in mind that in 2013, we also launched a significant number of products, so we generated very positive growth of new products in 2013. And I think it's something that definitely we are convinced that at the end of the year, so the growth that we will be generating will be supporting this growth faster than the market or inline with the market.","The second question was slower livestock growth and positive for gross margin. While there are many different elements in this statement, so one its -- I mentioned that we are growing now faster than in poultry and swine than in cattle. And this is having an impact in our gross margin. Second element, we have also been growing at least in 2013, so we have now a higher base of medicated feed additives also with the lower margin than pharmaceuticals or vaccine.","And the third element is the growth in emerging markets and this growth in emerging markets it's \u2013 well, there are two components definitely the companion animal but also they are growing very fast in terms of livestock. All these elements are driving our gross margin performance in 2014.","Rick, I don't know if you want to add any other comment?","Rick Passov","The only small amount of color, I would add is just that if we look also Erin, I think you had said that the lower growth that we might be anticipating on a relative basis year-over-year in livestock would be an improvement in margin. I think Juan Ram\u00f3n answered that I think also its worth pointing out that in companion animal we have new products and we also have some new competitors and those things are balanced in our forecast for the companion animal growth in 2014 as well.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","We will go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey, guys thanks for taking the question. Also thanks for all the quick very clear commentary. I just, hey, Rick, I just want to make sure I've got some math correct. You mentioned I think I heard you say something like $100 million currency impact to your 2014 guidance, just clarify that should we basically just be adding if you wanted to do constant currency should we just be adding $100 million to your revenue guidance. And if I were to do that to try to create more of a like-for-like comparison it looks to me like your operating margins in 2014 will expand not 50 basis points, but about 130 basis points. Is my math correct or was there also some kind of offsetting impact on the OpEx line from the fluctuations you expect in currency?","And then just a follow up is, if your revenue guidance proves conservative, if it were as analyst investors should we still look at your SI&A (sic) SG&A and R&D dollar guidance as the number that you are going to shoot for? Even if you get lucky and say your revenue growth is 2% or 3% higher than what you're projecting? Thanks again for all the detail.","Rick Passov","Mark, no problem. Let me just start back at the very beginning of the question. So at the average rate of FX for us over the course of 2013, we're giving you this range of about $100 million of lost revenue. If we were to apply the average rates in 2013 across how we expect the numbers to roll-out for us in 2014, exactly how that falls through the P&L there are a lot of different ways that you can do it, we haven't really worked out that math for us but you can use the P&L is an indicative model or hair cut that in a number of different ways.","And in terms of -- to the extent that we get more or less revenue what is going to be the impact on SG&A as a percent of sales. I think it depends on a lot of factors, we can find ourselves in periods of time where revenue growth is also being accompanied by more promotional activities. So it's hard for me to give you a fixed line there. And also want to make sure that I'm not misquoted on the 50 basis points that I spoke to. Again, in my prepared remarks, I was simply saying that if you take the midpoint of the guidance for just SG&A and just R&D as a percent of revenue, you'll see that they were targeting in that midpoint range roughly 50 basis point improvement.","I'm simply pointing out that in a year when we are facing peak to synergies as part of the standup from \u2013 in our standup efforts, we're still showing you at least in this ratio cost improvement benefits. And then I'd also point out that we had negative SG&A growth in 2013. So, if you add up 2013 and 2014, I think you get a year representative of what Juan Ram\u00f3n has described as an average year that's representative of what Juan Ram\u00f3n has described as our longer term goals.","Dina Fede","","Operator, next question please.","Operator","","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Kreger - William Blair","","Hi. Thanks very much. Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the underlying assumptions for the 2014 guidance. Are you assuming any improvement in the economic environment particularly on the companion side? And what about the price versus volume mix that underlies that 2% to 4% revenue growth expectation? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Probably the answer to that, it's not completely straight forward. So we expect some economic improvement in some of the European markets. At the same time there are uncertainties at this point in some of the emerging economies. And in these economies, I think it's something that at this point we are taking some questions in terms of growth that these economies will generate and also the impact that these growth will have in the animal healthcare industry.","That's why we're still providing this range that is reflecting these uncertainties that we still have not only related to the economies but also related to some environmental factors that can be affecting our business. On the second question, it's what about the --","Rick Passov","Pricing.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","The pricing volume in \u2013 so in 2013, we generated higher volumes than price in our total revenue growth. I mentioned that on the 7% operational growth, 5% was volume, 2% was price. We expect that in 2014, the growth will be balanced between price and volume. And definitely we see opportunities of price increases in both livestock and also companion animal and also both in developed animal healthcare markets. Although, we see that emerging markets we will have a much more moderated price increases than a developed markets.","Dina Fede","Next question please.","Operator","","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, Juan Ram\u00f3n and Rick. I have a couple of questions mainly about the financials. So, first with respect to FX, Rick, could you just talk about the impact of FX on the bottom-line in 2013? And then obviously, FX benefits your operating expenses in 2014.","Is there any way to characterize the FX driven reduction in operating cost for 2014? And then separately with respect to corporate costs, could you just remind us where your corporate costs are, where they were in 2013 and how we should think about that number trending over time and whether there are any meaningful cost reduction opportunities or not? Thank you.","Rick Passov","","Thank you for the question, David. Let me start with the FX piece. The FX impact for 2013 was considerably less than what we're seeing in 2014. And yes, there is an FX component that would be somewhat of a benefit to SG&A but less so than you might think depending on which geographies we're making investments for growth and as well less so from an R&D perspective.","And then \u2013 I'm sorry what was the \u2013 the second question was the kind of -- how to look at our corporate costs. So, one thing that is between 2012 and 2013 is a reallocation between what's in R&D which is part of our corporate function and what was in unallocated overhead bucket in our carve out financials that helps you sort of see 2012 and 2013 change.","And then as we spoke in the other parts of what we call our corporate costs are a couple of things the build up of essential organization for manufacturing, so we built our own global supply points. And then as well those functions that resided in Pfizer where there was no analog in Zoetis. So, tax, treasury P&A to a large degree, internal audit and so on and as well the IT function.","And the majority of the standup delta if you will, maybe I could use the word synergies have been occurred to-date and I think we've done a very good job of offsetting them. They don't on a \u2013 where you'll see the largest impact if you will is comparing the rate of growth in SG&A for example in Q1 of 2014 to the rate of growth in Q1 of 2013 and that's because in Q1 of 2013 and in Q2 of 2013 we called out that \u2013 the SG&A plus R&D as a percent of revenue was below what we expected the run rate would be for the full-year or even our indicative run rate.","And so, when you make those quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons, you'll see somewhat unfavorable growth but it will certainly balance out pretty well as we get through the rest of the year. And then going forward, again, I think that the operating leverage is going to come from that basic tenant that we keep going back to growing at or faster than the market and controlling operating expenses to be roughly in line with inflation and modest gross margin improvement.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","","We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ariel Herman - Goldman Sachs","","Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jami. So, wanted to follow up on two things. First, is there an updated view on your thoughts around M&A and further industry consolidation? And do you guys see yourself as participating with that and if so do you guys need M&A to sustain margin expansion.","And then just separately going back to the revenue outlook, so I understand there is some one-time events in 2014 such as the moderate growth in swine and poultry, but 2013 also had some one-time event such as drought that I would have thought would have made good comps for 2014. So just thinking longer term, how do you get back to that 5% to 6%? And how should we think about growth in each regional segment within that overall company growth? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Ariel, for the question. Let me answer first the second question on the projections for 2014 and the different impact of the drought. The drought of the U.S. in 2012 had different impact depending on the species. Definitely on swine and poultry, we saw that the impact in these two species in 2013 was much softer than we expected. In fact these two species recovered very fast even in the first half of 2013 from the drought, because of mainly at that time, the meat price grew significantly. And then in the second half of the year, the prices remained high, but also the prices for corn were much lower than 2012.","So, in these two species the drought had a very little impact, in fact swine and poultry for us grew by 12% and 10%. It is a different \u2013 the situation for the cattle industry. So the cattle industry in the first half of 2013 was affected by the drought but had a significant recovery in the second half of the year. So in total as I mentioned these species grew by 3% in our revenues.","What we expect in 2014 is to have full-year of normalized weather conditions. But, because of the projections on cattle are now positive, the ranchers have decided that to increase the herd. The result of increasing the herd as I mentioned will be less animals place in the feedlot where the majority of the process are used and then the better situation in terms of weather conditions will be in some way offset by the fact that there will be fewer animals to treat in the feedlot.","If I move to the first question in terms of my views in terms of M&A. So definitely, it has been a lot of news recently from other animal health companies, I think we will not enter in speculating what will be the outcome of all these strategic reviews that other competitors are making. We are convinced that our internal growth will be supporting our objectives of growing in line or faster than the market in this companion animal growth in middle to long-term. And we see maybe opportunities on some of the complementary spaces or some of the process that will be filling gaps in our portfolio.","And one important element is that we already have our market share which is close to 20%, 19%. This can create some challenge in terms of antitrust. And it is something that we will really -- understanding and monitoring all the different decisions that our competitors will be making and then we'll decide depending on what will be available in the market.","Dina Fede","Operator, next question please.","Operator","","We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.","Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi","","Good morning. Just one quick question on your tax rate. Rick, did you see any opportunities to reduce your effective tax rate going forward and is this a focus for you at all? Thanks very much.","Rick Passov","Thank you, for the question. We get that a lot. Tax is obviously, for a number of reasons, are out in the\u2013 somebody has their line open -- are in front of us quite a lot. I would say that we're seeing the opportunity for some marginal lowering of the effect of tax rate just based on the good cash flow generation in the business and what we see our future needs are. And in terms of what the ultimate degree of freedom is for us to change our tax rate.","We're pretty much where we're going to be plus the benefit of the R&D tax credit which we'd like to see at some point during 2014 and perhaps could add the opportunity to lower the 29% by up to about 50 basis points. And then I think there that's going to be good long-term estimate of what the effective tax rate is for Zoetis.","Dina Fede","Operator, I think we have time for one more question please.","Operator","","We'll take our last question from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Krempa \u2013 Morningstar","","Thanks for taking my question. Just quick follow-up on that tax question, would you guys ever be open to an inversion that would significantly lower that tax rate but might also bringing in some human health products?","Rick Passov","That's an interesting question. I can understand the reason why it's asked. And obviously, a number of companies have found something in that strategy that works for them, but it's not something that we're contemplating.","Dina Fede","Thank you. That concludes our call.

Our reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S GAAP measure is included in the financial table that accompany our earnings press release and is a company's 8-K filing dated today, April 30th, 2013.","With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Dina, and hello everyone.  Thank you for joining today's earning call.  I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you about our results for the first quarter of 2013.  Since our IPO in February, the entire Zoetis team has been focused on establishing our new company.  The 9,000 plus Zoetis colleagues are on the world have demonstrated their passion for building on our six decade history and singular focus on animal health to continue to bring our customers quality products, services and commitment to their business.","It has been a crucial time as we continue to establish our new company, and I am very pleased to share that the work we are doing is already paying up.  In the first quarter 2013, we reported revenue growth of 4%, 5% operational and adjusted net income growth of 18%.  The performance demonstrate our commitment to continue to grow earnings through right allocation of resources and the pursuit of our growth strategies.","We believe that our diversity across many dimensions is our competitive strength.  These dimensions include region, species, product and therapeutic area.  One example that reflects this strength is the performance of our U.S. business.  Here, the drought continued to impact sales of our cattle products.  This was balanced by a growth in companion animal sales and strong performance of our poultry and swine products.","As Dina mentioned, Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer, will provide more details of information associated with each of the regions related on the call.  He will also provide our full-year 2013 net guidance.","Let me first highlight the three interconnected capabilities of Zoetis which I believe continue to contribute to the overall performance of our company.  The first of these is our direct sales and marketing model.  Our worldwide geographic footprint enables Zoetis to have a field force present in about 70 countries, in both develop and emerging markets.  We are active in 120 plus countries and we are leader in nearly all of the main regions in which we operate.  We work constantly with our customers to provide them innovative products, services and support that will make a difference for their businesses.  We also strive to make doing business with us easy, efficient and meaningful.","The second capability is leadership in product research and development, which is best evidence through our expenses and the diverse product portfolio.  In addition to our R&D program for new products, we also apply a focus on brand lifecycle management.  These involve efforts to improve the performance and delivery of our current product lines, the expansions of product indications across species and the pursuit of approval across new geographies.","For example, in Japan, we recently achieved registration of Fostera PCV, a vaccine for swine respiratory diseases.  Also, in Japan, we recently launched DRAXXIN, an injectable antibiotic for cattle and swine.  That is one of our top-selling products globally.","And in China, we saw a launch of Convenia, an antibiotic for cats and dogs, first launched in European and European Union in 2006, which is now one of our premier companion animal products.","And finally, on our capabilities, our high quality products, which are delivered by our world-class manufacturing operations. We continue to play some important emphasis on our internal factoring and supply capability. It provide us with key advantage in the animal health care market. ","We are continually looking to enhance our operation effectiveness and bring innovation to our processes. These will increase our manufacturing efficiencies and expand production margins. Most importantly, these have been achieved while delivering high levels of the quality and consistent levels of supply.","In spite of economy crisis, weather-related challenges around the world and even disease outbreaks in some countries, we believe the fundamentals of our animal health industry are very strong. What we are seeing today on longer term provides continued opportunity for our company.","The population of our world continues to grow.  By 2050 it could be more than 9 billion people.  In addition, emerging markets are seeing growth in the middle class sectors of their societies.  These factors are creating increased levels of consumption of animal protein at a time of limited natural resources including at our land and water. These are significant opportunity for animal health companies that can bring the innovation to face the challenge to produce more with less.","Furthermore, improved standards of living are leading the high levels of pet ownership and more spending on the medical care of these animals.  These creating opportunities to grow trend in similar expenditure within the pet care sector both in established and emerging markets.","Here, at Zoetis, we are continued to partner with veterinarians and livestock producers across the globe to better understand the ways in which we can support them.  For example, last month in Argentina we signed an agreement with a large dairy partner to perform genomic tests on their herds using Clarifide, a genetic marker.  Through the use of these products, Zoetis is helping these partners to make informed decisions and manage their livestock more efficiently.","As well as work under taken to maintain our market leading position and support our customers, we are also delivering on our plans to stand up the company.  I\u2019m pleased with the proudest we have made on this important work since the IPO and the plant we have in place to progress this.","And with that, let me thank you for your attention and your interest in Zoetis.  I will now hand over to Rick Passov, our Chief Financial Officer, and ask him to walk us through the financials.  Rick?","Rick Passov","Thank you, Juan Ramon, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us today.  When we conducted our pre-IPO road show a few months, we enjoyed the opportunity to introduce the financial community to Zoetis.  With today\u2019s conference call, we look forward to beginning a regular cycle of communication with you.","Let me begin by explaining the basis of how we present our financial this year.  While our results are reported in accordance with US GAAP, our commentary will largely speak to financial results on an adjusted basis.  These adjusted figures including adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are non-GAAP measures.  They exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items such as the non-recurring costs of becoming a standalone public company.","We also cite operational results, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and demonstrate the underlying performance of our business. We believe that providing these views of our performance, which are used by management to evaluate the business, will enhance your understanding of our financial results.","Our financial results reflect how we manage our business on a regional basis.  In addition to the company\u2019s overall income statement, we provide revenues and earnings for our four regional operating segments, the United States, Europe, Africa and Middle East or EuAfME; Canada and Latin America or CLAR; and Asia Pacific or APAC.","While we manage the business by regional segments, we are also providing supplemental information about each segment's total revenue broken down by livestock and companion animal categories.  These and other additional details are included in the tables accompanying our press release, which are also located on our website.","Given we were not a standalone company in 2012, let me briefly discuss the basis for our year-over- year comparisons.  As indicated in our recent 10-K filing, our financial statements for 2012 and prior years have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Pfizer.  These include allocations for direct costs and indirect costs, which were attributed to the animal health business of Pfizer.","Some of these allocations, for example, were for certain support functions that were provided on the centralized basis within Pfizer such as expenses for certain aspect of business technology, facilities and other corporate functions.  Pfizer will continue to provide some of the services to Zoetis under transitional service agreements or what you may hear us call TSAs.","As we noted in prior filings, the combined financial statements for 2012 do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations would have been had we operated as a standalone public company.  As a result, this can make comparisons to the prior year difficult in certain instances.","First quarter 2013 financials will include allocations from Pfizer through our IPO.  For all periods going forward, our results will be based on a direct cost associated with the standalone operations, not allocations.  Those results will include costs related to services we receive from Pfizer under the TSAs that I mentioned.","Turning now to our financial results for the first quarter of 2013, our first quarter 2013 revenues were approximately $1.09 billion, an increase of approximately 4% year-over-year including a negative impact of 1% from foreign exchange.  We reported operational growth across each of our regional segments led by increased revenues in the US segment.","Reported net income of $140 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.28 increased approximately 26% and 26% respectively.  On an adjusted basis, net income of $179 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.36 showed an increase of approximately 18% and 20% respectively.","The adjusted net income excludes the impact of $9 million of purchase accounting adjustments, $4 million of acquisition related costs and $27 million of certain significant items.  We believe this first quarter results represent a solid start of the year showing the diversity of our business across products, species and geographies, and demonstrate an ability to grow earnings faster than sales.","Turning to our adjusted net income statement, revenues were up about 5% operationally excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  Adjusted cost of sales was approximately 36.5% of revenues versus 37.1% in the year ago quarter.  Adjusted SG&A and adjusted R&D expense both decreased approximately 3%.","Since we continue to build our infrastructure, our SG&A expenses this quarter do not yet reflect our expected full run rate of expenses for 2013.","Adjusted interest expense increased to $22 million in the first quarter of 2013 from $8 million in the first quarter of 2012.  This increase reflects our debt issuance in January of this year.  Adjusted other income and deductions in the quarter declined to a deduction of $2 million in the first quarter of 2013 from income of $6 million in the first quarter of 2012.  This decline is primarily driven by the non-recurring impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation.","Our effective adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 29% including the non-recurring benefit of a US R&D credit which was retroactively extended in January of 2013.","And finally, our adjusted net income increased approximately 18% to $179 million for the first quarter.","Now, on to our operating segment results which I will discuss on an operational basis.  These segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and are reported on an adjusted basis as I described earlier.  Beginning with the US, first quarter revenues were $454 million, an increase of 7%, and earnings grew approximately 8%.  Companion animal revenues increased by approximately 13%.  This growth reflects, among other things, continuing demand for products and the positive impact of the competitor supply issue which has now been resolved.","Livestock revenues in the US grew 2% versus the year ago quarter.  Strong sales of both poultry and swine products were largely offset by a decline in product sales for cattle due to the negative impact of ongoing drought conditions in the US.  In EuAfME, first quarter sales were $290 million, an increase of approximately 4%, while earnings increased about 16%.  These results were driven primarily by herd companion animal product sales increased to approximately 6% and by 3% growth in sales of livestock products especially in swine and poultry.","Results were also favorably impacted by the timing of price increases in certain European markets.  In EuAfME, we continued to see challenging economic conditions particularly in Southern Europe and we expect an unseasonably cold weather across much of Europe will likely delay the start of the parasiticide season, which normally begins early in the second quarter.","In CLAR, first quarter sales were $171 million, an increase of approximately 4%, while earnings increased about 9%.  Results in this region are largely driven by performance in its two largest markets Brazil and Canada.  Livestock product sales increased 6% primarily due to these two markets.  Sales growth of cattle products in Canada was driven a strong fall calf season, while in Brazil we saw growth in both swine and poultry product sales.","Sales of companion animal products decreased 5%, primarily due to the favorable impact in the year ago quarter of a competitor supply issue in Canada.  In Latin American market, this quarter particularly in Brazil we continued to see growth in companion animal product sales.","Finally, in APAC, first quarter sales were $175 million, an increase of 2%, while earnings in the region increased 6%.  Livestock product sales increased to approximately 3% driven largely by our sales of swine products particularly in Australia, while drought conditions in Southern Australia continue to impact the dairy industry, and Japan continues to be impacted by the ongoing economic challenges in that market.  Finally, companion animal product sales in APAC increased by approximately 2% operationally.","Now, let us turn to guidance for 2013.  This guidance assumes a blend of actual exchange rates in effect during the first quarter of 2013 and mid April exchange rates for the remainder of the year.  We expect reported revenues of approximately $4.425 billion to $4.525 billion for the full year.  We expected an adjusted to cost to sales as percentage of revenue to be between 35% and 36%.  Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.385 billion and $1.435 billion.  Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $385 million and $415 million, and we expect the tax rate on adjusted income of approximately 29.5% for the full year.","We also expect to incur non-reoccurring costs largely related to standing up the company of between approximately $200 million to $240 million in 2013.  These costs will be excluded from our adjusted numbers.","While our quarterly results are subject to some variability related to weather patterns and herd management decisions, our annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year.","That concludes my prepared remarks and now we'll open the line for your questions.  Dina?","Dina Fede","Thank you, Rick.  Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n.  Operator, we are ready for our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Operator instructions.  Our first question comes from the site of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much and congrats on the first quarter out here.  I just had two quick questions.  The first one is just if this is your initial guidance call, can you just walk through some of the factors that could put you at the high or low end of your revenue range this year?  And I guess that you were discussing that specifically what's reflected in these numbers in terms of a recovery from the drought in the US?  My second question was SG&A, the guidance looking like a second year in a row here of expenses that are kind of flattish.  Do you have a longer term model, I know you're not providing guidance beyond 2013, but is it fair to think about SG&A that that's flat or that we could see inflation like growth in SG&A as we think about the model evolving over the next few years?  Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Chris, and let me provide some comments on the two questions and probably Rick will explain some of my remarks.  So, first, I think there is still some uncertainties related to the drought, and depending on the impact of the drought we will be able to really to go higher or lower in the range that that we have provided.  Also, we expect some recovery in European market that also can drive some of the revenues that we expect for the year and, again, this will impact the total revenues that that will be really reported at the end of the year.","In terms of SG&A, I think definitely our model is to grow revenues faster than expenses, and it is something that definitely we achieve that in the past and we will continue really growing revenues much faster than expenses.  So, Rick, do you want to add some other comments?","Rick Passov","No, I think all I would add just in particular with respect to Q1 is that SG&A does reflect the pace of building up infrastructure here, and I think as you will see when you do the math, the number is a little bit less than what we expect it to be on a run rate to revenue for the full year.","Operator","We will go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.  Go ahead, you line is open.","Ann Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, this is Ann Wilson in for Bob today.  I understand I guess the lingering effect of the drought or rain on the US livestock business near term but could you comment on the impacts of a later or possibly reduce corn planting expected this year?  Would that be, potentially have a meaning for impact and how should we think about that going forward?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","At this point, there are still uncertainties about the corn production in the US for 2013.  We know that we moved from a drought last year from now a flood in some parts of the corn belt that is really delaying seeding corn in the US.  At the same time, we know that some of the markets they saw the opportunity of the high prices of corn last year really to increase the production of corn.  So, at this point, it's a little bit complicated to know what will be the level of price of corn in 2013.  What we see today is that the price is lower than the record price in 2013, that it was close to $9 the bushel, and now we are around $6 and $6.5 or so.  I think this is something that will create probably a better opportunity for our livestock producer in terms of the input cost.","Ann Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.  Great and what was -- ","Operator","We will go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.  Go ahead, your line is open.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much and congrats on the results.  I wanted to ask two questions please.  The first is a high level question about Europe.  (inaudible) had said a week ago that meat supply is exceeding demand ex-US and that is slowing livestock industry growth.  Could you please offer your comments on that?  And then, second, a financial question for Rick.  Could you talk about tax rate reduction opportunities to take the tax rate below 29% in the out years?  Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, David.  One of the strengths of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio in terms of the geographies, in terms of species, in terms of (inaudible) carriers.  And what we have seen in the first quarter has been a reduction on sales of cattle products.  But we increased significantly revenues generated by swine and poultry in many different geographies.  We also had a very strong performance in companion animal.","In terms of the price of the meat, I think it is -- we think that in some parts of the geographies where there where extra supply of meat and then this drop price down.  But this is something that we expect some -- well, these are temporary adjustment and we do not see that this will have a significant impact in the rest of the year.","We are still committed to our numbers that has been provided to here to-date.  And what we will see is that among different quarters are some fluctuations in terms of the results.  But definitely our industry should be really accessed on yearly basis and this were we think that we are focused on delivering our numbers at the end of the year.  Rick, do you want really to maybe expand of these question and also to answer the tax rate?","Rick Passov","I will just turn to the tax rate actually and, David, just say that the tax rate that we are providing in our guidance is a good estimate of what we think our tax rate will be over the long-term, it may vary somewhat around the estimated rate but that it's clearly our intended target.  And when you look at the rate comparative similarly situated multi nationals it's a rate that I think you would expect to see.","Operator","We will go next to Louise Chen with Guggenheim.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim","Hi, good morning.  Thank you for the question.  I was curious, if you could provide more color behind the specifics that would drive down your cost of goods sold and SG&A over time? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay.  Thank you, Louise.  And I will just provide a general comment and I will ask Rick to go into the details.  Definitely, we will see in terms of cost of goods that will benefit on probably two or three important factors.  One will be price increase.  And I like to really confirm that in the first quarter we increased the prices across species and across geographies.  And second, we also continue focus on cost improvements in our manufacturing network.","In terms of SG&A, I think definitely we will continue having the right discipline in terms of allocation of resources.  And we expect SG&A growing lower than revenues and this is something that has been done in the past and we will continue in the future.  Rick?","Rick Passov","I will just repeat, Louise and again thank you for a question.  Volume, price increase, some products moving back into our network and very good cost discipline across the country -- the company.","Operator","We will go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.  Go ahead your line is open.","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Good morning.  Thanks for taking questions.  I guess just wanted to ask about the strong companion animal growth in U.S.  Curious as to what you think the sustainable growth is in that segment and what opportunities you see in terms of using your balance sheet and cash flow, so I guess also what are your thoughts on capital allocation may be extending it to diagnostics or something like that?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, thank you, Kevin.  And we are very pleased with the performance of companion animal in the U.S.  We are enjoying a very good momentum in terms of sales.  But in the first quarter, we also had the positive impact of one competitor facing supply issues.  This supply issue has been solved and this competitor is already back into the market in the U.S.  But still, we think that our companion animal is very strong in the U.S.  We also apply price increases in the U.S. in the first quarter, and this was well accepted by our customer which is showing the right partnership that we are having with them.  And we are optimistic about the future performance of companion animal in the U.S. because I think we have right strategies, the right programs and also the interaction with the customer, direct interaction with the customer that is allowing really to maximize our product portfolio.  And Rick will answer on the capital allocation.","Rick Passov","Kevin, again, thank you for the question.  Our priorities for capital allocation are going to be as follows.  Over the next few years, we are going to complete the stand up of our own infrastructure which will call for elevated levels of spend that we discussed both on this call and in our 10-K.  We'll position ourselves for certain amount of deleveraging as we come closer to our first debt securities.  We will pay the dividend that we've declared.  And we will pursue some M&A bolt on acquisitions that leverage our core strengths.  And then, beyond that, an ongoing capital allocation discipline is going to be hall mark of Zoetis.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Let me add one comment on companion animal in the U.S.  We have seen that the visit to clinics are now increasing in the U.S.  And also the expend of pet owners per pet is also increasing.  So, this is good trend and our presence in many different (inaudible) areas in companion animal really providing to us quite opportunity for performance and we expect that this performance will be sustainable over in 2013.","Operator","The next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Mark Schoenebaum - ISI Group","Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question and congratulations on well managed, a very well managed quarter.  I had, first question is a housekeeping one.  I didn\u2019t hear on the prepared remarks.  Would it be possible for you to give us price versus volume growth in both the congenial segment and the livestock segment on a worldwide basis?  Also, if you could provide a regionally in the U.S., that would be really helpful price versus volume.  And the second question is more like along term speculative thing, your question, but the avian flu in China.  I know your China business right now is very small, but has this had any, any material impact to that small business segment for you, and maybe you can give history lesson the impact that prior avian flus have had on the business, if any?  Thank you very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Mark, and our prices strategy is really depending on many same factors including species, including also geographies, including also competition.  So it is difficult really to provide a global comment on our price strategy.  That's really in emerging markets volume is much higher than price while in developed markets price is higher than that volume.  In the U.S. that's really a in, we have seen that many of the species, price has been growing at a higher rate than volume.  But it is something that is part of our model and we don't see that as a negative.  On the contrary, it's a good opportunity for really to apply price strategies that will maximize our margins across many different geographies and species.","In terms of the avian flu, well you mentioned that it still something that it's not a significant impact.  So China for us represent a little bit less than that 2% of our total revenues, and the majority of this revenues as rated in the swine business.  So the poultry business, it's definitely a future growing opportunity, but it's really having a minimal impact in our total revenues.  What we are concerned is really how we can really provide the support to our customers in China and also how we can minimize the impact of the avian flu in many people in China.  And definitely we will see that the avian flu that, in my opinion will also be temporary, will have significant impact in our future revenues.","Operator","","We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs","","Thank you, just a couple of questions.  First, as it relates to sales in Asia Pacific, it did seem to be a little light especially when you adjust for foreign exchange up only 2%, and this is the business that's been growing sort of high single digits, low double digits.  I'm wondering if you can talk about how we should think about that business going forward and the factors that have put some pressure on that.  And also just generally speaking, while I'm interested in your views on your company's companion animal exposure to some of your peers or some of your competitors pushing store brand OTC companion animal products and just where you see exposure in your companion animal business?  Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","","Thank you, Jami.  On the revenues for APAC, so we grew by 2%.  APAC is a combination of two different group of countries.  So we have highly developed markets like Australia, Japan, Korea, and emerging markets India, China, South East Asia.  In the developed markets, we saw in this quarter very strong growth in Australia.  We faced some challenge in Japan and Korea and in emerging markets India also faced some challenge because of some regulatory issues that we expect to solve in the next following quarters and also some time -- one time in China.  We are convinced that APAC will be significant on that growth generator in our total revenues and we expect also in 2013 APAC growing faster than the average for the rest of the regions in Zoetis.  And --","Rick Passov","Jami, I just want to add that the regulatory issues pertained to product delays and are not related to manufacturing or any other part of the network.  It's just taken us a little longer to get some products registered in that market in India.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Rick.  In terms of our exposure in companion animal in OTC, so we see that this segment it's mostly effecting anti-parasitic, and in our case even our anti-parasitic portfolio, its prescription portfolio.  So our revolution in the U.S. it is a problem that requires a prescription of a vet.  So it's not something that is really affected by the OTC.  Definitely the OTC will be a challenge that we'll continue growing, mainly in anti-parasitic and anti-parasitic that will not require the precision of a vet.  The majority of our portfolio, say 95% of our portfolio requires the prescription of a vet.  So, in our opinion, our portfolio is not really affected by this shift from vet clinics to the OTC channel.","Operator","","We'll go next to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Tony Butler - Barclays Capital","","Good morning, thanks very much.  Two brief questions.  One is in the U.S companion Animal is quite strong, you made reference to product coming back on the market.  I assume that's Sentinel related to the Revolution.  Is it fair to assume that's correct?  And more importantly would it also be fair to assume that that competitor would have some sort of promotional campaign underway and I'm interested more importantly about how you counter that, if you will counter that.  And second, in the European market certainly culled out on the 10-K there was very strong growth for parasiticides primarily in the France and U.K.  Rick, you made some comments about the delay due to weather patterns in Europe, and I just like to stress that out a little bit more.  Would that imply that parasiticides would actually be -- so we have less growth on a year-over-year basis, but more importantly how do we think about that for the remainder of the year?  Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","","Thank you, Tony.  And our companion animal business in the U.S., I think on top of this issue of, from some of our competitor, I think it's enjoying very strong momentum.  Definitely we have seen that the competitor now is back in the second quarter and they are applying some promotional strategies and we feel comfortable that our strategies and also our presence and our direct interaction with our customers are the right way really to defend our portfolio.  And that's really it, it will have an impact in the second quarter compared to last year because last year also this competitor was not in the market, but definitely it's something that has been included in our yearly guidance.  So all these elements have been a part of our projections for 2013.  Rick, do you want to make any comment on that?","Rick Passov","Not on that, no.  ","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay, so then in Europe, in France and the U.K.  So in U.K we had the price increase in the first quarter compared to price increase in the second quarter last year.  This can also have an impact in terms of the results of the first quarter.  And what we see also in Europe, not only in France and U.K., in all Europe that the weather has been very cold and has been a delay on the season for ticks and flees.  And definitely this can happen in the second quarter and this can also happen in fact in the total year.  But this has been already incorporated in our projection for the total year.  And any delay in terms of decision for parasiticides seems the animals are normally treated the mostly.  This is something that will have an impact in our quarter, the second quarter, but we expect that the total year projections are the one that is going to be provided to you.  Rick","Rick Passov ","The only thing I would say Tony again is your right that the parasiticides season is important in Europe.  You and we can all see that there's a much colder season in Europe and its delaying the start of the season and we're taking our best guess now of what the impact will be in the guidance that we're providing to you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","","One comment that is also important to remember, it's the international markets. They're closing in February and so the quarter will start March, April, May.  So these are the quarter for international.  While for the U.S. is the natural quarters.","Operator","","And we'll go next to site of Liav Abraham with Citi.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Liav Abraham - Citi","","Hi, good morning.  Two questions please, first, I'd appreciate if you could expand a little on the weakness in the Canada, Latin America region and how you anticipate that paying out for the rest of the year and when you anticipate an acceleration in growth?  And then, secondly, following on from Chris's question earlier on SG&A costs, I have a question on R&D costs and these are also looking relatively flat this year with versus last year.  How should we be thinking about this line item going forward?  Thank you?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Liav, and the business in Canada, Latin America grew by 4%, and this 4% I think it's something that you see in line with our expectations.  So Canada, Latin America, its two big countries.  Canada and Brazil they represent almost two-thirds of the total revenue of the region, and they are both countries which are highly developed in livestock and Canada highly developed also in Companion Animal.  So definitely Brazil, although it's defined as an emerging market is not an emerging market for livestock because it's highly sophisticated in terms of production of animal produce.  So we expect  ","So, we expect this region growing in line with our expectations, and again it will be some fluctuations among quarters, but at the end of the year this region -- and some of the marketing in the region will be generated in stronger growth and maybe Rick you want to cover the question on SG&A and R&D.","Rick Passov","Sure, I think the question was R&D and all I'll say is that's an important part of the value paradigm here that we do think that we can grow revenue faster than all of our expenses.  I would include R&D and that generally be the effect of the this R&D is in part shown by the fact that revenues growing and earnings are growing at a faster pace.","Operator","","We'll go next to Alex Arfeai with BMO Capital Markets.  Go ahead, your line is open.","Alex Arfeai - BMO Capital Markets","","Good morning, thank you for taking the questions and I'll add my congratulations as well.  Two questions, are you seeing increased scrutiny by regulators as a result of recent issues in China, specifically are you seeing increased or do you see the potential for increased restrictions on use of antibiotics in livestock feed?  And then as a follow-up, could you comment on the sustainability of price increases.  My understanding was that a significant portion of your portfolio is subject to cheaper competition.  Is pricing leverage something that we can expect going forward? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","","Thank you, Alex.  Definitely we will see that regulatory standards will increase in all markets where we operate.  We don't see that as a negative to our business because we have already these higher standards that we apply to all the countries that we operate.  Maybe this way we'll facilitate competition in some of the markets in where local producers, they are applying lower standards in terms of manufacturing and regulatory approvals.","In terms of the anti-infective, well, these are the discussions that has been on since many years.  We have a portfolio in anti-infective which is excellent and its gold standards for treating sick animals in all the different species.  And definitely we see that the we will continue collaborating that with many regulators around the world to ensure the right use of anti-infective.  And one example of this collaboration, it\u2019s the recent discussions and agreement with FDA to withdraw the indication for growth promotion of some of our products in the U.S., products which are medically important for human on for this indication.  We expect that that this will have minimal impact in our revenues.","In terms of the sustainability of price increases, 80% of our portfolio is really not patent protected, and this has been the case for many years.  And even with this situation we have been able to increase our prices in a constant way in all different geographies and different species.  So, we are confident that the business model that we have, which is combining direct interaction with customers and high quality of our products and reliable supply will allow us to really to continue applying in price increases in the future.","Operator","We will go next to David Krempa with Morningstar.  Go ahead, your line is open.","","David Krempa - Morningstar","Thanks for taking the call.  I was just wondering if you could elaborate on why you are able to drive such strong operating leverage in Europe with just a little revenue growth but big operational income growth.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, David, and I will ask Rick to answer this question.","","Rick Passov","Well, first of all, thank you for the question.  Basically, from two basic factors, the fact is gross margins in Europe are healthy.  So we get a little bit of leverage in the P&L from growing the top-line and as well there is good expense control on that market.  And then, I would only add that quarter-over-quarter there may be some variability in the rate of earnings growth versus revenue growth.  So nothing really special or outstanding there.","Operator","We will go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.  Go ahead your line is open.","","Ann Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, this is Ann again.  What was cash flow and cash balance for the quarter, and do you have targets there for the year also on CapEx?  And how is inventory management?  Can you give us an outstanding balance and what you consider I guess of this big area of improvement for you going forward?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Ann.  And I will ask Rick to answer these two questions.","","Rick Passov","","Ann, as you know in our release today, we did not release balance sheet or cash flow, you will see that when we publish our 10-Q.  Otherwise, we have said that in 2013 our priorities are going to be completing the separation, the elevated spend associated with that, paying our dividend.  And that I do not expect significant working capital improvements this year in part because our primary focus is again all of those activities to complete the separation.  And those activities include, a significant amount of product transfers and that affects our ability in this particular year to make a sole concentration on reducing inventory levels.  But in general, I think you would see not a deterioration of working capital and that become a focus for us in the out years.","","Operator","And we have a follow-up form David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.

Just -- I think you are not giving quarterly guidance but anything you can talk through on quarterly progression from here just so we have kind of no surprises.  I guess even at the high level, how are you thinking about stronger of weaker quarters the rest of this year based on what you can see today?  Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And Chris, thank you for the question.  And what we want really it's to insist that our business should really assess on a yearly basis, that there will be some fluctuations on quarters.  We have stronger quarter in Q1.  There was some one-time items in this quarter.  And we will see that some of these items will also have a impact in following the quarter.  But rather than providing a specific guidance by quarter, we prefer that you consider or assess our business on a yearly basis, because of so many factors that it can really have an influence in our quarters but that can be compensated at the end of the year.  Rick, you want to answer any other question.","Rick Passov","No, I think, Chris, we have done the best job we think we can do in the comments we made on the call, as well as and what is in our press release.","Dina Fede","Operator, time for one more question perhaps.","","Operator","We have one last question it is a follow-up from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.  Go ahead, your line is open.","","Kevin Ellich - Piper Jaffray","Hey, guy just one quick follow-up.  Not to beat a dead horse here but with the drought impact in US, I was wondering if you would give us any specifics as to what is embedded in your guidance?  Last year, we were hearing that herd sizes were down about 5%, now may be 7% of 9% is that what is embedded in our guidance?","","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","I think definitely the drought has been having the highest impact in the cattle business that the herd has been reduced compared to previous year, but it has been also -- now, it is the lowest inventory of animals in the cattle ever.  And these are definitely having an impact in our reactions that has been incorporated in our guidance today.","The cattle will take longer to recover because it takes two to three years to really build the herd, but at the same time, poultry and swine will have a much faster recovery because swine is six month, the cycle, in the case of poultry 45 days.  So, we expect that in the second part of the year, these two species swine and poultry will be back to normal situation and for cattle it will take longer.  But at the same time, we expect that the because of the low inventory also the value of the animals will be higher and the amount that producer will spend for animal will be also higher to protect the health of these animals.  So everything has been included in our guidance and we expect that at the end of year we will have -- we'll be back to normal situation.","So with that I like to thank you everyone for joining us today.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I will start today by describing some of the dynamics in the animal health industry that are on Investors minds. First, is a positive strength for spending an innovation in companion animal medicines and treatments. Pet owners spending in the U.S. continued to rise in terms of our revenue per visit and number of patient medicines. And we also see positive trends for our pet care in the rest of the world.","Pet owners are willing to spend their income on medicines, vaccines, and other treatment to ensure a longer and better quality of life for their pets. We believe Zoetis is well-positioned to continue success in the companion animal space as our portfolio of dermatology products, parasiticides, and vaccines continue to drive our growth.","Second, we see economic pressure, and other challenges continue to impact dairy and cattle producers in the U.S. We still, however, expect to see the U.S. cattle and dairy market growing for a full-year, driven by stronger domestic demand for beef and increasingly optimistic outlook for beef and dairy export and a modest improvement in milk prices.","Finally, African Swine Fever has made headlines about significant concerns for the pork market. It is impacting producer in China with some reports saying that as many as 150 million to 200 million pigs or up to 30% of their annual food supply will be lost due to the outbreak. For context, that is more than the U.S. annual core production.","This situation has far-reaching implications for the global pork supply chain. The reduction in supply in China is making the pigs more valuable, creating opportunities for greater export from other countries, and increasing consumption of other products. The situation will evolve through the year, clearly monitoring any effect on the overall market and our business, which show an impact in the first quarter.","This type of outbreaks, unfortunately are part of doing business in animal health. This year, we are facing issues with African swine fever. A few years ago, we built with PEDV with avian flu, and before with Bruton disease. These challenges are why Zoetis has built a diverse portfolio of best-in-class products across all relevant species and geographies.","A more aggressive opportunities and manage through economic cycles, these things outbreak and integral weather conditions. We congregated in February that we expected the overall industry to grow approximately 5% for the year, excluding the impact of foreign currency. Now, because of African swine fever, we think the animal health industry will have a lower growth rate in 2019 and will continue to assess the broader impact of African swine fever as the year progresses.","Despite some of these temporary challenges, we are maintaining our guidance for operational revenue growth. Excluding Abaxis, 4.5% to 6.5% for the full-year, which we expect to refractor than the growth of the animal health market.","Turning now to our first quarter results. We are off to a solid start for the year with 11% operational revenue growth being driven by our companion animal business. Revenue from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 5 percentage points of the overall 11% growth. Our sales in companion animal products are once again leading the way with 27% operational growth based on the addition of sales from Abaxis, as well as our parasiticides and key dermatology portfolio.","Our livestock products sales declined [3%] operationally due to challenge in certain cattle and swine markets. For the first quarter, we grew our adjusted net income by 18% operationally, and adjusted diluted EPS by 19% as we benefitted from a strong revenue growth and a significant increase in gross margin, due to pricing, our favorable product mix and cost improvements. Glenn will provide more details on our first quarter performance in his remarks.","Our results once again confirm the importance and value for growth and innovative portfolio in the animal health industry, and we remain confident in our performance and outlook for the full-year. Looking ahead, we continue to invest in advancing our pipeline, ensuring careful market launches of new products and furthering the integration of Abaxis this year. Since our last quarterly earnings announcement, we have seen key companion animal products, including Cytopoint and Simparica for dogs, and Revolution Plus for cats continue to gain approvals in markets outside the U.S.","Our Core EQ Innovator, the first and only combination vaccine to offer protection against five core equine diseases, was also approved in Canada. Last week, Zoetis received approval for Apoquel in China, one of Zoetis\u2019 largest companion animal markets and we expect to launch the product there within the next three months. ","On the livestock side, we launched Clarifide Plus for Jersey cattle in the U.S., this is the first genomic test for this breed that provides a direct indication about the genetic risk factors for seven of the most common and costly adult cow diseases. In terms of our R&D pipeline, we still anticipate launching this year a new injectable parasiticide formulation to protect dogs against heartworm for up to 12 months pending FDA approval.","Our new three-way combination parasiticides, composed of Simparica and two other active ingredients still in regulatory review in the U.S. and with European Medicines Agency. Reviews are also underway in Canada and Brazil with further vision expected in Japan, China, and Australia this year. If approved, we anticipate this product will come into market in 2020.","We also continue working on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats and dermatology for cats. Those programs are progressing and we\u2019ll keep investors informed of future finding in this area. We feel very positive about the benefits, this treatment can provide to greater compliance, convenience, and efficacy for different species. In the case of other research or livestock, I would point to our programs in vector vaccine technology for our poultry.","Research into promising new classes of antibiotics and our growing investment in diagnostics, genetics, devices, digital and data analytics technology that can be used in applications like precision livestock farming. Additionally, we have vaccine programs to address current and future emerging diseases, which has been a growth driver for our industry in the past.","We also maintain a comprehensive portfolio of approximately 300 product lines for Zoetis and we invest significantly each year on life cycle innovation that keep those products competitive and growing. ","Finally, we are making good progress on the integration of Abaxis. We remain positive on the point-of-care diagnostic market. Given this strong global growth prospect as well as the critical growth, these diagnostics play in the vet clinic. We are excited about the strength of the Abaxis portfolio and the way our field force is representing it to customers around the world.","Our U.S. imports has been working to drive greater growth through new lead generation for diagnostics. In international markets, we have nearly completed staffing and training of our expanding diagnostic team, implemented a new customer service model across these markets and view this as a greenfield opportunity for future growth.","We are pleased with our progress to-date and we continue to view 2019 as an important year for the integration and platform setting, enhancing certain product and customer experiences and developing more progress essentially for customer solutions that leverage our new diagnostic assets.","Including our first quarter results, once again, demonstrate the stability and the diversed strength of our portfolio in a dynamic animal health industry. We are executing on our strategies for growth across the continuum of care with new products and solutions that help our customers, predict, prevent, detect and treat diseases in animals while navigating the evolving trends in animal health. And we are investing and making important progress in key areas such as dermatology, but I think besides diagnostic, digital and data analytics, where we see both near and long-term growth opportunities.","Thank you for joining us today, and I will now hand the call over to Glenn. Glenn?","Glenn David","Thank you, Juan Ramon and good morning. As Juan Ramon noted, 2019 is off to a solid start. Operational revenue growth was 11% and operational adjusted net income growth was 18%. Reported revenue growth for the first quarter was 7% with a 4% unfavorable impact in foreign exchange, driven primarily by currency depreciation of the Euro and Brazilian Real. ","Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational growth for the quarter was 6%. Included in the 6% growth is, 4% price, and 2% volume. Volume growth includes contributions from key dermatology of 2% and new products of 1%, which were partially offset by declines in other in-line products of 1%. Companion animal demonstrated continued strength this quarter with legacy Abaxis products, parasiticides and key dermatology products leading the growth with positive contributions from all key markets.","Meanwhile, livestock declined in the quarter based upon declines in sales of Medicaid feed additives and challenges like the African swine fever outbreak in China. Our overall results in the first quarter continued to demonstrate the value of the diversified portfolio with double-digit operational growth despite the declines in swine and cattle. Legacy Abaxis products contributed 5% to total Zoetis' operational revenue growth in the quarter with sales of $61 million.","As a reminder, the acquisition of Abaxis was completed in the third quarter of 2018, so sales from legacy Abaxis products are incremental in the first half of 2019. The revenue this quarter represented a decline over the pro forma revenue from the prior year. This decline is primarily driven by new product launches and initial distributor stocking in the first quarter last year.","We continue to expect full-year growth in diagnostics products as we focus on improving customer experience, connectivity to practice management software and international expansion. Our key dermatology portfolio comprised of APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, also continued to contribute to growth this quarter with sales of $155 million, a 30% operational increase over the prior year.","New products, including Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as it's called internationally. PCV combo vaccines in swine and Core EQ Innovator in equine were also growth drivers in the quarter. Revolution Plus, a topical parasiticide for cats builds upon the sarolaner compound that is found in Simparica. The product launched in the US this quarter and in 2017 internationally and is off to a great start supporting strong growth in the Revolution-Stronghold line in the first quarter.","The decline in other in-line product volume was related to the timing of cattle product purchases in the U.S., African swine fever in China, the divestiture of certain agribusiness products in Japan, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the implementation of stricter commercial and pricing policies in Brazil. The agribusiness is historically seasonal with a disproportionate sales in the first quarter.","These declines were partially offset by the continued strength of Simparica now captured in the in-line product category, which generated $48 million in global sales this quarter, representing operational growth of 61% over last year.","Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for Q1. U.S. revenue grew 13% in the first quarter. Companion animal grew 30% and was partially offset by a 7% decline in livestock. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 8%. Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, in-line products, including our key dermatology portfolio and Simparica and new products, including Revolutions Plus.","Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 20%. U.S. dermatology sales were $104 million for the quarter, growing 26%, driven by market share gains, price, and investments in direct-to-consumer advertising, which continue to expand the market. Simparica sales in the quarter was $25 million, growing 40% over the prior year. ","U.S. livestock declined 7% driven by cattle and swine. Cattle was impacted by the timing of Medicaid feed additive purchases and they are continuing to face headwinds while producer profitability remained low. Swine was impacted by the discontinuation of a promotional program for our premium products and the timing of medicated feed additive purchases.","The declines in cattle and swine were partially offset by another strong quarter for poultry, driven by growth of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. Despite the decline this quarter, we continue to anticipate U.S. livestock will grow for the full-year.","Turning now to our International segment. Revenue grew 7% operationally in the first quarter. Companion animal operational growth was 23%, while livestock declined 1% operationally. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, International revenue grew 5%. Companion animal product growth was driven by continued expansion and uptake of key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products, strong Simparica sales, and growth in China. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 18%.","Livestock declines were driven by the impact of African swine fever in China and the divestiture of certain agribusiness products in Japan, which were partially offset by growth in poultry, fish, and sheep. The complete quarterly results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the tables included in our earnings release, but I would like to highlight a few items for the quarter.","The UK had operational revenue growth of 16% in the quarter with companion animal growing 21% and livestock growing 11%. Companion animal growth was primarily related to legacy Abaxis products and increased sales of key dermatology products and Simparica. Livestock benefited from increased market share in agricultural vaccine in the quarter.","In Australia, sales grew 10% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 15%, and livestock growth of 6%. This market benefited from key dermatology, legacy Abaxis products and Simparica and companion animal, while livestock growth was related to key brand performance in cattle.","In Brazil, sales grew 1% operationally, driven by companion animal growth of 43%, partially offset by livestock declines of 13%. Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by parasiticides, primarily Simparica and continued strength of Apoquel. Livestock declines in cattle for Brazil related to the strengthening of our commercial and pricing policies, which impacted short-term results. We anticipate these policy updates will strengthen our long-term opportunity in this market. Overall market dynamics remain positive as does our full-year outlook.","Moving on to China, we had a challenging quarter with revenue declining 2% operationally. Livestock declined 28%, driven by challenges in swine. African swine fever is having a greater than expected impact as the outbreak has worsened in China, reducing the size of the swine herd. We continue to expect other regions, primarily the EU, Brazil and the U.S., to increase exports of pork to China to meet domestic consumer demand.","We also anticipate growth in other proteins, although to a lesser degree. Companion animal remain strong, partially offsetting the livestock decline with operational growth of 38% driven by continued growth of vaccines, parasiticides and an expansion of the field force in China, allowing us to capitalize on this fast-growing market.","As Juan Ramon mentioned, we're also very excited about the launch of Apoquel into this important market. Other emerging and developed markets also continued to perform well this quarter, particularly in companion animal. Summarizing international performance, continued growth of key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products, and diversity across our portfolio, all contributed to a solid quarter despite challenges in livestock.","Now, moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.2% increased approximately 270 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, compared to the prior year. The improvement this quarter is primarily related to price, favorable product mix, foreign exchange and unit cost improvements, partially offset by the inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio.","We do anticipate a more normalized gross margin in the second quarter as both price and mix impact will moderate. Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition grew 8% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and an increase of certain compensation-related expenses. We are anticipating higher expenses in the second quarter, primarily related to the timing of promotional investments for our key products, the timing of R&D project spend, and the Abaxis integration.","We are continuing with direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional campaigns in the U.S. that support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with our highest expenses occurring in Q2 and Q3. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%. The increase from the comparable 2018 period is predominantly related to the impact of the global intangible low taxed income or GILTI tax, which is a provision of the U.S. tax reform, that\u2019s effective for Zoetis in 2019.","Our expectation for the full-year adjusted effective tax rate is consistent with initial guidance, which is between 20% and 21%. The favorability in the first quarter is primarily driven by the tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 18% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, favorability in gross margin, and moderated growth in operating expenses. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 19% operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2018.","Now, moving on to guidance for the full-year. Beginning with revenue, we are decreasing both the low end and high end of the range by $75 million to reflect the impact of foreign exchange. As I noted on the fourth quarter call, U.S. dollar strengthening was something we will be monitoring, and additional USD strengthening has occurred since we set guidance. ","We\u2019re now projecting revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.225 billion, while maintaining operational revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2018. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, is projected to be between 4.5% and 6.5%, consistent with the guidance provided in February. Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is still expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%.","As I noted earlier, there were some favorable drivers in the first quarter that we expect to moderate through the remainder of the year. We are decreasing the low and high-ends of the range for adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion, due to the impact of foreign exchange.","Moving on to R&D. We expect 2019 expenses to be between $445 million and $465 million, consistent with the guidance provided in February. Full year adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $200 million compared to the previous estimate of $220 million. The favorability is largely driven by a reduction in interest expense. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20% to 21%, consistent with previous guidance, and we are still projecting adjusted net income in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion, maintaining 8% to 11% operational growth.","With a more limited foreign exchange impact on the bottom line, as well as the benefits of the actions we've taken to reduce interest expense, we continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52, consistent with previous guidance. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.79 -- $2.93, however, is a reduction of both the low and high-ends of the range based upon increased certain significant items, primarily due to a change in estimate related to inventory costing impacting the first quarter.","Finally, I'd like to remind you that our quarterly results may fluctuate and our focus continues to be on the full-year. As I've already noted, we anticipate lower gross margin and higher operating expense in the second quarter, which will impact adjusted EPS. The full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition will also continue to have a disproportionate impact on the P&L until we pass the acquisition date in the middle of the third quarter. Finally, foreign exchange will continue to negatively impact the P&L in the second quarter with an impact of approximately 300 basis points to revenue growth.","Now, to summarize before we move to Q&A. Our first quarter results continue to demonstrate the value of our geographic and product diversity with operational revenue growth of 11% and operational adjusted net income growth of 18%. We continue to see strength in our companion animal portfolio to drive the year's results and expect growth in livestock for the full-year. And we remain committed to delivering on our full-year operational growth rate for revenue and adjusted net income, demonstrating the durability and consistency of our business.","Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Erin Wright","Hi, thank you. Can you discuss a little bit how the Abaxis integration is progressing here relative to your internal expectations? It was a little lighter than what we thought in our Abaxis model and is that just the distributor dynamic, and I noticed that the GAAP acquisition related cost takes a little bit higher, is that all attributable to Abaxis and where we stand with it as the key implementation? And then the second question is on international livestock, just given some of the dynamics around African swine fever and what you called out in Brazil, can you speak to how we should think about that quarterly progression over the course of the year? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Erin. Let me answer the question on Abaxis, and let me first say that we are pleased with the progress that we're making with the integration of Abaxis. The team in the U.S. is already working well, maybe not fully integrating the two portfolios because we mentioned that these have full integration, we need also to work with the integration of SAP. And related to the implementation of SAP for Abaxis, we have decided to move the implementation from August-September to February, because we want our IT team to focus on working on the connectivity of all equipment of Abaxis.","We think that this connectivity that we expect to penalize by the end of the year will help us really to have that much more support to diagnostics and offer full integration or full connectivity of the diagnostic equipment to the practice management system. We\u2019re also pleased with the progress that we are making in International markets. We have now almost completed all the hiring process for reps and also for technical support. We have also said the customer service that would help in really to provide the support to diagnostic customers.","So, in general, we are progressing very well. We continue \u2013 very excited about the quality of the portfolio of Abaxis, and we are very confident that Abaxis will represent a significant growth opportunity, especially from 2020. Now we see 2020 \u2013 2019 as a year where we are integrating, we are fixing some of the things that we have to identify from the previews Abaxis model, and we are very confident that the projections that we have for this portfolio will be very positive.","In terms of the international livestock, let me provide a comment on Brazil and then I will ask Glenn to go into more details on what we expect for the rest of the year in the total livestock performance. In Brazil, we see that the market that continue growing very fast. It's a very strong growth for Zoetis. So, the growth in companion animal is above market growth, so we are growing very fast.","In cattle, we decided to change some of our commercial policies, including prices, and we saw as expected some negative reaction from distribution. This had an impact in the first quarter for Brazil, especially in cattle, but we are convinced that these changes will help us in generating better future growth and improve the profitability of our cattle operations in Brazil. So, we remain very convinced that Brazil will be a growth driver for Zoetis, and we are investing to support this growth on that.","Glenn, do you mind to provide more details on the International livestock?","Glenn David","Absolutely. Erin, just also to your question on Abaxis and the Q1 performance you referenced, distributor stocking. So far, we talked about the performance in Q1 2019 to Q1 2018. In Q1 2018, there was stocking with the introduction of the new products in terms your settlement analyzer and Apoquel rapid test, that did pose a challenging comp between Q1 2019 and Q1 2018.","In terms of the international livestock performance, as Juan Ramon said, for livestock internationally we declined about 1% this quarter, driven by the factors that we discussed in terms of African swine fever, as well as the impact in Brazil. We would expect to return to growth in Q2, and that growth to accelerate in Q3 and Q4.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi. Thanks for taking my question here. So, I wanted to ask you about your temporary weakness in livestock and when do you expect that to subside this year and then return to growth, and how much of that is macro versus company specific? And then maybe just if you could talk a little bit more about this MSA buyer pattern? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Well, as we said that in the first quarter, we faced two impacts in terms of the temporary weakness in livestock. One was the cattle business in the U.S. was affected by different factors. And talking about the market, the market declined. We saw that the movement of animals was below expectations. In many cases, driven by weather conditions, but we are optimistic about the cattle business in the U.S. moving forward, the demand for beef is positive, and also the exports are increasing.","Additionally, we expect also in the second half of the year a small increase on the price of the milk also that will help the total cattle business in the U.S. As many times we mentioned, I think it is difficult to analyze our business in a quarterly basis. There are fluctuations based on buying patterns and promotional activities weather conditions that maybe it's important to understand the business on a yearly basis. We remain confident that the livestock market will be growing at the end of the year. What we are expecting is that the poultry will be growing in line or slightly ahead of the market.","In terms of swine, we expect going lower than the market, and mainly because of the African swine fever. But we expect having a temporary impact, but maybe from a third or fourth quarter and definitely in 2020, we expect a significant recovery because many markets outside of China will expand the production that will generate a significant growth.","And finally, with the cattle, we also expect that for the year overall growing \u2013 we expect growing in the U.S., we expect also growing international markets, but growing below expected market growth.","Glenn David","And in terms of the timing of the MSA purchases in the U.S., that's really related to the timing of our annual price increases. So, in 2019, we align the timing of our MSA price increases to be in sync with the rest of our portfolio, which is in January, that led to some additional sales in Q4 of 2018 that then destocked in Q1 of 2019. So that is not an impact that we would expect to see as we move forward through the rest of the year.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Hi, Juan Ramon. Just have a couple of questions here. Companion animal continues to be really strong. You're seeing really good growth out of obviously the dermatology portfolio, but also Revolution Plus for cats compared to the dogs, could you talk about what areas you're focused with the product development, maybe more on the feline side in the areas that are being medicalized. Also timing for the monoclonal antibody products. And then Glenn, on the SG&A and operating expenses, clearly there were some favorability this quarter. And you talked about increased spending, DTC campaign in Q2. Could you give us a little bit more color on that? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Kevin, we see the current portfolio still showing opportunities for growth. We see opportunities for growing the parasiticides now with Revolution Plus. We still see that Simparica continues gaining momentum in the U.S. and also international markets. Apoquel and CYTOPOINT are growing and we expect to continue growing. We expect to continue growing in the U.S. and also expect to continue growing in international markets. And now, we have the addition of Apoquel in China, that also will support this growth.","We are also very confident that this growth is steady for the long-term, because as we said, the current portfolio continue growing, but we expect also to introduce Simparica or a combination of products \u2013 three-way products in 2020, that also we expect that to continue generating growth.","In the future, we are not at this point providing any details of when we expect that monoclonal antibodies to be in the market. But definitely we see opportunities in reline with pain. We see opportunities also in feline with dermatology, again with monoclonal antibodies, and always with monoclonal antibodies in dogs for pain. And we are very confident that the R&D machine will continue bringing innovation to the market in companion animals, but also in livestock.","We have products for both companion animal and livestock that will support growth in 2020, 2021, also 2022. So, we are very confident that we have a pipeline that will maintain growth that will be in line or faster than the market. And Glenn will respond the question on G&A.","Glenn David","Kevin, in terms of the operating expenses. So, just for the quarter, our operating expenses grew about 8%. If you back out Abaxis, operating expenses grew around 3%, compared to our revenue growth of 6%. So, pretty much in line with our overall expectations over an extended period of time. That being said, we did have some favorability in R&D expenses in terms of the timing as well. So, as we move through into Q2 and Q3, we'd expect elevated expenses in Q2 and Q3 as that is the time frame in which our DTC promotions, particularly in the U.S. around our dermatology portfolio and Simparica to kick in at a higher level. And we'd also expect some elevated expenses in terms of our R&D as well.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple \u2013 I want to dig deeper on some of the moving pieces in the quarter both on the livestock markets in the U.S. and internationally. If I sort of go through some of the items you called out African swine fever, the spend, divestment, looking at your revenues by geography, I think I can estimate that ASF may have had a $5 million to $10 million hit in the quarter. The Japan divestment is somewhere in the same ballpark as well. So, I want to get a sense of if that's the right way to think about it? And then is that the similar run rate you would expect for ASF going forward? And then the other one would on the U.S. livestock business. You talked a little bit about the distributor relationship in the stocking in 4Q, but just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of that impact in the first quarter versus the rest of the feedlot pressures as well, so we could plan the phase through the course of the year? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Mike. I will make a general comment on the African swine fever. Then Glenn will go to the details of your questions. So, first, the African swine fever definitely is having a significant impact in China, and we also have an impact in our results. We mentioned that probably up to 30% of pigs would be lost on 150 million to 200 million. And as a reference, in the U.S., production is 120 million per year. But it's also true that in China, the market share of multinational company is only 10%, 90% is products sold by local companies.","We definitely see a significant issue in China, mainly for the business in China cattle, so we see that the other countries, the U.S., Brazil, European markets will increase significantly the production of pork to meet all the demands of the Chinese consumers that are definitely for a significant period of time. There will be seen a shortfall for producing in China. And it seems outside of China, we have a significant market share in swine.","In the medium and long-term, we see that as an opportunity to generate growth in swine and also maybe an impact in poultry and to a minor extent also to beef. Because in the end, the consumption of animal products in China will remain and export markets will supply products to meet that demand in the markets. And then Glenn will go through the details of the impact on African swine fever in the quarter and also the Japan agro business and also the U.S. impact of the value.","Glenn David","So, Mike, specific to your questions, for ASF and Japan, you mentioned the range of $5 million to $10 million. So, what I'd say, ASF is probably at the high end of the range for the quarter and Japan is probably at the low end of that range for the quarter. In terms of U.S. livestock, obviously we did have the impact in Q1. It's a little above that $5 million to $10 million range that you referenced with the bigger portion of that being cattle.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","Pardon me. Thanks guys, good morning. I've got two long ones. Maybe I'll try to break it up if it's okay with you. The first one is triple or Simparica Trio, any updates on how the filing or interaction with the agency is proceeding? and I'm just curious in your ability to fulfill demand in the early days, obviously with Apoquel there were challenges post launch although, I know some of that was sort of the reliance on a third-party manufacturer. So, any color would be helpful. And then I'll ask a quicker follow up. Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Jon. And we have provision with the discussions with the FDA. We have completed out all the sections of the filing and it's just now the normal process of question and answers. We are confident that this year it's strong and it will be approved by the FDA, but always something that is not depending on us but on the regulators. But one of the challenges that we discussed in the past is that we needed to demonstrate 100% efficacy on how we have to provide these data.","And we are confident that \u2013 probably that will be approved and ready to be launched in 2020. And definitely we try to learn from previous challenge or issues or mistakes, and definitely in the case of the three-way products, we secured enough active ingredients to be ready for launch the product, as soon as the product is approved. So, we are not expecting any challenge in terms of supplying the market or the demand. Next question.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Thank you very much. So, I have three questions, please. First, with respect to U.S. companion growth this quarter, could you just give us the figure, the percentage ex-Abaxis? Second, how should we model livestock sequentially in the second quarter? I just don't have a good feel for how we should think \u2013 thinking about the livestock business sequentially in 2Q in the U.S. and ex-U.S. And then, one little tidbit, with respect to the revenue guidance reduction of 1%, was that solely related to FX or was there also some modest impact elsewhere? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Dave. And Glenn will cover these three questions.","Glenn David","Sure. So, just in those questions. In terms of our revenue growth excluding Abaxis focused on companion animal, so globally our companion animal business grew 27%. Without Abaxis we still grew extremely strong at 19% globally. In the U.S., the number was \u2013 with Abaxis we grew 30%, excluding Abaxis we grew 20%, and internationally companion animal grew 23%. Without Abaxis, we grew 18%. So, really strong organic growth within our U.S. companion business.","As we mentioned earlier, in terms of the livestock growth sequentially, when you look at it globally, we did decline 3% this quarter in terms of livestock business on an operational basis. We do expect to return to growth in Q2, and we expect that growth to accelerate throughout the year.","In terms of the guidance, we reduced the guidance for both the low and high end of the range by $75 million, that was purely due to FX. There were significant movements at the time from when we set guidance. When we set guidance back in February, we were using rates as of late January, and when we set guidance now, we're using rates as of the end of \u2013 towards the end of April, and that had a significant movement, so the movement was purely due to FX.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take the next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for John Kreger. So, just a quick question surrounding the dermatology portfolio. When you just think about like the penetration rates specifically in the U.S. right now, where do you guys kind of think that is? And then when you think about the international growth in the dermatology portfolio for the rest in 2019 and beyond, where do you guys foresee that going? And then just when you think about them individually, so Apoquel and CYTOPOINT, have they trended \u2013 have they trended well, compared to your expectations and are you seeing that's having like a strong preference for one or the other products? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","In terms of penetration for dermatology portfolio, I think it's \u2013 it's about \u2013 in terms of patient, about 59% and it's something that probably \u2013 63%, sorry, it's the total patient share, which is based on and we still see opportunities first to continue expanding the market and we will be starting now in the second quarter campaign \u2013 detectable tumor campaign. We set two objectives, one it's expanded market. And also, second is set to continue building brand equity for Apoquel.","We see also that these investments are also having a positive impact on CYTOPOINT. We expect dermatology portfolio to continue growing. We expect also to grow faster in international markets than in the U.S., but in the U.S., we still see a positive momentum, and how much is the preferential CYTOPOINT or Apoquel?","In that respect, I think we leave veterinarians to decide what is the best for their patients, the pets. And we are not trying that to promote Apoquel in favor of CYTOPOINT, and CYTOPOINT in favor of Apoquel. We are covering all the spectrum of needs in terms of treating dermatology issues, itching in dogs, and that we see that there is [indiscernible] cannibalization, but also CYTOPOINT has been growing the market and helping us increase this franchise. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to with Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy Miner","Thank you. Good morning. I've two questions. First, could you just provide a little more clarification on your comments about the impacts of the African swine fever on Zoetis, and I appreciate that over time there is going to be a greater demand for the proteins or will see other regions pick-up some of the supply? Can you just help us understand why that's medium to long-term and why shouldn't we see some of those dynamics sooner, particularly as supply needs to pick-up in some other countries? And my second question is on Apoquel. First, could you give us the breakdown between CYTOPOINT and Apoquel sales of 155 million you gave us before? And also, in Apoquel in China, could you give us a sense of the market size, is it similar to the EU5 or U.S. and is CYTOPOINT also under review in China? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you for all the questions, Kathy. So, let's go back to the African swine fever and the potential impact. We mentioned that we expect that up to 30% of pigs can be blocked because of the African swine fever in China. So, if we translate this 30% to our revenues in \u2013 so we can also estimate that it will be about 30% of our revenues. Although we expect a little bit lower impact because of maybe sophisticated farms are less affected by the African swine fever, then the production of small farms.","We expect that that it will be an immediate impact in terms of the value of the pigs. As a reference, in the last quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2018, producers in the U.S., they were losing $20 per pig, now they making $30 profit per pig. So, the value of the pigs has increasing significantly, and then their willingness to spend and to keep these pigs healthy and productive also will increase. So, we expect that that will be a positive impact, an immediate positive impact.","Then, we expect also that the farmers or producers in U.S., Brazil, European Union will increase production. The cycle of the production is six months. But probably we will need to wait six months to see some impact because it will increase the production. And even that if it takes six months from birth to slaughter, I think we can start using products at earlier stage of the animal.","So, we expect in the third and the fourth quarters of this year having a positive impact in the swine business in Brazil, U.S., and U.S. market. And moving into the details of Apoquel breakout, Glenn, do you mind answering that? And also, probably those projections in China and providing some context.","Glenn David","Sure. So, in terms of the total derm revenue, we had $155 million in total sales for the quarter with growth of 30%. To the earlier question, in terms of penetration, U.S. had $104 million in sales and international had around $52 million. So, as the similar amount of medicalized dogs in the U.S. is international, we would expect more rapid growth from international greater penetration over time internationally.","The breakout of $155 million between Apoquel and CYTOPOINT. We had $119 million of sales of Apoquel with 22% operational growth, and we had $36 million of sales in CYTOPOINT with 65% operational growth. In terms of Apoquel in China, we\u2019re very excited about the launch of Apoquel in China, China is one of our largest and fastest growing companion animal markets. Just to put in context though, the overall potential market size.","So, in 2018, Apoquel globally in all of our international markets, including the U.S., have less than $160 million in sales with our top market internationally generating sales of just below $30 million. So that should give some overall context in terms of the potential of Apoquel in any given international large companion animal market.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions, maybe first on Simparica Trio. Just a little bit more color about how were thinking about the launch of these new triples, how quickly they'll be adopted. Should we be thinking about these as products that could have significant year one uptake or is this a more gradual kind of three to five-year process as these roll out? The second question, I know it's been touched on a little bit, but your companion business, particularly in the U.S. companion business were particularly strong in the quarter and above recent trend, just elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing here, and if there's anything with either one-time related or either kind of year-over-year timing related in terms of the strength we saw this quarter. Just trying to get a sense of how much of this is just really healthy organic kind of underlying growth versus timing issues? Thanks so much.","JUAN RAMON ALAIX","First, starting with the combination of product for parasiticides. Well, their options, I think we expect their options would be fast and also will depend. If we are number three, number two or number one in the market, but definitely we see a need for the market to combine internal and parasiticides mainly in dogs. And we are confident that we have significant opportunity to generate growth in 2020, 2021 and also 2022, because we think that that is \u2013 this probably will have a long run, and definitely the opportunity is really to generate our growth in companion animal. And Glenn will talk about the U.S. companion animal growth in the quarter and the trends for the future.","Glenn David","Yes. So, what I would say Chris is, the overall global compatible growth was very strong. When you take out the impact of Abaxis, we grew 19%, 20% in the U.S., 18% internationally. So, both segments growing very rapidly in companion animal, and those are driven just by strong underlying dynamics and trends, particularly around the derm portfolio around Simparica and also really strong performance of Revolution Plus. Q1 of 2019 was the launch of Revolution Plus in the U.S., it's off to a very successful start. There is some stocking in Q1 of 2019, particularly in the U.S., but still the start that we're seeing in Revolution Plus is very, very encouraging.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Glenn. Net question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Greg Fraser with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Greg Fraser","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. As [indiscernible] that as livestock business was impacted by destocking related consolidation in the distributor space, that's something that you've observed, I wasn't sure of your comment on distributor purchasing patterns, which related to what they described, and just a quick follow-up on the livestock commentary, are you anticipating growth for international for the full year? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Probably we still have some challenge with distribution in Brazil, but not in the U.S. In Brazil, I mentioned that we have these changes in the commercial policies that reviews sales to distribution during the quarter. But as I mentioned, we expect that this will support more quality growth in the future, but no changes in the distribution in the U.S. So, Glenn, do you want to add comments here?","Glenn David","No, just to your question on livestock growth for the full year. We still are expecting livestock to grow globally in the U.S. and internationally.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We will take today's final question from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.","Prakhar Agrawal","Hi. This is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of many Navin Jacob. Two questions, please. First, on poultry, your growth in poultry products was quite strong. So, could you give more color on what is driving that in terms of the near-term trends and anything specific from your product portfolio? And secondly, one of your competitors recently made an acquisition that included some oncology products, so is Zoetis making an R&D investment in oncology and do you think this market is commercially attractive? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","I will ask Glenn to answer the question on poultry and then I will cover the oncology part of the question.","Glenn David","So, from a poultry perspective, we continue to perform very well in poultry. Overall, very solid growth, higher than the rest of our portfolio livestock, and really that's driven by our portfolio of alternative to antibiotics in poultry that we continue to perform very well within the MSA sector. So that's something that's been consistent for us over the last number of quarters and trend that we expect to continue.","Juan Ramon Alaix","And on oncology, we have already a product in oncology. She is working well, which is a [indiscernible]. We launched this product some years ago. We continue assessing the oncology market, then definitely we have some programs \u2013 internal programs related to monoclonal antibody and some of the products such that still oncology is very limited by market although maybe in the future it will be a potential attractive market. But today, it's a quietly with that opportunity.","And I think, that concludes the questions, and thank you very much for joining us today. And as we said, we remain very confident about the outlook for 2019 and we are maintaining our operational growth, and we are also maintaining our target in terms of adjusted net income. Thank you very much for your attendance.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thank for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"23257":["Zoetis Inc.

And welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast for Zoetis. Hosting the call today is Steve Frank, Vice President of Investor Relations for Zoetis.","The presentation materials and additional financial tables are currently posted on the Investor Relations section of zoetis.com. The presentation slides can be managed by you the viewer and will not be forwarded automatically. In addition, a replay of this call will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call via dial-in or on the Investor Relations section at zoetis.com.","At this time, all participants are placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and then queue up again with any follow-ups. Your line will be muted when you complete your question [Operator Instructions].","It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.","Steve Frank","Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings call. I am joined today by Kristin Peck, our Chief Executive Officer and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our Web site and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections.","For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, February 13, 2020. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kristin.","Kristin Peck","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. By now, you read our press release and financial tables on the Zoetis Web site, so I\u2019ll take just a few minutes to recap the full year, talk about outlook for 2020 and outline some of the long term investment plans and growth opportunities we see for our Zoetis. Our CFO, Glenn David, will then cover the fourth quarter and our full year guidance for 2020, before we open the lines up for your questions.","So let's get started. Zoetis delivered another year of strong growth and market leadership in 2019. Thanks to our diverse and durable portfolio and our commitment to continuous innovation. We grew revenue 10% operationally, which includes about 2% of growth from the Abaxis acquisition. This is once again above the market growth for animal health. We just expect it to be about 3% to 4% for 2019, reflecting the negative impact of African swine fever. We grew our adjusted net income faster than revenue at 14% operationally, continuing to achieve our goal of growing from profitability faster than revenue over the long term.","In terms of other elements of our value proposition, we achieved several new approvals in areas that will strengthen our traditional portfolio of parasiticides and vaccine and we invested in critical acquisitions and partnerships that will accelerate our growth in areas where we are expanding, such as diagnostics. For example, we received approval for new parasiticides, such as ProHeart 12 in the U. S. and Simparica Trio in the EU and Canada.","We are enhancing our vaccine portfolio with new products like Versican Plus Bb Oral, the first oral vaccine for dogs in Europe, and Poulvac Procerta HVT-ND, our first venture vaccines for poultry. We also continued to invest in building our overall diagnostics capabilities with acquisitions in the reference lab space, which will be give us a more holistic offering to veterinarians. And we expanded our equine and pet care portfolio into nutritional formulas with the acquisition of Platinum Performance, a premier leader in this market.","Finally, in terms of our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders, we generated a 2019 quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, an increase of 30% from the 2018 dividend rate. And we completed approximately $625 million in share repurchases. We have built a strong record of delivering on this value proposition for shareholders over the last seven years. And I'm very confident we can continue on this path of long term growth and value creation, based on the capabilities, colleagues and customer focus we bring to every market opportunity.","Looking ahead now to the rest of 2020, animal health remains a steady and reliable market based on people's increasing commitment to their pets\u2019 health and based on the steady demand for safe and affordable animal proteins. For 2020, we currently expect the overall industry to return to growth of approximately 4% to 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The market showed a dramatic shift in 2019 from African swine fever in China with at least 50% reduction in herd size according to reports.","While this disease had a significant impact on our business in China last year, we see early signs of stabilization and the opportunity for the industry in terms of firms consolidating investments being made in better infrastructure and biosecurity and the frozen pork supplies being reduced. As the global pork market and trade picture sorts that more in 2020 and with increased export opportunities for many markets, we could see the overall animal health market return to slightly better growth rates.","In terms of species, the swine market should be below the overall market growth for 2020. The companion animal and poultry markets are expected to be somewhat above the market growth and cattle is expected to be a little more limited than the market, based on the continuing challenges faced by beef and dairy customers. For Zoetis, we expect to grow faster than the markets for companion animal and poultry and in line with the cattle market. For the soy market, we would expect to be in line or faster than the market depending on the pace of recovery from African swine fever and its impact on additional markets this year.","In terms of our guidance for 2020, Zoetis expects to grow revenue significantly faster than the industry in a range of 7% to 9.5% operationally. And in terms of adjusted net income, we expect operational growth in the range of 8% to 11%. To meet our goals for 2020, we will continue supporting our latest product launches in lifecycle innovations with direct-to-consumer advertising and the recently expanded pet care field force in the U.S. And in international markets, we're focused on supporting new products with field force expansions in certain markets and differentiating ourselves with a focus on direct field forces\u2019 effectiveness and technical expertise.","We will also continue investing in other accelerated growth areas, such as diagnostics, genetics, precision livestock farming and digital and data analytics. This will be an important year in diagnostics as we complete the integration of our systems and look to accelerate sales growth with more integrated offerings of medicines and diagnostics and importantly, we can deliver more value to our customers. And we'll continue advancing our pipeline with investments in parasiticides, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and other therapeutic areas.","The launch of Simparica Trio, our triple combination parasiticide is highly anticipated for 2020, and we remain confident in the U.S. approval in the fourth quarter with a loss shortly thereafter. As we have said recently, we completed the technical sections of the Simparica Trio package for the U.S., and are currently in the administrative review awaiting a final approval.","We've already received approvals for Simparica Trio in the EU and Canada, and we expect the Simparica Trio launch in Europe to begin in certain markets this month as we take a phased approach to the launch there. Based on these assumptions, we continue to expect to generate incremental global sales of Simparica Trio in 2020 at approximately $150 million.","I am energized by the opportunities ahead of us in 2020. We have a vibrant and growing companion animal portfolio, driven by internal innovation and more to come with Simparica Trio. We are delivering steady performance across our livestock products despite the market challenges some of our customers face from economic conditions, emerging infectious diseases and natural disasters.","We're partnering with our customers in innovative ways to help them stay ahead of the curve on evolving technology, new commercial opportunities and shift in consumer trends. We are building out our capabilities in digital and data analytics to bring meaningful solutions to the challenges facing their farms and clinics, and we are executing on a strategy for growth with internal and external investments that have us well positioned for long term growth.","I look forward to carrying on the company's successful formula of customer focus, innovation, and execution as we continue to deliver on our long-term value proposition to shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll hand things over to Glenn.","Glenn David","Thank you, Kristin, and good morning. As Kristin indicated, we had another exceptional year with revenue of $6.3 billion and adjusted net income of $1.8 million, with both top and bottom line exceeding the high end of our guidance ranges for the year. Reported revenue growth was 7% for the year, including 3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, which was driven primarily by strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Brazilian Real and Argentinian peso.","Operational revenue growth of 10% was driven by 2% price contribution and an 8% volume contribution. Volume growth included 2% from the addition of legacy Abaxis products, 2% from our key dermatology portfolio, 2% from new products and 2% from our other in-line portfolio. Revenue growth for the year was broad based with the U.S growing 11% and international growing 9% operationally. Companion animal led the way in terms of species growth, outpacing livestock for the year.","Revenue from our key dermatology portfolio, our diverse parasiticide portfolio with several new launches this year and legacy of Abaxis product, drove companion animal operational performance up 23%. Livestock declined 1% operationally for the year impacted by the outbreak of African swine fever in China and challenging beef and dairy cattle market conditions in the U.S. Our poultry and fish product portfolios continue to grow, partially offsetting the cattle and swine headwinds. Operational growth and adjusted net income of 14% was driven by strong revenue growth and gross margin favorability.","Now moving on to our Q4 financial results. We had solid performance again this quarter with revenue of $1.7 billion, representing an increase of 7% on a reported basis and 9% operationally. Adjusted net income of $440 million increased 15% on a reported basis and 13% operationally. Foreign exchange in the quarter drove an unfavorable 2% impact on revenue, primarily driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Brazilian Real and Argentinian peso.","Operational revenue growth of 9% for the quarter was driven by 1% price and 80% volume. The volume contribution of 80% includes 3% from new products, 3% from other inline products and 2% from key dermatology products. Contributions from legacy Abaxis products were not a material driver of growth in the quarter globally since this is our first full quarter lapping the impact of the prior year acquisition.","Breaking down our operational revenue growth by species, companion animal grew 19% and livestock grew 2%. Companion animal revenue growth was driven by continued strength of our key dermatology products and our parasiticide portfolio, including new products, Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 and the continued adoption of Simparica.","Equine also contributed to growth in the quarter with a full quarter revenue from the acquisition of Platinum Performance and its nutritional products, as well as continued growth of our CORE EQ Innovator vaccine. Livestock growth in the quarter was primarily driven by strong poultry and fish performance, partially offset by declines in cattle and the impact of African swine fever. Swine increased 1% operationally in the quarter despite the impact of African swine fever.","New products contributed 3% to overall growth in the quarter, driven by parasiticides Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as is known internationally, ProHeart 12 and the recently launched Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile. Other inline products contributed 3% to growth in the quarter. This was primarily driven by revenue from recent acquisitions and commercial agreements, including Platinum Performance, our reference lab acquisitions, the statement lab diagnostic test for equine and companion animal parasiticides, including Simparica. This growth was partially offset by declines in U.S. cattle and the ongoing impact of African swine fever.","Simparica contributed strong growth in the quarter with revenue of $42 million and 34% operational growth. For the full year, Simparica sales were $214 million dollars growing 40% operationally. Our key dermatology portfolio continued to grow globally this quarter, contributing 2% growth. Global sales were $200 million in the quarter, representing 29% operational growth. Full-year revenue for this portfolio was $754 million, growing 29% operationally.","The positive performance in this portfolio was driven by increasing market share, price and expand the usage of both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT into recently launched market. Sales in legacy Abaxis products was $68 million in the quarter, representing 5% operational growth over the prior year.","Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 6% with companion animal growing 15% and livestock defining 3%. Companion annual growth in the quarter was driven by increased sales of our two dermatology products, the impact of recent acquisitions, our parasiticides portfolio and a number of other inline products, including Cerenia and RIMADYL. U.S. dermatology sales were $133 million for the quarter growing 21%. Growth this quarter was driven by price and benefits from the direct to consumer advertising driving increased market share.","Our parasiticides portfolio, including new products, such as Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 and inline products, such as Simparica, contributed to strong companion animal growth. Positive companion animalperformance was partially offset by U.S. livestock declines in the quarters driven by cattle. Cattle product sales continued to be negatively impacted by unfavorable market conditions, driven by heavier and healthier animals coming in from pasture with a lower risk profile and pricing pressure driven by competition.","Partially offsetting challenges in cattle was continued poultry growth, primarily from our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. We also benefited from new customer adoption and competitors having product efficacy and supply challenges. Swine also had a strong quarter returning to growth due to increase sales in medicated feed additives and vaccines.","To summarize U.S. performance, innovation and returns on our investments drove positive results despite challenging market conditions impacting growth in cattle. Our international segment also contributed strong growth this quarter with operational revenue growth of 12%. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 26% and livestock operational growth was 5%. Companion animal growth was driven key dermatology products, growth in our parasiticides portfolio, including Simparica and our Stronghold franchise and legacy Abaxis products.","International livestock also performed well, driven by growth in cattle, fish and poultry. This growth was partially offset by modest declines in swine due to the ongoing impact of African swine fever. Growth in cattle was due to favorable pricing, as well as increased feedlot placements in Australia, new customers in other developed and emerging markets and favorable conditions in key markets such as Mexico.","The fish portfolio benefited from the continued uptake of the Alpha Flux parasiticide in Chile, while poultry growth was driven by price and increased sales of vaccines. As expected, swine remain challenged this quarter by the ongoing impact of African swine fever. We do see some positive signs, however, partially offsetting these declines with new markets launching our combination swine vaccines and growth in key accounts in China.","Our outlook 2020 remains neutral to slightly positive for swine in China. In the near term, however, we remain confident that other regions and proteins will increase production to help mitigate the pork shortage and long-term industrialization of pork production in China will be a tailwind. Overall, our international segment continues to be a significant driver of growth supported by innovation and the diverse portfolio across products and geographies despite the impact of African swine fever.","Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 68.5% increased approximately 210 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by foreign exchange, manufacturing cost efficiencies, product mix and price, partially offset by increased inventory charges. Total adjusted operating expenses grew 13% operationally. The increase was primarily related to compensation related expenses, the impact of recent acquisitions, direct-to-consumer advertising and investments to support future growth of the business.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. The decrease from the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to non-recurring discrete tax benefits recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019, partially offset by the impact of the global intangible low tax income or GILTI tax, which is effective for Zoetis in 2019. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 13% operationally, driven by strong revenue growth, favorability in gross margin and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 14% operationally compares to the same quarter in the prior year.","Now moving onto guidance for 2020. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late January. In 2020, we were projecting revenue between $6.65 billion and $6.8 billion, representing 7% to 9.5% operational growth. Foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind again next year of approximately 100 basis points. Innovation will be a key driver of growth next year, particularly in companion animal. Companion animal overall is expected to again outpace livestock, benefiting from our diverse parasiticide portfolio, key dermatology, diagnostics and strong market dynamics, including continued growth in emerging markets.","And as Kristin mentioned, our guidance assumes an incremental $150 million in revenue related to Simparica Trio. This estimate represents revenue for roughly three quarters of the year. And in 2020, as Kristin indicated, we anticipate all livestock species returning to global growth. From a geographic perspective, we anticipate balanced growth between our U.S. and international segments.","Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue is expected to be in the range of 30% to 31%, neutral to slightly increasing from 2019 due to unfavorable foreign exchange and mildly dilutive acquisitions, partially offset by price and positive mix. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the year are expected to be between $1.59 billion and $1.64 billion with an increase over 2019, focused on critical areas of revenue growth, including recent and future product launches, recent acquisitions and expansion into reference lab diagnostic, as well as the annualization of our U.S. field force expansion and direct-to-consumer advertising.","Adjusted R&D expenses for 2020 are expected to be between $455 million and $475 million consistent with our commitment to invest in pipeline opportunities, both lifecycle and novel new therapies. Going into 2020, investment will be focused on delivering the next wave of high value innovation, including monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry. We're also investing in strategic areas of focus, such as diagnostics, biodevices and precision livestock farming and strategies to maximize the value of the continual of care through integrated offerings.","Adjusted interest and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $215 million with the increase over 2019, driven by reduced royalty income, as well as lower interest income. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. The increase in 2020 is related to the impact of favorable nonrecurring discrete items that occurred in 2019.","Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $1.865 billion to $1.915 billion, representing operational growth of 8% to 11%. We remain committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. However, as I highlighted growth in adjusted net income in 2020 will be negatively impacted by the higher effective tax rate, the limited gross margin expansion and strategic investments.","For context, the higher effective tax rate in 2020 will negatively impact our adjusted net income growth by approximately 300 basis points. Consistent with 2019, we are anticipating elevated capital expenditures in 2020 to support investments in manufacturing focused on [technical difficulty] capacity increases and facilities to support pipeline opportunities.","We're also investing in information technology to support our recent acquisitions, as well as digital capabilities and data analytics. We're also committed to our capital allocation priority of returning excess cash to shareholders that isn't deployed internally or for business development opportunities. To that end, we recently announced 22% increase in our dividend and we have approximately $1.7 billion remaining under our multi-year share repurchase program after repurchasing approximately $625 million in Zoetis shares in 2019.","Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 and reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.65. While our guidance represents full year expectations, we do anticipate Q1 to be slightly weaker in terms of revenue with limited growth in adjusted net income due to the timing of the Simparica Trio launch and the investment required to support the launch and recent acquisitions.","Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. 2019 was another exceptional year in which we delivered 10% operational revenue growth and 14% operational growth and adjusted net income. Our guidance for 2020 underscores our ability to grow revenue organically, well above the market and grow adjusted net income faster than revenue. And our focus remains on delivering long term shareholder value through disciplined internal and external investments and returning excess cash to shareholders.","Now I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","My question for you is, if you could provide more color on the headwinds and tailwinds and the macro outlook for animal health in 2020? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","As we talked about, the overall market for 2020 in animal health is projected to grow at 4% to 5%, probably faster than that will be companion animal as we've seen in previous years. As we think about where Zoetis is coming in, we believe we\u2019ll grow faster than that market, really driven by our innovation. Obviously, we've given guidance around the excitement around Simparica Trio, our paras and our derm portfolio.","We see poultry growing faster than the market as well and Zoetis is growing faster than the market as well. We have some launches there, as well as the portfolio we have in poultry to help raise no antibiotics ever. We see cattle returning to growth in 2020, albeit slower than the overall market and we see Zoetis probably growing in line with the market overall and swine, we see returning to growth as well in 2020 and Zoetis is growing in line or faster. So as we see some of the headwinds though remain innovation overall as well as sort of a return to growth for livestock in general.","Operator","And we'll take our next Jon Block wit Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","You mentioned launching the Trio in Europe later this month. I guess anything you're willing to share on price of Trio, positioning in the market? In other words, what you guys can do to try to get the incremental revenue from the top two oral flea and tick products versus call it just partially cannibalizing Simparica? And then Glenn, one for you, when I look at that 2020 guide, it seems like revenue certainly ahead. The adjusted interest expense was above expectations. I think you alluded to less royalty income, what about just from a cash flow perspective? In other words in the guide, is there any assumed buyback or paydown of debt in there? Thanks for your time guys.","Kristin Peck","I'll take the first and I'll let Glenn take the second question. We are expecting to be launching commercial launch in Europe in a few markets. This month, we will do phase one. So Italy, Spain, and UK, are launching this month in Europe. We are not first to market as many of in Europe. There are other products in the market. So to your point, it is a competitive position.","We will be pricing, as we've spoken about before, at a premium to Simparica overall and really, as we look back the competitive side, it actually varies dramatically in Europe by market, with the different competitive products on the market overall. We remain excited for approval in Q1 in the U.S., and plan to launch shortly thereafter as is customer and as we spoken about another product launches, probably six to eight weeks after that. And in the U. S. as we spoken about, we should be first to market. Again, we'll plan to launch at a price premium to Simparica but at a discount probably, overall, if you look at it from the two products there. We\u2019re focused very hard in the U.S. in gaining share.","So we haven't gotten specific on overall pricing but it should be at a significant premium to Simparica today. But we haven't fully launched in the U.S., our pricing is not public yet in the U. S. So I'll let Glenn take the second question.","Glenn David","From a revenue perspective, very excited about the expectations for revenue growth this year with growth of 7 to 9.5% and obviously, very excited about Simparica Trio as well. In terms of the bottom line growth of 8% to 11%, a little less of a differential from revenue that we typically expect, a lot of that being driven by the impact of the tax rate change year-over-year.","Accounting for that impact, we have about another 300 basis point impact of growth at the bottom line and also, foreign exchange was negatively impacting us in terms of adjusted net income absolute number and that was about 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. Specifically to your questions, there is no assumed payback or pay down of debt. And in terms of share repurchase, the number of shares that we assume in our EPS are the shares ending as of the end of December 2019.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","Just sticking on the Trio to round out those set of questions. You've been talking about it for a while, obviously, on the conference calls and early this year at VMX, we saw a pretty significant presence from you on the Trio. Have you seen any response from your competitors ahead of the launch in terms of either stuffing channel or giving any promotions with the Spectra product in Europe or even with standalone products in the U.S., taking any price actions or any combo or bundling actions in the U.S. to try to get ahead of the March launch as that stock up in the first quarter? And then just on the same line follow-up. What's your expectation for Trio impact on gross margins, Kristin just following up on your comments and how it's priced? And obviously, you have the API component of two different drugs in there. So net-net, what's going to be the impact on gross margins in 2020? And then even in the out years as volume ramps from the Trio products?","Kristin Peck","This is the single biggest category in animal health or companion animal parasiticides. So it is a highly competitive space to exactly your point, it\u2019s a $4 billion market in the U.S. alone, its $2.5 billion. So we are expecting a significant competitive response. This is a category that a lot of people will defend. We would expect normal CapEx, obviously, trying to stuff the channels or fill in and fill up the shelves as best they can.","We're certainly expecting some of them to look at pricing programs, but we think there's significant excitement around the opportunity for a triple in the U.S. We\u2019ve certainly heard it. We did not, as you saw at VMX, we didn\u2019t have approval on this product. So we were not promoting this product at VMX. But there's a definite understanding that a triple is coming from us. I think customers are anticipating that and are very excited to have something new and innovative to share with their customers.","So I think we're expecting whatever you normally see in a competitive response, but this is a major category. So our plans for launch, our revenue guidance we provided, was anticipating a significant competitive response in this area overall. So I'll turn it over to Glenn to take the gross margin implications on Trio.","Glenn David","Yes, in terms of the impact on gross margin. For 2020, we expect it to be mildly beneficial to our overall gross margin. Obviously, as time goes on and we become more efficient in the production or operating at full capacity, we do expect this to be a higher margin product for us, and it will benefit our gross margin over time as we move beyond 2020.","Operator","Our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Can you give us an update on the diagnostic strategy at this point? Do you expect continued inorganic activity in reference labs, both U.S. and globally, or is it more of an organic build at this point? And can you speak to some of the success you've seen already in the bundling across the portfolio between therapeutics and diagnostics? And then separate question on stocking. Were there any stocking dynamics worth noting in the quarter? And should we anticipate distributor stocking in the first or the second quarter for Simparica Trio? I guess I just want to make sure we're thinking about the quarterly progression appropriately there? Thanks.","Kristin Peck","Sure, I'll take trio first. In Europe, we obviously did begin shipping in Europe to customers there. ","So you will see some stocking in Q1 there. In Q2, it will depend on exact timing, but there could be some shipments obviously in Q1 until we have an approval. As we said before, we won't be able to get very specific. But we're discussing weeks here and it just happens to be the timing in Q1. So it's hard to give you an exact guidance. But if you look at the $150 million guidance we gave you, it\u2019s assuming we're selling for three quarters of the year, so there could be stocking obviously.","But back to the diagnostic strategy overall, we remain very excited at diagnostics. For starter, it's a market growing at around 10% per year, so it's quite attractive. It continues to also drive use of our therapeutics and preventative. So it's exciting. So we look -- as we look into 2020, we're looking for double digit growth overall and Zoetis\u2019 diagnostics portfolio, both in the U.S and abroad. We\u2019ve spoken a lot about our point of care strategy. We're really focused there and increasing placements, as well as driving consumable use.","As you look at the reference lab strategy, we have made a number of BD deals over the last three or four months in the U. S specifically. These are small deals as you've seen but we're looking to build a network. This will be in the U.S. a lot of organic builds from there, scaling the sites we have today, looking at some spoke sites as well. But I think you will see some BD as we look to grow into international. So this will continue to be a mix of organic and inorganic but again, very focused on ROI. We don\u2019t see these as significant deals right now. We're looking at continuing to grow this over time, but great excitement.","If you look at sort of some of our excitement ending 2019 and moving into 2020, we've been leveraging our FREEDOM FLEX program, which combines and offers opportunities across our core portfolio in diagnostics, and are very excited to add in reference lab into that opportunity as we look into 2020.","Glenn David","And Erin just to add to the comments on the quarterly seasonalization and progression for Trio. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we would expect significantly more sales in Q2 for Trio and really you know that growing throughout the year. So we look at the overall progression of revenue for the company. We would expect Q1 to be slightly lower in terms of overall growth and then because of the investments that we're making in Q1 to support the launch of Trio, as well as some other strategic investments, we\u2019d expect income to be relatively flat or to low single digits.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Kreger","Kristin, can you just give us an update on the monoclonal products that you're talking about in cats and dogs. Where does that stand from a regulatory standpoint? And do you think they could be notable contributors in '21? Or is that more of kind of the late year launch of that? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","In our Q2 2019 guidance, we indicated we have filed in both the EU and U.S., and we're expecting approval in 2021. It is obviously too early for us to be terribly specific as these regulatory views we wish we could predict with that level of precision. So it's probably a little early to be able to say whether or not we have failed in \u201821 or \u201922. But you know these would be the first match reviewed by the FDA.","So you know we want to make sure we give them that over time, and we have less understanding of exactly how fast that will be by file. We continue to be very excited, as we spoken about before, pain in cats is you know really there are no products today that adequately serve that market. So there's a lot of excitement as well as for the canine. So when we have more information there, we're happy to provide it but we remain excited.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris schott","Just two here, first on the reference lab and organic build in the U. S. from here. Just give us some sense of how long you envision that taking to fully build out your network and portfolio in terms of when this becomes, I guess a bigger piece of the offering? My second question was just on the gross margin dynamics in 2020. It seems like we have kind of mix going in your favor with the growth in companion. I think the guidance is suggesting flat to slightly declining gross margins? So a bit more color of what's happening there. And longer term, is it fair to still think about gross margin improvements as we see that companion pipeline continuing to ramp over time? Thanks very much.","Kristin Peck","I'll take your first question and Glenn can take the second. If you look at reference lab build in the U. S., we think this is multiple years. We looked at scale in geographic as we've talked about, reference lab given the importance of logistics in reference lab, it is an MSA by MSA market and we're very focused on doing this and making sure we scale the sites that we opened. So we do believe this will take a number of years before we'll have a significant presence in the U. S. I would say the same for international. It'll be a buy and build.","So to your point, I don't think this is something you're going to see really be a significant player within the next 12 months. But we're very excited about the long term growth in scaling in the markets we've entered and then adding folks there. But I'll turn it over to Glenn to take the gross margin in 2020 and beyond question.","Chris schott","So in terms of the gross margins so stepping back to 2019, we benefited significantly from foreign exchange in 2019 to the tune of about 120 basis points. As we move into 2020 impact of that turns the other direction. We have approximately about a negative 50 basis point impact from foreign exchange on gross margin in 2020; so that all said, some of the favorability that we're seeing, A, from price but also from mix from a companion animal perspective. The other thing that you need to take into account is some of the acquisitions that we have completed, reference labs in particular and diagnostics, they do come in into slower or lower gross margin; so that all said, some of the mix favorability that we see companion animal.","One more time, we do anticipate that we'll continue to see gross margin improvements, driven by the completion of our supply network strategy, as well as some continued improvements in price and to the extent that companion animal continues to grow faster than livestock that will benefit our margins.","Operator","Your next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy Miner","Just one question. Could you comment on your China business, little more specifically give us color for the fourth quarter and also how do you see the corona virus impacting both business and your outlook for African swine fever? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","Sure, I'll start on corona and then I'll let Glenn get more into specifics of performance and 2019 expectations. As everyone is watching, the corona virus is obviously emerging very quickly in the sense of certainly the news overnight. As we look at our business right now, it's probably too early to tell exactly what the impact will be, but let me talk a little bit about some of the risks that we're watching.","First is just an overall economic slowdown, which is already driving some reduced overall consumption in animal proteins. As we\u2019ve seen some of the hardest hit markets are hospitality and travel. So without that, there's a number of people obviously not eating protein. So it should affect consumption a little bit. How long this lap will really impact whether or not that's a significant driver or not.","There's obviously some commercial risks, many of our fields are not able to get after veterinarians and many pet owners are not currently bringing their pets to veterinarians, giving some of the quarantine. But if quarantines lift or as that emerges, we'll watch that. We're obviously watching our supply chain. We do have a number of MFA -- APIs or active pharmaceutical ingredients that are produced in China for the world.","We're very confident with most of them that we have adequate supply multiple months. So even if the ports did shut down, we should be fine unless that was extended. The ports are still open and they are still shipping. So we don't see right now at the moment any impacts or overall supply chain.","We'll continue to monitor this. Obviously, last year the big impact was AFS, which we did see either flattening or returning to growth in China but obviously, that will be subject to the ability to continue to move both feed around China, as well as animal protein. So it's a little earlier to tell but hopefully that gives you a sense of some of the issues that we're tracking to get a sense. But it remains a significant market. I'll let Glenn sort of talk about performance and expectations for China overall.","Glenn David","Yes, so when you look at China overall, I\u2019ll start with full year and then talk a little bit about Q4. China for full year 2019 was about $200 million in revenue, which was essentially flat for the prior year, which is pretty impressive performance considering the impact of African swine fever, which we estimate to be greater than $50 million in 2019, and was really driven by rapid growth in companion animal. Companion animal now represents more than 50% of the overall revenue in China and is growing very rapidly. So the market performed very well even in the challenges of African swine fever. And I think you saw some of that, particularly in Q4 where we saw 10% growth in China in Q4 in operational perspective even with a negative $11 million impact from African swine fever.","Operator","The next question is from David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities.","David Westenberg","So you're a competitor, one of the largest competitors in diagnostics has historically 3 three or 4 times the amount on R&D versus Abaxis. In order to close the competitive gap, do you think it simply requires scaling or do you think that you need to actually close the R&D gap longer term? And then to sticking with diagnostics with the acquisitions in reference lab, what kind of safeguards in place do you have to make sure that your sales force remains focused on selling your products with such a wide product bag? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","So with your first question, I'm not sure, I know that there's a number of reports out on R&D, versus IDEXX, versus Zoetis. We have significant investments in R&D in our diagnostics portfolio. So I don't think we're looking at any incremental spending to close any perceived innovation or R&D gap there. You remember part of diagnostics has always been a core part of how we even develop the products we develop today, making sure that we can diagnose the diseases that we create treatments for.","So we remain very confident in our R&D spend and the percentage dedicated to diagnostics and see significant synergy from an R&D perspective between our core portfolio of medicines, vaccines, et cetera with diagnostics. So no, we don't see that.","As we look at the field force, we actually, again, we like to be solution selling as we've spoken about. So we go in and talk about a wellness visit of which diagnostic is a role. If we need to -- if we're looking to place new instruments or sign up somebody on a new reference lab offering, we bring in specialists, diagnostic specialists to do that.","And then we have diagnostics, technical specialists who come in and maintain that equipment. So we do not believe it's distracting at all. We do believe once you played that equipment that our core representatives and strategic account managers can really help drive consumable use as they talk about a wellness visit and how they can combine and looking at vaccines, preventative and doing wellness screening in diagnostics.","So we think it's actually quite synergistic. And we have experts that come into sort of help, focus sales and replacement of new equipment as well as in reference labs. So no, we don't see that as a big challenge.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Thank you very much, and congrats, Kristin, to a very nice start to your new role as CEO. I wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of the finalization of the Simparica Trio approval. So what needs to be done at this point? I know that you're highly confident that it's imminent, but what steps need to take place? And then, I believe that you mentioned that you'll wait six to eight weeks after the approval to launch. And could you just explain that? I would have expected the launch to come much more quickly after the approval, given that it's highly anticipated. Thank you.","Kristin Peck","Sure. I'll let Glenn take some of the specific details there.","Glenn David","So in terms of Simparica Trio approval, as we said, we're in an administrative review period. All the technical sections are complete. So we're just awaiting final response from the regulators at this point in time. In terms of time frame of six to eight weeks from approval to launch, that's pretty typical within the industry. There are a number of things that need to occur. You need to find a label, you need to complete packaging of the product, you need to make sure you're building up the appropriate launch quantities. Obviously, we're doing that every day and we're looking to minimize that time of six to eight week period, but that is very typical within the industry in terms of approval the launch based on the activities that need to occur post-approval.","Operator","The next question is from Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert","Kristin, back to ASF. Kristin, has your thinking changed at all in terms of the overall impact of ASF and when that impact will begin to abate? And then, Glenn, can you talk about how much growth you're factoring for the derm portfolio in 2020 and maybe comment bigger picture on what inning you think we're in, in terms of realizing global peak sales for that portfolio? Thanks.","Kristin Peck","I'll start with ASF. We do think it's the overall impact based on what we know today is leveling out in China. The real question is how fast will they rebuild the herds in China and how will China overall meet its animal consumption demand. So, as we sort of see it as we talked a little bit, we do think in China, specifically, you'll see flat- to low-single digit growth in our pork business there.","I think you'll slowly see some of the more innovative technologically advanced industrialized production start with very strong biosecurity. You're starting to see some signs of this, but it's in fits and starts and it's a little hard right now with corona to understand how fast that will really evolve.","But I think if you look at the broader impact of African Swine Fever, they are going to need to feed their people even if consumption is a little bit down. So I think you're going to see the impact of African Swine Fever in countries like the Brazil, the U.S. and EU as they look to meet that demand. There has been little volatility, obviously, given corona in pork prices more recently, but overall, they've been trending up. This will encourage producers to raise more pigs, raise heavier pigs.","We are seeing significant increases in export at least in the U.S. already and Brazil into China. So I think you'll see that, which is one of the, we believe, the drivers of why we said we think livestock overall across species will return to growth in 2020, because China will either have to feed their population, some will come from internal, but they will need significant imports into China and that will continue to come from Brazil, the U.S. and the EU, both in pork, but we're also seeing potential opportunities in both poultry and beef.","I'll let Glenn take the second question.","Glenn David","So in terms of derm growth, so, A, just looking back at 2019, a really strong year for the derm portfolio in 2019. We grew 29% operationally, U.S. growing 25% and international growing 38%. We'd expect to have continued growth in 2020, not to that level as we're working off of a higher base, but the areas that we expect to exceed growth, A, international. We expect international continue to outpace the U.S. in terms of growth, just because currently, the mix of the revenue between U.S. and international is about two-third U.S., one-third international, although the number of medicalized dogs is pretty much equivalent between the two. So we would expect to gain market share in international as vets get more and more comfortable with the products internationally. And the U.S. has had the advantage of direct-to-consumer advertising, which is not available on all international markets.","From the U.S. perspective, we continue to see opportunity in terms of continuing to expand the market, continuing to expand the usage into acute patients. And we still expect continue to get price in the U.S. as well. So we see 2020 has been another year of growth for the derm portfolio. But as the portfolio continues to mature, the pace of growth will slow.","Operator","The next question is from Navin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.","Prakhar Agarwal","Hi, this is Prakhar Agarwal on behalf of Navin. So, thanks for taking our questions. My first question is on the long-term opportunity for Simparica Trio. In the parasiticide space, the switch from topicals to orals was quite significant at greater than 70%. So, do you think the switch is a good analog for how much share could be switched over from the doublet to the triplet class or are we missing any dynamic? And secondly, on your Alpha Flux vaccine, do you have plans to launch this vaccine in Norway as well? And could you frame the market opportunity for this vaccine. Thank you.","Kristin Peck","Sure, I'll start with the first one, and I'll let Glenn take the second one. So, as you look at the long-term opportunity for Trio, it's obviously significant, as we talked about, it is the single largest category in companion animal and certainly overall. It's a highly competitive category as well. So, we're very excited. We think that we will gain share as we think about the $150 million incremental for 2020. The assumption in that overall is we do not have competition in the U.S. in that year, it is already obviously competitive space in many markets outside the U.S. We think we'll get a movement obviously from -- some from OTC. We think we'll certainly see some cannibalization.","We've spoken about from Simparica, but we also think it will take some of the other orals in the market overall. So from capital to oral is necessarily the best overall proxy and part of the long-term opportunity for Trio will also depend on our label versus the label of potential other competitors to come to the market as well as the distance between our launch and their launch. I know the favorite question is what are we expecting at competitor.","As you know in our fleet, there is very little information available. One of those is a private company, the other one does not disclose. So, at the moment, we believe we'll be the only product on in the U.S. in 2020 and that is part of the assumption on the $150 million, but the longer we are, the greater the opportunity to gain share overall. We continue to see this as a significant innovation for both the pet owner and the vet and a lot of excitement around it. So, we'll be investing significantly in that.","I'll turn it over to Glenn a little bit on Alpha Flux.","Glenn David","So in terms of the fish portfolio for Q4, we saw very strong growth at 17% and Alpha Flux was a key contributor to that growth in the quarter, particularly in Chile. There is already a similar product on the market in Norway. So that would not be an incremental opportunity in terms of launching a new product in Norway. As we look into 2020, we continue to see the fish portfolio growing. There may be some limitation in terms of the number of salmon available to treat based on certain regulations, but we still see fish as a rapidly growing species for us in 2020.","Operator","The next question is from Elliot Wilbur with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Elliot Wilbur","First question for Kristin, just want to ask you about longer-term R&D investment. At the midpoint of the guide for 2020 on a percentage basis, guidance would have you coming in below 7% and that number has trended down. On a relative basis, last couple of years, obviously, you've enjoyed strong growth. But as you think about driving -- or the need to invest to really drive more innovation, is a sub-7% R&D ratio sustainable? Or should we expect that to increase, perhaps as we start to see the top line decelerate a little bit in the next couple of years? Just a quick follow-up for Glenn. You mentioned the lower gross margin profile of the diagnostic businesses, but as we think about modeling segment margins, I would also presume that on an operating income basis, those businesses also have lower margins, but I want to confirm that. Thanks.","Kristin Peck","On long-term R&D investment, we look every year as the portfolio of opportunities and innovation that we have ahead of us and invest based on where we see those opportunities. It does fluctuate a little bit year-to-year. It's been growing, I think, faster than our overall SG&A, not necessarily always at revenue growth. We are -- we've, I think, made very strong investments.","As we see opportunities, we're more than happy to increase that R&D investment and have done so certainly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, but we are confident that the spend around where we are again, you should expect fluctuations year-to-year based on opportunities. Some of these studies can, especially in livestock, when you move them, they can drive significant costs year-to-year, but we are very confident that we have the right level of spend to drive our value proposition, significant top line growth at or faster than the market long-term in what we've provided overall. I'll see if Glenn wants to add anything to that and he can take the second question.","Glenn David","So in terms of the question on operating margins for diagnostics, so gross margins will be lower over the long period of time for diagnostics. However, when you look at operating margin, obviously, right now we're in the build phase. So it's a little lower than our overall business. But as we're progressing over the next number of years, with the ability to leverage our commercial infrastructure, we do see the operating margins for diagnostics coming very close to our core portfolio as well.","Operator","The next question is from Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Balaji Prasad","So a couple of questions on the poultry side. One, Kristin, you spoke about your competitors add efficacy and supply challenges in the quarter. What -- can you throw some more light on what were these challenges and how prolong do you think this could be? And for 2020, would you still have been able to grow faster than market if these dislocations did not exist? Secondly, could you also throw some light on the market opportunity for vector vaccines and how should we think about the portfolio on revenue ramp from the segment?","Kristin Peck","Sure. I'll let Glenn take these.","Glenn David","So in terms of the poultry outlook, A, this year, we had very strong performance in poultry. We grew 10% for the year globally in poultry. And we see 2020 as being another very positive year for poultry growing much faster than the overall market and with our portfolio continuing to outpace the market.","In terms of the vector vaccine, in 2019, we launched our first vector vaccine that really set the stage for us from an R&D perspective to continue to develop more and more vaccines over the next number of years for those to become a bigger section of our portfolio and we do see poultry continuing to be a rapidly growing market and we'll continue to invest in our R&D for that market.","Operator","The next question is from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Just two quick ones on diagnostics. You talked about double-digit revenue growth in 2020, could you just maybe help us think about how much of the contribution you expect from the three reference lab deals that you've done and what you're kind of expecting for organic growth kind of ex those deals? And then, Glenn, I think you mentioned reference lab being a drag on margins -- gross margins in 2020. Could you maybe just give us some sense of magnitude and help us kind of get a better picture of what you're expecting for margins for the underlying business? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","Sure. I'll take the first. Obviously, if you look at diagnostics overall, to be clear, we are expecting double-digit growth in our core point of care Zoetis diagnostics. That's not being driven by reference labs. Reference labs would be incremental to that. It's, again, I want to emphasize, still a pretty small part of our overall portfolio in the U.S., but we are expecting double-digit growth in both the U.S. and in international in the point of care space. But I'll let Glenn talk a little bit more about gross margin overall.","Glenn David","From a gross margin perspective, again, overall on diagnostics, as we are expecting rapid growth in that area, it will be a negative driver of our overall gross margin as those products tend to be of a lower gross margin profile. When you look at the overall EPS impact, particularly to your question on reference labs, reference labs in 2020 is about a negative $0.03 to $0.04 impact on our overall EPS based on the investments we're making to grow that business for the future.","Operator","The next question is from Kevin Ellich with Ace Research. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","So a lot of my questions have been asked, but just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more in detail on what you're doing in the digital and data analytics and when we could see some material impact from those initiatives. Thanks.","Kristin Peck","Digital and data analytics, obviously, is an important strategy of the Company. It's one of our five priorities as we move into 2020. I would say there's two components of that. One is, leveraging digital and data to drive greater sales of our core business. So, that's really focused around better targeting our customers, providing more personalized and customized solutions for them. So leveraging the data we have to better understand how they operate their business, what products will be most attractive, what offers will be most attractive to them. So, I think that will -- that's already in place and I think we're doing a very strong job both in the U.S. and international of leveraging some of those capabilities to drive our core business.","We also see that opportunity in both pet care and livestock to create new revenue-generating solutions. Some of that in the pet care side will be around overall diagnostics opportunities and linking those opportunities to our core portfolio and providing incremental insights to our customers. In livestock, that remains as well around both our genetics portfolio as well as our precision livestock farming, which we see as a significant growth driver for us in the medium- to long-term. I think if you look at both the consumer preferences and where the industry is moving, it's moving more to individualized animal care.","So, solutions such as what we have a Smartbow, which is ear tags for dairy cattle and better understanding the health and the productivity aspect of animals, individual animals and helping producers and veterinarians make better decisions in the short term is an opportunity, and as we link that to both our genetics business, which is you can also predict which animals will be born healthier and will have a better productivity. And then we see in the medium term the opportunity to link that as well to our diagnostics and really provide both veterinarians, producers, and consumers with better understanding and better health for animals. So, we think this will help drive our business.","As we see some of those that you saw are more short-term opportunities, some are more medium term. And when I think about the connection between all three genetics, precision livestock, data in our core portfolio in diagnostics, that's probably more in the medium to long term.","Operator","Next question is a follow-up from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","Just had a quick one that keeps coming up. So I appreciate you squeezing me in. I've had a lot of questions on products coming off IP or potential generic competition or others. You talked a little bit about no expectation for a competitor, Simparica Trio, for example, but I was wondering if you have anything -- any expectations, any thoughts about a competing product in the derm portfolio in the U.S.? And also products like Draxxin, haven't had questions on IP rolling off there for a while. So, I'm just curious if you're seeing anything there or sort of what your expectations for that for 2020?","Kristin Peck","As we look, I'll just start with derm. We obviously have very significant market for dermatology. We have been expecting competition will enter at some point. Based again in our industry, there's not great data, so I can't tell you exactly when competitor will launch. We are obviously planning for our competitor to launch in the next one to three years. Exactly when that will be, will be difficult for us to fully assess, but we do expect a potential small or large molecule entrant. We don't know exactly when that will be, but we have put plans in place to prepare for that overall as a key focus for us.","And for Draxxin, we still have patent protection through 2021. This is a significant market. So, we again here expect we will see competition when does hit and when patent exclusivity runs out. That's a significant market. But as we said, what's different about animal health and human health is, even though we'll see obvious competition, we still think in our business that normally has an impact between 20% and 40% both in sort of market share and price over a number of years. So we do expect obviously a challenge in 2021 or 2022 on Draxxin.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions, I'll return the floor to you, Kristin, for closing remarks.","Kristin Peck","Well, thanks very much for -- I appreciate all the great questions today and if you got any further questions please do ask them. Thanks so much.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s program. Thank you for your participation.

I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including, but not limited to, our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 5, 2015. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","We have a significant amount of detail to cover today, including specific details of our financial outlook through 2017. We will be posting both Juan Ram\u00f3n and Paul's prepared remarks on the Investor section of zoetis.com following the call to help clearly disseminate these details.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will briefly comment on our performance for the quarter. And then I will provide details of the operational efficiency program that we announced this morning. Paul will then walk you through our result for the quarter and discuss the financial impact of the operational efficiency program, including an update to guidance for 2015, '16 and '17.","During the first quarter, we generated operational growth of 6% in revenue and 14% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.41 per share. During the quarter, half of our operational growth or 3% was attributed to price. New products, such as ACTOGAIN an acquired product from Abbott Animal Health, accounted for 2% while in-line products contributed to 1% of revenue growth for the quarter.","As a note, all the following growth rates that I will discuss are operational. In livestock, we grew 7% to $715 million with all species contributing to growth. Cattle revenue grew 7% to $397 million with favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil driving growth across the portfolio, while weather and reduced herd size led to declines in Australia and New Zealand. Swine revenue, which grew 13% to $170 million, is benefiting from increased herd size in the U.S. after a winter of lower piglet mortality from PEDv plus positive industry momentum in the CLAR region. Poultry revenue grew 1% to $129 million as the U.S. reintroduction of Zoamix, a medicated feed additive, helped to offset a negative impact from the timing of product rotations in several countries.","Turning to animal health -- companion animal health. Revenues grew 4% to $377 million due to the continued performance of key brands and overall strong growth in China and Latin American markets. We closed on the purchase of Abbott Animal Health assets in early February, so sales of newly acquired Abbott products also contributed to results. They were recorded primarily in the U.S. where we have seen additional competition in the pain and sedation markets.","These results continue to demonstrate the strength of the business model as defined by our 3 interconnected capabilities: the largest and most capable field force in the industry with direct customer interactions, investing more innovation than any other company, and having the highest quality products and more reliable supply at a competitive cost. These 3 capabilities form an essential foundation for long-term success in animal health. Going forward, we are committed to investing in these capabilities but also see an opportunity to use them in more focused ways to enhance competitiveness and drive greater value for our customers and shareholders.","Over the last 2 years, since becoming an independent company, we have delivered on our operating and financial targets, created shareholder value and continue to meet our customer needs while standing up a new global company and infrastructure. We are certainly proud of what we have achieved. And as we transition out of our stand-up phase, we are focused on driving efficiency and reducing complexity that is a barrier to productivity. The program we announced today is a comprehensive plan that is designed to simplify operations, improve our cost structure and better allocate resources. We enter this next stage building on solid business performance, and we'll emerge as a stronger, simpler and more cost-efficient organization.","We expect to generate cost savings of $300 million in 2017 and see our adjusted EBIT margin improve from 25% in 2014 to approximately 34% in 2017 as we reduce complexity and achieve a greater focus on key brands and markets. We are fully aligned to achieve these goals and have the plans in place to incentivize our leaders to exceed these targets.","These initiatives will allow us to derive additional value by taking full advantage of our scale. It will allow us to invest in the products, markets and infrastructure that will drive profitable growth and continued leadership in the animal health industry.","There are several important reasons why we are initiating this program. First, after 2 years of separating from Pfizer, we now have full control of our operations, manufacturing and corporate systems and we have identified significant opportunities for improvement. Second, while the breadth of our portfolio and global footprint remain strength of our business, we have seen certain elements of our breadth generate complexity that is a barrier to delivering value to our customers and to generating long-term growth. Third, we are beginning to see the benefits of implementing our ERP system. The resulting standardization and potential to simplify our business through our new ERP system will allow us to increase productivity and streamline operations. And finally, we remain focused on growing revenues and finding the most productive ways to allocate resources to internal investments and business development activities.","We have 3 main objectives for this operational efficiency initiative. First, we want to reduce complexity that does not add value for our customers and our business. Second, we want to optimize our resource allocation and efficiency. And third, we want to better position Zoetis for long-term profitable growth.","We'll deliver our first objective to reduce complexity by enhancing our focus on products, markets and manufacturing plants that are most important to our future. We'll eliminate approximately 5,000 lower-revenue and lower-margin product SKUs out of a total of 13,000. This will drive higher focus and more reliable supply of our products and services.","We'll enhance our manufacturing operations and accelerate the implementation of our supply network strategy. We plan to sell or exit about 10 manufacturing sites over the long term.","Reflecting the strategic importance of manufacturing to our business model, Roman Trawicki, President of Global Manufacturing and Supply, will now report directly to me as part of the executive team. We will change our selling approach in approximately 30 markets by shifting to an indirect sales model or reducing our presence in certain countries.","We reduce the number of regional reporting segments from 4 to 2: the U.S. and International. We expect these changes to result in greater decision-making authority closer to the customers while leveraging our scale to efficiently deliver marketing and other operational support. The U.S. Region will be led by Kristin Peck and the International Region will be led by Clint Lewis. Both are current members of our executive team and will continue reporting to me.","To deliver on our second objective, to optimize resource allocation and efficiency, we will take the following actions: We will leverage the efficiency and standardization of our newly implemented ERP system to significantly reduce general and administrative costs in corporate functions. In addition to the ERP benefits, another important efficiency driver will be a reduction of management layers and increased span of control through the organization. We'll improve our ability to be more dynamic and agile in responding to customer needs by shifting marketing resources closer to the customer and simplifying all areas of noncustomer-facing commercial infrastructure. And we'll enhance our R&D focus to support a smaller portfolio of products as well as better prioritize the R&D portfolio to invest in projects with the highest returns.","In the past, we have demonstrated our commitment to improve our operations and be more efficient. In 2009, we achieved a successful transformation when we became the world's largest animal health business through several acquisitions. Then in 2013, we became a large, global independent company followed by 2 consecutive years of industry-leading performance. Through each of these changes we have made ourselves better, improve how we serve customers and create new and greater value to our stakeholders. I'm confident that the comprehensive plan we have announced today will allow us to transform again, building on our successful business model to deliver high-quality profitable revenue growth and becoming a more competitive company.","These are significant initiatives that will drive us to be a more focused and streamlined company. As a result, we'll see a reduction in the number of positions at Zoetis of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 over the next 12 to 18 months, subject to any consultation with work councils and unions in certain markets.","With the implementation of this initiative, we will better align Zoetis' resources and operating structure with our 3 interconnected capabilities; supply products, more reliable and at a competitive cost; increase capacity to invest in future business drivers; and finally, tailor the product portfolio and improve efficiency of the operating model so we can pursue the next horizon of opportunity as a world leader with a single focus on animal health. Through this process, we'll be more competitive and better positioned to achieve long-term profitable growth.","Before Paul cover the financial details, I would like to thank all our colleagues who have contributed to our success through an environment of intense change. Our next transformation will be key to supporting our future success, and I know that we have the capabilities and the team to implement these significant changes.","Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. We have lots of important things to talk about on this call, as we just revealed our plans to improve the efficiency of our operating model. But before we get to that, I don't want us to lose sight of the terrific quarter that we just put on the board. So let's get started.","As you'll remember, our fourth quarter of 2014 featured strong operational growth and we were able to carry that momentum forward into Q1 of 2015 and give us a good start to the year. We delivered on our primary value drivers posting revenue and adjusted net income growth on an operational basis of 6% and 14%, respectively. Pretty good, right?","Like other U.S. multinational companies, FX rates had a major impact on our reported results. On a reported basis, FX rates decreased our reported revenue by $58 million, resulting in our reported revenue growth being flat with Q1 of 2014. The impact on our adjusted net income was $16 million and so reduced our growth in adjusted net income from 14% on an operational basis to 8% on a reported basis. So FX impacted our top line by some 600 basis points and adjusted net income by 600 basis points.","I said this before and I'll say it again today, we can't control FX rates. We manage our business on an operational basis, and on that basis, we're continuing to deliver strong fundamental growth in revenue and profits.","You can read about the regional segment results in the press release and tables, so I won't spend too much time on them here, but I do want to cover a few highlights. The U.S. continued to perform very well, up 9% versus Q1 of '14, with strong livestock performance, which was up 14%. We continue to gain share in the U.S. livestock segment, especially cattle, based on producers' confidence in the reliability of our products to protect their investment in their animals. In companion animal, which was up 3%, we anticipate even more positive results through the balance of the year as we now have increased supply for APOQUEL. CLAR also continues performing well, with revenue up 13% on an operating basis, and that's driven by Brazil and other emerging markets. Later, when I talk about our go-forward plans to streamline and adjust our global footprint, I'll speak to our plans to deemphasize our efforts in Venezuela where the business and economic climates are becoming more challenging.","In APAC, where we posted 1% operating growth in revenue, we're seeing good performance in emerging markets like China but drought conditions in developed markets, including Australia and New Zealand are having an impact. In EuAfME, where revenue was flat compared with Q1 of 2014, the takeaway is that good performance on our key brands in companion animal are being offset by declines in anti-infectives, primarily due to legislative changes in France.","Now let me turn to what I will call our operational efficiency initiative. This initiative is a natural next step in the evolution of our company as a stand-alone entity with a singular focus on animal health. While we enjoy an enviable position in animal health today, our current product portfolio, footprint and organization came about in ways that were, to some extent, unplanned. The makeup of our product portfolio was heavily influenced by human health acquisitions made by Pfizer that had animal health components. These were very important to building our scale and portfolio, but the animal health assets were not the focus of those deals. And while we spend a lot of time and energy standing up our own organization and building our own culture, we quite naturally carried across organizational designs, processes and practices that worked well when we were a division of Pfizer, but may not represent the best options for a pure-play animal health company. Said another way, it's doubtful that we serendipitously came upon the best possible structure and organization to maximize our opportunity in the animal health industry.","Our first priority over the last few years has been to build out the functions that we need to support our business on a stand-alone basis. We had to establish our own supply chain, build our own IT infrastructure and put in place the G&A functions like finance, HR and legal to support a global public company. While we did that, we elected to leave our commercial and R&D organizations largely as is to minimize the impact of our stand-up on our customers and on our business.","I think our track record of revenue and profit growth over the last 2 years, and so far into 2015, support the wisdom of that approach. But now with the completion of the stand-up activities in sight, it's time to look at the entirety of our current state and take steps to improve the design and efficiency of our company.","Importantly, we are not questioning the fundamental elements of our business model. Our model relies on what we refer to as our 3 interconnected capabilities: one, face-to-face interaction with our customers to drive revenue; two, investment in product innovation to sustain our revenue base and our growth prospects; and three, the ability to meet our customers' demand with quality products. These capabilities form the basis of our competitive advantage in the global animal health industry and changes to these areas will fall into the category of continuous improvement, not major changes.","The bulk of our future cost savings will not impact these areas. Our field force, the personnel in the front lines with our customers, will remain largely intact. The scope of our activities in R&D will also remain substantially the same, and we will continue to invest in programs to build and improve our supply chain.","Let me separate the 2015 program into 2 parts as I see them and then add on the previously announced supply network strategy to think about 3 areas of focus. Part 1 is what I'll call rationalizing our footprint, part 2 is driving improved efficiency in our operating expenses, and part 3 is streamlining and improving the efficiency of our supply chain.","Starting with rationalizing our footprint. This work included a review of the number of SKUs that make up our product portfolio, consideration of moving to indirect sales models in a number of markets where we currently have a direct presence and evaluations of markets where we might choose to reduce our efforts. The headline here is that we will be eliminating nearly 40% of our total SKUs. These SKUs create significant complexity across multiple functions within our company. Of course, this will reduce our revenue and gross profits in the near term, but it will enable us to substantially improve the efficiency of our operations, from our supply chain and sales support, to G&A expenses and the product maintenance costs that are part of our R&D. With a leaner portfolio comprised of our more profitable product assets, we will have better growth prospects.","We also intend to move from direct sales models to indirect distributor models in certain countries and reduce our efforts or exit some markets. When complete, the streamlining of our portfolio and global footprint will reduce our expected 2017 sales by some $280 million and gross profit by about $100 million. For the avoidance of doubt, those numbers are based on current FX rates. The estimated revenue and gross profit impacts are reflected in our revised guidance for 2016 and 2017.","Part 2 of the initiative is driving improved efficiency within our SG&A expenses and our investment in R&D. We're collapsing from 4 regions to 2 as we go forward. We're reorganizing the support for countries, including enabling functions, like finance, IT, HR and legal, but also the noncustomer-facing resources that support our field sales forces. We're taking steps to improve the focus of our R&D activities, supporting a smaller portfolio of products, identifying greater efficiency in our regulatory practices and better prioritizing our R&D spend. And yes, our expected spend for customer-facing resources will be less as well, mainly driven by the reduction in the number of markets where we'll have a direct presence, and the deemphasis of certain other markets but also through improvements in efficiency.","In total, by calendar 2017, we expect our total operating expenses, that is the sum of SG&A plus R&D, to be roughly $300 million less than it would have been but for this initiative.","As I said just a moment ago, we are not changing our business model here and that should be reflected in the way you should think about the sources of the $300 million of future savings. Roughly 1\/3 is expected to come from reduced G&A and another 1\/3 from commercial resources that are not customer-facing. That's roughly 2\/3 of the expected savings coming from areas that should not impact our ability to deliver near-term and long-term revenue growth.","Of the remaining cost savings, about 10% is expected to come from improvements in efficiency within our R&D organization. About 5% is expected to come from the reduction of our field resources tied to our revised global footprint and reduced emphasis in some emerging markets, and the balance of the cost savings here is expected to come from reducing complexity and increasing efficiency in other areas.","The third and final piece of the initiative is the supply network strategy that Kristin Peck outlined at our Investor Day last November. Most of the benefits of that work will be realized after 2017. So for now let's set the supply network strategy aside and focus on the activities that will impact our results in the period from 2015 to 2017, but keep in mind that the supply network strategy initiative is expected to add some 200 basis points to our gross margin by 2020 on top of the improvements driven by the 2015 initiative.","You've heard me say this many times in the past that when we're looking at our operating efficiency, there are opportunities for us to do better. Today we back those words up, providing you with a framework of our plans to improve the operating performance of Zoetis while preserving the key elements of our value proposition. In our to be state in calendar 2017, we'll be an even better company than we are today, more profitable on a slightly smaller revenue base, positioned to deliver better growth from a more focused product portfolio and working off of a leaner cost structure that can be leveraged to support revenue and profit growth over the long term.","After completing the change we're announcing today, we'll still be the leader in animal health, and we will continue to be the biggest investor in innovation in animal health. And we will continue to have the largest direct sales network in the industry. Our improved efficiency will provide us with more flexibility to allocate resources where we can best serve our customers' needs and to further distance ourselves from the competition.","The efficiency initiative adds an estimated $200 million to our expectations for pretax earnings in 2017, driven by the $300 million in operating expense savings, offset in part by the $100 million of projected decrease in gross profit attributable to the streamlining of our product portfolio and the rationalizing of our global footprint. This initiative adds roughly $0.28 to our prior estimate of 2017 adjusted net income per share.","So the song remains the same, only better. We're a company that can grow its re-based revenues in line with or faster than the mid-single-digit growth of our markets while holding the growth in our leaned-out operating expenses to the inflation rate and thereby delivering long-term profit growth greater than our revenue growth. And that's off of a higher profit base, and that's a winner.","Of course, the improvements in our future financial model don't come free. So I want to take a few minutes to talk about one-time costs generally and to specifically address the costs associated with the efficiency initiative. First, it's important for you to know that we have a high standard when it comes to costs that we characterize as onetime and, therefore, are excluded from adjusted net income. Our policy limits such adjustments to purchase accounting, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items that we evaluate on an individual basis. These include direct and incremental costs required to complete the stand-up of the company and those direct costs that we will incur to execute our efficiency plan.","Next, we want to be transparent about the amount and nature of these costs, so our intention is to provide disclosure of our onetime costs in 3 buckets. The bucket for stand-up costs and other onetime costs that you're already familiar with; a new bucket for the efficiency initiative that we announced today; and a third bucket for the cost associated with the longer-term elements of the supply network strategy. We estimate our remaining pretax stand-up and other onetime costs at $180 million to $210 million with those costs to be recorded primarily in the remainder of 2015 and through 2017. These are primarily all-cash costs.","We estimate the onetime pretax cash costs associated with the efficiency initiative to be in the range of $340 million to $400 million and to be incurred in 2015, 2016 and with some modest portion moving into 2017. We expect actual cash payouts to occur over the next few years. Note that there will also be noncash charges triggered by this initiative. We are not providing an estimate of these charges as both the amounts and timing could vary widely. As we incur these noncash charges, we'll call them out for you when recognized.","Finally, the supply-network strategy. onetime-pretax cash costs are currently estimated at $60 million to $100 million and are expected to be incurred over the term of the plan. It's worth noting that we are still in the early phases of architecting the supply network strategy, and the final onetime costs for this activity could be substantially different depending on the final outcome of our ongoing analysis of our supply network and the timing or nature of any specific site exits. There will also be noncash charges triggered by the supply network strategy, and we will call those out to you when recognized.","Note that the estimates of onetime pretax costs for both the efficiency initiative and the supply network strategy ignore the possible proceeds that we may receive from the sale of certain assets, which could potentially offset some of the onetime cash costs. We provided a webcast slide that summarizes our current estimates of the onetime pretax cash costs associated with each of the 3 buckets over the period from 2015 to 2017. We will refresh our view of the various buckets of onetime costs as appropriate.","I want to call your attention now to an unrelated change to our go-forward outlook, and that's our decision to decrease our activities in Venezuela. The animal health industry in Venezuela features solid underlying fundamentals and our business there has performed well. However, recent economic developments necessitate an evaluation of our efforts there. While our business in Venezuela is profitable, it has become increasingly difficult to realize those profits in U.S. dollars. Unless and until that environment changes, sales and profits there will drive low quality earnings, so we're significantly paring back our activities there.","To be clear, Venezuela is a solid local market and we will maintain a presence there as we believe that the environment will improve over time. However, in the interim, we believe it's prudent to reduce our activities and exposure there.","The decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela impacts our revenue and profit expectations for 2015, '16 and '17. The impact on 2015 can be seen in the exhibit to our press release that bridges from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. We've also provided a slide on the webcast that shows the impact of Venezuela on 2017, which decreases our expectations for adjusted net income in 2017 by $0.07 per share.","Now let me provide an update on our guidance for the full year 2015 in light of the changes in FX rates since our last guidance update, the anticipated impacts of the efficiency program and our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. I also want to update you on our expectation for 2016 and '17 and to provide you with more detail about those years. We felt it was important to say more about 2016 and '17 as there are a lot of moving parts here, and we want you to have a clear picture of our expectations.","First, 2015 full year guidance. In our press release and in a webcast slide, we provided a bridge from our prior guidance to our revised guidance. The headline is that despite the continued headwinds from changes in FX rates and our decision to reduce our business in Venezuela, we're holding our guidance for adjusted net income per share for 2015 in the range of $1.61 to $1.68 per share. This includes pluses and minuses. FX is a minus again. The changes in FX rates from late January, underlying our last updated guidance, to late April, decreased our revenue expectation for 2015 by some $75 million or 155 basis points, while the impact on adjusted net income was much less, only about $5 million or 60 basis points. Then our decision to pare back our efforts in Venezuela reduces our revenue expectations by $50 million, operating expenses by $5 million and decreased our expectations for adjusted net income by $25 million.","Finally, the big plus, and that's the impact of the efficiency initiative, which reduced our expectations for operating expenses by $45 million compared with our prior guidance and increased our expected adjusted net income by $30 million. So when the dust settles, we expect our reported revenue to be down by $125 million from our prior guidance range and our adjusted net income to be consistent with our prior guidance, $1.61 to $1.68 per share.","It's worth pointing out that we decreased our 2015 guidance for revenue growth on an operational basis by 100 basis points to the range of 5.5% to 7.5%. The reduction in the growth rate is due to the expected reduction in sales in Venezuela. We translate Venezuela revenues at the fixed official exchange rate of VEF 6.3 to the dollar, so the $50 million expected reduction in revenue shifts the operational growth rate. And the adjusted net income operational growth rate is estimated to increase 1% as a contribution from our efficiency program should more than offset the impact of Venezuela.","Turning to 2016 and '17. We provided a lot of detail for you so that you can recalibrate your expectations for us through 2017. As you can see how this longer-term guidance compares with your prior expectations, I submit that you must first revise your prior expectations to reflect the changed FX rates. To help you do that, the change in FX rates from late January to late April should reduce your 2016 and 2017 revenue expectations by roughly 215 -- excuse me, 215, 2-1-5 basis points, cost of goods sold by 260, 2-6-0 basis points and operating expenses, including both SG&A and R&D by 170 basis points, with the result being a roughly 235 basis point decrease in projected adjusted net income driven by the changes in FX rates. Using that re-based forecast in comparison with our revised guidance for 2016 and '17 will enable you to isolate and evaluate the impacts of the 2015 efficiency initiative together with our decision to reduce our efforts in Venezuela. In a nutshell, and looking at 2017, when the full benefits of our efficiency initiative are expected to be realized, the efficiency initiative increases our expectations for 2017 pretax income by roughly $200 million. Meanwhile, the Venezuela action reduces our pretax expectations by $55 million. Net, we add $145 million to our pretax expectations for 2017, roughly $100 million in adjusted net income or $0.20 per share. As Juan Ram\u00f3n mentioned, the steps we are taking over the next several years are expected to enable us to improve our EBIT margin by some 500 basis points in 2017 to circa 34%.","Here are a few other factors for you to consider. Our guidance does not reflect any future currency devaluation in Venezuela. We expect a slightly higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year 2015, higher than the 27% that we had in the first quarter of 2015. The operating expense benefits that we are seeking will begin to be most evident in Q4, and our guidance assumes a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares outstanding. This includes share repurchases totaling an estimated $100 million in the first half of 2015, which are partially offset by actual and projected dilution relating to employees' equity-based compensation. We also assumed a comparable level of diluted weighted average shares outstanding for 2016 and '17 as we intend for our share repurchase program to at least offset projected dilution from future employee compensation programs, including the acceleration impacts of our operational efficiency initiative. All the other details of our guidance are included in the table attached to our press release.","Finally, we covered a lot of ground on this call. To assist with clear communications, as John said, we will be posting copies of Juan Ram\u00f3n's and my scripts to our Investor Relations website following this call. That concludes my prepared remarks and we'll now open up the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim.","Louise Alesandra Chen - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So my question is on your organic sales growth and also your gross margin once you lap on the headwinds from, I guess, getting rid of some of these lower-margin SKUs.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Louise. And definitely, our plan is to have our growth in terms of revenues in line or faster than the market. The market is expected to grow about 5% in the medium- and long-term, and we are also targeting it to grow in line with this growth or exceed this growth. In terms of gross margin, we also plan to significantly increase our gross margin. So eliminating these lower-margin SKUs will represent 200 basis points of gross margin improvement and also the price increases and also the discipline on -- or the reduction of expenses also will generate a significant improvement in gross margin. So on top of that, as Paul mentioned, our plan and work strategy that we announced at the time of the Investor Day will also generate another 200 basis points of gross margin improvement.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, Louise, and it's Paul, I'll just follow on that. I'll just point you to the slide on the webcast for the 2015 to '17 guidance, and you can see the impact -- or the expected improvement in our gross margin there, where we're looking out to 2017 after the, as I say, after the dust settles. So we'll get to a margin where we're projecting a range of 32% to 33% and with the opportunity to do better than that as we continue our progress on our supply network strategy.","Operator","And we can take that question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So looking at the operational improvement initiative. Paul, you laid out a lot of good information. I guess kind of a combination question. In 2016, operational growth looks a little bit like the negative 1% to plus 2%. Is that really due to getting out of Venezuela? Because it looks like you guys expect some pretty decent growth from that market. And I guess strategically, have you embedded much in terms of M&A acquisitions? I guess, where do your interests really lie within diagnostics? It looked like a new product launch in diagnostics may have helped drive some of the companion animal growth we saw in U.S. Just wondering if that's the feline rapid test and wondering if you have other plans in that category.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, thanks for the question, Kevin. It's Paul. I'll start with talking about the growth rate in 2016. I mean, one of the reasons why we felt compelled to provide a lot of detail around '16 and '17 is, as we go about the, what I'll call, the rationalization of our portfolio, the timing of when those sales go away will certainly have an impact on what you should expect, as what we expect, for 2016. And then we return to what I'll call a rebased model in 2017. So 2 things affecting '16: one, as you correctly point out, is Venezuela hitting the operational rate; and the second is, the timing of the SKUs that we're pruning from the portfolio when we start to see a decrease in sales. You note that we, for the balance of '15, expect -- did not show you a line item reducing our revenue expectations associated with the reduction in the SKUs in the portfolio. That really starts to come into play in 2016 and we should enter '17 clean.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So let me answer the question on M&A. So definitely, M&A is part of our strategy, and we are considering any M&A opportunity that will increase the value of this company and will support our objective in terms of generating higher margins in our operations. So where is our interest? Any opportunity which is in the animal health domain. We think that we have all the capabilities, and also now we have, or will have, even much better ratios in terms of cost and in terms of expenses to revenue, so we can really maximize opportunities of any potential acquisition.","Operator","And we can take that question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wonder if you'd -- try and elaborate a little bit more on the operational efficiency initiative here. I guess in the past, you've talked a lot about your direct selling model being a competitive advantage versus some of your peers. Can you just elaborate a little bit more with the decision today in the smaller markets to move to more of an indirect model? Just what's changed in terms of that view? Is it that these were markets that were never going to get the scale you needed to justify the investments you're making? I'm trying to understand a little bit more the strategic shift that you're making on those. Second question is just with the new kind of plan as you're aligning your approach here. Are there any management incentives that you're putting in place or any changes to management incentive that are going to come about as a result of this operational efficiency plan as we think about the 2015 targets, et cetera?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Chris. And what we are trying with this initiative is to be much more focused. And we mentioned many times that our diversity, or the breadth of our business, it was a competitive advantage. But we have also identified some areas or some elements of this diversity, which is adding a complexity, which is a barrier to deliver value to our customers and also to create that value to Zoetis. What we are trying is we've now been much more focused on the countries and also the products that will generate the highest value to Zoetis. It's to really move away from our model, which is a model that will be 100% applicable to those markets, and we are now in these small markets in -- where we don't see that the model is efficient in terms of our profitability, and then moving to a model that will be indirect and will be relying more on distributors to support our revenues. So the strategy is not changing. What we are, it's really focused on the market that would generate the highest opportunities for Zoetis and also the product that will integrate the highest revenues to our company and the most profitable growth. In terms of the management incentives, we have in place programs to incentivize our leaders in Zoetis for exceeding the $300 million target that we have in our program. So we have these plans and we are convinced that we'll be working to meet or exceed our objectives.","Operator","We'll take that question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America.","Erin E. Wilson - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Does the new guidance on the top line include contributions in Sarolaner, and could that still provide upside? And do you have cash flow forecast for us? And I think you gave some color here, but does your guidance include share repurchases and plans for deleveraging?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So let me answer the first question, and then Paul will answer the second one. Thank you, Erin, for both your questions. So the new products, Sarolaner, IL-31, are not part of our guidance today. So we are in process of discussing with the FDA and USDA and other regulators. So once we have more understanding of the timing of these product launches, we'll incorporate in our guidance.","Paul S. Herendeen","And it's Paul, I'll speak to the cash flow guidance. We're not providing -- we provided an awful lot of detail on the operating side here through 2017. We're not, at this time, providing a forecast of cash flow and our balance sheet, but suffice it to say that we talked in the past about our desire to improve our asset efficiency. For example, through the implementation of our global ERP system, SAP, we expect that over time, we'll be able to reduce our investment in our inventory and unlock some cash there. Frankly, by paring down our business and pruning our portfolio, with the SKUs, that will unlock some cash -- cash as well. We do have an awful lot of calls on our cash here coming up in the very near term. I mean, if you think about it in the first quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. We do continue to use cash to fund the onetime costs associated with our separation from Pfizer, and we've provided an estimate of the remaining amount of that to be somewhere in the range of $180 million to $210 million. We provided you with an estimate of the cost of the efficiency initiative that we announced today and the early stages of our supply network strategy, and those costs are estimated in the range of $300 million or $400 million to $500 million over the next several years. And we have, I'll call it out for you, the $400 million debt maturity coming up next spring. And then we have our regular dividend coming up. So we do have some sizable calls on our cash. We have actually provided you also with some guidance, a little bit of guidance at this stage around our share repurchases. We indicated that we expect to purchase, in aggregate, $100 million worth of shares over the first half of 2015 and that we can -- expect to continue acquiring shares in the amount that will at least offset the ongoing dilution from our equity-based compensation plans. And I said in the past, I'll say it again, the share repurchase will be an ongoing part of our plans for our capital allocation. I think of it -- share purchase activity that underlies our 2017 guidance as a baseline for that activity. As we generate either free cash or debt capacity, we'll adjust our plans there as appropriate. Did I cover it all? Sorry, the deleveraging question as well. Yes, we have stated in the past that we have kind of a notional -- when we talk about our capital structure, a notional floor of gross debt to trailing 12-months EBITDA of 2.5x. So I want to reiterate there's a permanent role for debt in our capital structure, and when you think about that cap structure, we remain committed to be responsible stewards of our shareholders' capital. And our hierarchy for that capital allocation will be first and foremost inside our business; second for business development activity that is value-generative; and lastly, transactions and shareholders including both the regular dividend and the ongoing share repurchases. So again, think of that 2.5x as a floor and think of our hierarchy of capital allocation as I outlined it for you. I hope I answered the question.","Operator","And we can take our next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets Equity Research","We appreciate all the details on the efficiency program. EuAfME sales were below expectations. Could you comment on the impact of the new anti-infective legislation in France and whether you think that's going to spread to other developed markets. And Paul, I'm not sure if you addressed this, but how much of your lower OpEx this quarter was driven by FX as opposed to other savings? And then, finally, could you comment on the launch of APOQUEL and whether your prior guidance still stands.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Alex. So the situation in Europe\/Africa\/Middle East, revenues were affected by the France performance. So they announced the new legislation related to anti-infective legislation. It's eliminating rebates offered by animal health manufacturers to both wholesalers and veterinarians. And as a result of this elimination of rebates, there was an adjustment in the market in terms of inventory levels. We expect that this will be, in the next quarter, compensated and back to normal situation. And now Paul will answer the comment also in terms of the impact of FX.","Paul S. Herendeen","Yes, Alex, and there's really 2 ways you and think about this. First is you can see the impact, the impact on the first quarter alone, on SG&A expenses in the quarter was roughly 5% change was due to FX, and in R&D, it was 2%. I think a more helpful way to think about it might be to look at our guidance bridge slide going from our previous guidance in February to our updated guidance today. And you can see the expected impact on the full year relative to that February guidance is roughly $20 million on SG&A expenses and none on R&D.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And then the comment on the APOQUEL. So in the first quarter of this year, the revenues of APOQUEL have been still facing limited supply. But from April, we have been able to meet the demands of our customers in U.S., also U.K. and Germany, and we expect that the product will meet our expectations in 2015 of delivering $150 million to $175 million in 2015. And we also are planning now in launching APOQUEL in additional markets that will be also making contribution to meet these expectations for the product.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","[Technical Difficulty]","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","We have some problem there with the line?","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI, Research Division","So the question is about incremental form of [indiscernible]. So the question about M&A and the Tax Matters Agreement with Pfizer that I believe expires next month. So your new cost reduction plan and Tax Matters Agreement expiration, whether this will change your overall strategy for future acquisitions, M&A, and whether you're still open for targets of various size or -- and think about the ZTS as -- more as a net acquirer, not acquisition target. As well as if you're still open for potentially inversion transaction as an avenue to reduce effective tax rate.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","So let me mention on the tax agreement that you're right, this tax agreement will end on June 24. We mentioned on previous calls that this is something that will eliminate any restrictions, but we didn't think that it was a significant restriction for any type of transaction related to acquisition or licensing or any other divestment. In terms of the new program, its changing our strategy, we think that our strategy has been always to consider M&A opportunities that will create value to Zoetis and will create more value to our shareholders. Definitely, the new program will generate more cash, and more cash also will help us to consider any kind of opportunity. In terms of inversion, I think again, so we are open to any opportunity that will increase the value to our shareholders and is something that we'll be always open. But we know there are not too many options that we can consider in terms of inversion or acquisition of our company that will facilitate this kind of tax strategy.","Paul S. Herendeen","I'll just follow on, in that I think that with our leaned-out structure, we will be better positioned to realize value from acquisitions that we might consider. I mean as -- looking backwards, using as a great example, the Abbott Animal Health assets. When you have a better cost structure and you can absorb those and realize the synergies, you can gain better value over assets that you're able to acquire. As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, I want to buttress that as well. We're always thinking about ways that we can build value here, and one of those ways is through smart business development activity.","Operator","We can take that question from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on an earlier question, about trying to trim assets [ph]. Clearly what you're doing makes a kind of sense, simplifying a very complex cost structure, it's -- reasons why companies spin off assets and those assets tend to perform much better as separate companies. But I'm actually kind of surprised, Juan, when you said your expectation is that revenue growth -- you sort of reiterated the type of organic growth that you have been anticipating, which is the market growth of 5% to 7%. I would think, with shrinking the revenue base and getting out of slower growth or less profitable businesses, that would give you an opportunity to accelerate top line growth, and wondering if you can just talk about that.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Jami, and I think you are right in your comment. We are doing that because we think that being much more focused will be an opportunity to accelerate growth in products, markets that will be important to our future profitable growth, and this is something that definitely we will be working to ensure that the programs that will stay in our portfolio will generate maximum opportunities. The other important thing is that we also want to make sure that we increase our supply to our customers on those problems that really matter to them. And we want to have a reliable supply and to eliminate the risk for product supply issues that's always very, very different [ph] to our customers. So with being much more focused we are convinced that we can generate a higher profitable growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","You talked about a changing approach to R&D. Can you just elaborate a little bit on that? And one specific one. Do you still expect Sarolaner to reach the market by spring of '16? But then more broadly, what are the source of products that you're refocusing the R&D efforts on? Is there any criteria around, let's say, region or animal species?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you for the question, John. And in terms of R&D, so we are eliminating 5,000 SKUs. So if we are eliminating about 40% of our total SKUs, you can also assume that we'll be eliminating some of the programs that are a very important part of our investment. And just to remind you, almost 50% or even more of our R&D investment is related to life cycle management. So if we are eliminating 40% of our SKUs, we should be also eliminating programs in life cycle management that are supporting this part of the portfolio. We also think that it's a good opportunity also for us to identify the future problems that will generate the highest potential in the animal health industry. We have been extremely successful in identifying these opportunities, and APOQUEL is a good example, but also our progress on bringing back vaccines to the market like PEDv vaccine and many other vaccines that we have been introducing is a good example of being focused, identifying these opportunities. It's a great opportunity for us like this. We'll remain doing that and we are not changing our approach in R&D, but we are trying to identify those projects that would generate the highest return to our company. In terms of Sarolaner, we are working with the FDA. We are presenting all the information that FDA is requesting, and we expect that the program will be launched in 2016.","Paul S. Herendeen","Before we ask the next question, it's Paul, and I just want to jump in. R&D is, as I said in my prepared remarks and Juan Ram\u00f3n referenced as well, that's 1 of our 3 key interconnected capabilities and one where we're not changing substantially here. What we're looking for is ways that we can improve the process by which we select projects to go into the queue and then come out on the other end. And John, the way you phrased your question was almost exactly the way I've talked about this inside, is the alignment of our portfolio around our key brands and around our key regional strategies for growth, and ensuring that this course alignment of our R&D strategy around those key brands and regional strategies. And as I say all the time, any process -- and we've been very productive in R&D. Any process that we have can be improved and that's what we're doing here, call it, continuous improvement.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company.","Kathleen M. Miner - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow up a little more on the 5,000 SKUs that will be eliminated. Can you give us a little more color on them? Such as how many products this might include and will we see a change in your therapeutic product mix post the elimination of these products? And second, just a quick question on the antibody for atopic dermatitis that you expect conditional approval for, is that still on track for the end of this year?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Kathy, and definitely, these 5,000 SKUs are not 5,000 products. The number of products is much lower. I don't think we have provided the number of programs that will be affected. It's something that definitely, we plan to provide this information to our customers in the next coming weeks, and we also plan to send a communication to our customers on those programs that will be affecting every market. In terms of the change of the mix, well, the mix will improve in terms of profitability, so these products, as we mentioned, are low margin. So by eliminating these low-margin products, we'll improve our margin and mix and this will have a positive impact in our operations. IL-31 is still on track for conditional approval in 2015. We are working with the USDA and we expect this conditional license approval anytime at the end of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Liav Abraham with Citi.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a quick question on the sales force. If I understood correctly, the reduction in the sales force that you proposed is only from the sales force that's associated with products or regions that you're exiting, and you don't anticipate any curtails in sales force in the regions that will remain ongoing. Is that correct? I just want to make sure that I understood that correctly.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you for the question, Liav.","Paul S. Herendeen","I'll take it.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","No the reduction on the field force, it's mainly related to those markets that we are planning to change our model, moving from direct to indirect. Also, in some of the markets, so we are also adjusting our field force to the real potential of our portfolio. We are not changing our field force in key markets like the U.S. We have some small adjustments in some markets in Europe, which is also the reflect of the market potential of those markets. But basically, we are maintaining our presence in the market. So we are convinced that our direct interaction with the customer represent a significant competitive advantage and we are planning to protect these interactions and continue interacting there with customers on a daily basis. And again, I want to insist that in most of the markets, there is no any change in the infrastructure of our field force. What is something that is applicable not only to the field force but to the rest of the organization: we are also considering being much more efficient in terms of span of control. And this will imply some elimination of layers, also in the field force, but not in the people that have customer-facing interactions.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David Risinger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the 2 segments of the company, companion and livestock. Could you just characterize the different margins for the 2 business segments? I don't know how much detail you can provide, but I was hoping that you could help to provide a baseline for us in terms of where the operating margins stand for each of the segments? And then looking ahead, which of the 2 is the 1 that will experience greater margin expansion over the next 3 years.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, David. So let me start by mentioning maybe the difference between companion animal and livestock in terms of gross profit. So in terms of gross profit, companion animal, it's generating the highest margins, and you know that we have a margin of -- a gross profit of 65%. The net companion animal is much higher than this 65%. And then livestock, we have a different margin depending on cattle, swine or poultry. Being in poultry, the lowest in terms of our gross profit and, cattle, the highest in terms of our gross profit in livestock. But then you also need to add what is the cost to win these products to the customers. And then in that case, I think the total margins are much more equalized. So companion animal require a significant much more field force and promotional activities because the number of our customers in companion animal it's much higher than in livestock. And then poultry is the most consolidated industry, so it require fewer individuals to reach the customers, while cattle still require a significant number of people to reach these customers. So even gross profit are different across different species. In terms of the total margin, the margins are much more similar. And we think that there are opportunities in both. We have been growing livestock faster than companion animal in the recent years. Now with APOQUEL, with Sarolaner, with Abbott, with IL-31, we expect that companion animal will generate a significant growth in our operations.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we can take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up here. I guess going back to the SKUs that are going to be eliminated. Paul, did I miss -- did you provide how much revenue those products are going to generate or what the impact would be from the SKU elimination in 2016? And then also in the press release, you talked about the feed additive for the poultry, Zoamix. Just wondering how big that could get. And I guess what's your thought, Juan Ram\u00f3n, on the scrutiny and some of the restaurant companies eliminating using antibiotics in the chickens, especially -- oh, and also, thoughts on the avian flu.","Paul S. Herendeen","I'll start. Yes, the first question with respect to the period SKUs. We did not provide a specific amount or impact on our 2016 just to say that, by definition, we included the impact as we provided the detailed guidance for 2016. And then call your attention to 2017 where we call it out and it's really $280 million of top line that we expect, relative to our prior expectations, for 2017. And the way I would think of it is 100 is a curious thing with this $10 million of OpEx that maps the cost of goods sold. So the table, you'll see the $290 million versus $300 million, but with $300 million OpEx, you think like $280 million and $100 million, that's the impact on '17 when it's fully reflected in our re-based revenues and that's how I think about it.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And on the majority of this key SKU elimination will take place in 2016. So we should expect that there will be an impact in terms of revenues in 2016 that would be very close to this $280 million that Paul just mentioned. So we have not mentioned the exact revenues of Zoamix in the U.S. But what we mentioned is that this has been compensating the rotation of products that are in the industry. It's using it as a way to protect the animal health in the poultry industry. In terms of -- you also asked about the comments on poultry and antibiotics of a recent company that has been issuing a press release in the U.S. Definitely, we are fully aligned with the FDA objective to reduce the impact of -- or the resistance of antibiotics in animal health. These 2 companies have announced that they will eliminate the use of human health products in poultry. In some cases, like Tyson, we have been already working with Tyson some years ago to eliminate these products. And because we have, in our portfolio, alternative to the products which are important for human health, we think that we'll be able to supply to companies in the poultry in the U.S. that will be eliminating gradually the use of human health products, which are important or antibiotic which are important for human health. With all the alternatives that we have in our portfolio, that we also keep the poultry industry productive and also protecting animals against infections.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just was trying to just dig a little bit more into the motivating factor that's leading you to this broad restructuring. I guess my question, are you seeing the market changing? Or is this really that you've gotten out of Pfizer, you've had the chance to review the broader strategy, that you're just having time now to dig into these business units and really try to focus the organization overall? I'm just trying to understand, higher level, what led you down this path to begin with?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay, this program has been part of our plans since the beginning. So it means we have separated from Pfizer. We had, in our thinking, that we should generate greater efficiencies and also define cost-saving opportunities. We also knew that in the first 2 years as a public company, we needed to focus on standing up our infrastructure. Also making sure that we are meeting our objectives in terms of revenue growth, also our objectives in terms of profit growth. We also needed to have full control of our operations. And when I mean full control of our operations, have a full understanding of our corporate functions, also full understanding of manufacturing and, also very important, control of our IT systems. We also decided early in the process of separating from Pfizer to invest in the new ERP. And now that the ERP has been already implemented in certain markets in Europe and went live in the U.S. at the end of April, we see that we are in the process to finalize all these implementations in the first quarter of 2016. With all these elements, I think we are in the position to identify these opportunities to be more efficient, and not only opportunities to be more efficient, but the opportunity to be much more focused. And I want to seize the complexity that we have in some of our operations. It's a barrier to deliver value to our customers. And this is one of the objectives that we have as part of this program, to ensure that we deliver higher value to our customers by being much more focused on certain problems in certain markets.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time, so I'll turn the floor back over to Juan Ram\u00f3n for any additional or closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Well, thank you very much for joining us for today's call.

I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to say that in 2016, we delivered our fourth consecutive year of operational revenue growth and improved profitability since becoming a public company. We completed a significant initiative to shape our business for greater efficiency and cash generation. And we continue to make investments that will sustain our future growth, innovation and market leadership. Our growth in 2016 was driven by the successful launch of several new products. The strength of our diverse portfolio and a deeper commitment to the direct customer relationships, productive R&D and high quality manufacturing that are the foundation of our business model.","Let me highlight some of the headlines for 2016. We delivered on our financial goal for the year despite some challenging market conditions for livestock producers, especially in the U.S. We generated 5% operational growth in revenue for the full year, and 8% growth based on a normalized organic operational view that Glenn will discuss in his remarks. As expected, our companion animal portfolio led the way with 13% operational growth, thanks to Apoquel and other new product launches.","Our livestock portfolio grew 1% operationally, overcoming the negative revenue impact of our producer rationalization initiative, and business changes in Venezuela and India. We posted 17% operational growth in adjusted net income and improved our adjusted EBIT margin to 32%. These measures demonstrate the positive impact of our operational efficiency changes and the benefits of new product launches like Apoquel.","We were able to deliver these strong results on innovation while implementing important changes to our business last year. For example, we completed the implementation of our ERP system, which has really given us more efficient tools and better visibility across our operations. We eliminated approximately 5,000 low revenue, low margin SKUs from our product portfolio. And we have sold or exited six manufacturing sites. During 2016, we strengthened our industry leadership with more than 200 product approvals including Cytopoint in the U.S., the first monoclonal antibody approved to help dogs suffering from atopic dermatitis; Simparica, our new oral parasiticide and several new wonder vaccines. We continue to look at this productive R&D engine as critical to our future and we spend more on R&D than any of our peers.","We also continue to see the value of investing in external business development opportunities. Last year, we acquired Scandinavian Micro Biodevices in the diagnostic space for approximately $80 million. And our prior acquisition of PHARMAQ contributed $90 million in revenue in 2016, while achieving rapid adoption of its ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine for salmon. Fish farmers in Chile have responded very favorably to the interaction of this vaccine.","Finally, we returned $488 million in excess capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. And we announced plan for a multi-year $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, beginning in 2017. All of these investments are consistent with capital allocation priorities we have shared with you in the past. All of the work that we have done in 2016 and in previous years such as building our infrastructure, investing in new systems and becoming more efficient has positioned us for success in 2017 and beyond. In 2017, we will target operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5% and continue improving our adjusted EBIT margin as we realize the full benefit of our operational efficiency initiative this year. All the major actions of the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015, has been implemented and we expect to exceed the initial target of $300 million in savings in 2017.","These additional savings will be used to support our short- and long-term growth in several ways. In 2017, we plan to initiate direct-to-consumer marketing and advertising campaigns in the U.S. for two of our companion animal products. In the case of Apoquel, we want to increase awareness of atopic dermatitis among pet owners, especially those whose dogs maybe suffering from acute conditions. And in the case of Simparica, we want to illustrate the advantages of our products and increase our share of voice in the highly competitive parasiticide market. These campaigns will include national television ads and digital promotions online. They are targeted to begin in the first half of this year.","We'll also support new product launches like Cytopoint, which was approved in the U.S. last year and Stronghold Plus, which is expected to be launched this year in the European Union. Stronghold Plus is a topical parasiticide for cats that combines sarolaner, the active ingredient of Simparica with selamectin, the active ingredient in our current Stronghold and Revolution product lines. This is our first combination product for sarolaner. This is a great example of how we use an R&D focus on lifecycle innovation to expand our platform and maintain a durable and valuable product line for decades.","We also will remain focused on improving the way we interact with and support our customers. Our people and technology are important parts of any customer experience and they remain critical areas of investment. For example, we'll be deploying new tools and capabilities on our ERP system and we have been expanding our field force in markets like Brazil and China where we see significant and sustainable growth opportunities. We also see R&D, manufacturing and business development as areas where we will allocate increased capital this year to support our long-term growth plans. Our internal R&D products will help discover new products as well as develop lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 product lines. Our business development team will continue exploring acquisitions, partnerships and alliances that enable us to fill gaps in our portfolio, and expand that further in complementary spaces and geographies.","And we will continue executing our long-term supply network strategy to improve the quality and reliability of key growth platforms in manufacturing. We have become the profitable business and market leader we always envisioned when we launched in 2013, and the outlook for Zoetis in 2017 is very positive. We expect to see stronger growth from our companion animal portfolio again this year, driven by our dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and ongoing uptake of our new vaccines. And in our livestock portfolio, we expect a recovery and improved growth across our cattle, swine, and poultry species.","In the case of fish, we expect that PHARMAQ to capitalize on the success of the new ALPHA JECT LiVac SRS vaccine in Chile. And we recently received a favorable legal ruling in Norway, the world's largest farm salmon market, which will allow us to launch our vaccine for salmon pancreatic disease this year, a great result and opportunity that demonstrates the value we saw for this acquisition.","In closing, we are proud of our ability to deliver better than expected results in 2016, despite the market challenges we faced and the business changes we implemented. I want to thank all our Zoetis colleagues for their commitment and personal contribution to these results. As we look ahead in 2017, we see a brighter future. We have reshaped our business for long-term profitable growth based on our diverse portfolio, customer focus, innovative R&D, high-quality manufacturing, and improved capital efficiency. I thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence in Zoetis, and look forward to reporting to you on our progress.","With that, let me turn things over to Glenn. Glenn?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Before discussing the fourth quarter and 2017 guidance, let me offer a quick perspective on the full year. We delivered revenue and adjusted EPS at the high end of our guidance ranges. Our new companion animal products, increased efficiency, and margin improvements all helped drive that performance throughout the year.","Operational revenue growth for the year was 5%, but a better indicator of our underlying performance is what we refer to as our normalized organic operational growth, that was 8% for the year. It excludes the negative impact of our operational efficiency initiative and the positive impact of M&A. You can find the details of these items in the tables on our website. Of this 8% growth, 5 percentage points came from new products, including Apoquel, 3 percentage points came from the in-line portfolio, with 2 points of that from price and 1 point from volume. This will be the last quarter that we will report our normalized revenue growth metric, as our operational efficiency initiative will have only a small impact on our revenue in 2017.","There will be some continued drag in our revenue growth from product rationalization, especially in the first two quarters of the year, and we will help you understand the magnitude of those items as we go through 2017. As we said in the past, we take a long-term view of our business, and prefer to assess our financial performance on an annual basis, rather than taking a quarterly focus.","During the year, we saw many of the familiar seasonal fluctuations that occur in our industry. But as we progressed through the year, our expectations for outperformance steadily increased. Our team delivered on those higher expectations, with 17% operational growth in adjusted net income compared to the 6% to 12% we expected at the beginning of the year. This success demonstrates the strength of our diverse portfolio and business model, and it builds on many years of strong performance. We are especially pleased to have achieved these results during a period of significant change in how we operate our company.","Turning to the quarter, we delivered double-digit operational growth in adjusted net income, overcoming the negative impact to revenue of fewer calendar days and business changes related to our operational efficiency initiative. Both reported and operational revenue growth were flat for the quarter. We saw no impact from foreign exchange to revenue, unlike many of our prior quarters. Our operational efficiency initiative reduced revenue by 3%, and fewer calendar days in the quarter had approximately a 4% impact.","M&A activity, primarily PHARMAQ, contributed 2% to our revenue growth. PHARMAQ was below our revenue projections for the year, but we feel very good about the value we're getting from this acquisition. Our positive views are supported by the strong performance of our SRS vaccine in Chile and a recent legal win in Norway that opens the door to an important category in the aquaculture market. These two PHARMAQ drivers represent a meaningful portion of the value we saw in this company. While market conditions in Chile were challenging in 2016, the long-term structural drivers of growth that attracted us to the aquaculture market remain intact.","Going back to our overall results, our normalized organic operational revenue growth was 5% in the fourth quarter. Again, this backs out the negative effects of our operational efficiency initiative, fewer calendar days in the quarter, and the benefit from M&A. This growth was balanced between our geographic segments on a normalized basis, with international growing 6% and the U.S. growing at 5%. In both segments, the main growth driver was new companion animal products. We continue to see strong growth of Apoquel and our vaccine franchises, and we're steadily establishing Simparica in the U.S. and other markets.","In the U.S., we continued to absorb the decline in surgical fluid products. This was partially offset, however, by additional sales in the quarter as we expanded distributor relationships on other products. The U.S. companion animal grew 7% on a normalized basis. U.S. livestock grew 3% on a normalized basis, with growth in cattle and poultry offset by declines in swine. Market conditions in cattle continue to be difficult, and results were somewhat lighter than expected in the fourth quarter. However, our U.S. cattle business delivered low-to-mid single-digit growth on the same normalized basis for the quarter and year, despite very challenging market conditions for our beef and dairy customers. Again, this demonstrates the resiliency of the animal health industry and Zoetis even in challenging market conditions.","International companion animal normalized growth of 16% was supported by new product contributions as well as higher levels of medicalization in emerging markets, a fundamental long-term structural driver of our business. 2% normalized growth for international livestock was supported by growth in China, Mexico and Brazil; offset by lower usage of antibiotics in Western Europe. You can see the full results of our top 11 markets in the table, but let me highlight a few items.","Growth in key emerging markets, like Brazil and China, continues to be strong. Operational revenue growth in Brazil of 8% was driven by price, new companion animal products, and favorable cattle conditions. High demand for beef exports from Brazil more than offset the difficult market conditions in poultry and swine where producers saw higher input prices.","Operational growth in China of 17% was driven by continued strength in the swine market and growth in companion animal vaccine due to increases in routine care. For the year, China grew 24% operationally, our fourth consecutive year of double-digit growth since becoming public. Our recent field force expansions in Brazil and China have been productive, and we'll continue to deploy selling resources in these and other markets where we see significant and sustainable growth drivers combined with high returns on our investments. Emerging market growth was not limited to Brazil and China. Our other emerging markets category grew 6% operationally.","Now turning to the rest of the P&L, I'll quickly cover a few items of note in the quarter and then move to a review of guidance. Adjusted gross margin increased 110 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis, primarily due to favorable foreign exchange, which was partially offset by higher inventory charges. Adjusted other income included a $15 million charge for the devaluation of the Egyptian pound that occurred in November, after our most recent guidance update.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. This rate included the effects of discrete items and the jurisdictional mix of earnings. This brought our full year adjusted tax rate to 30%, which was two points below our guidance for the year. Adjusted net income grew 13% operationally, despite the fewer selling days in the quarter. GAAP net income grew significantly on a reported basis in the quarter. This was due to the charge in the year-ago quarter related to the currency devaluation in Venezuela, as well as lower stand up and operational efficiency costs. Versus our full year guidance, our one-time costs were above the range as we settled the product dispute with poultry customers in Mexico and had higher than expected severance cost associated with our efficiency initiative.","In the quarter, we also incurred a net tax charge as a result of the implementation of certain operational changes, including the revaluation of tax assets associated with the change in our operating model. All-in-all, Q4 was a good quarter wrapping up a great year. We delivered a normalized organic operational growth of 8%, adjusted gross margin improvement of almost 200 basis points, 23% operational growth in adjusted EBIT and 17% operational growth in adjusted net income.","Now, let's talk about guidance for full year 2017. We are updating our previous guidance for changes in foreign exchange rates, since our last update in November. Our guidance now reflects rates as of late January, which reduced revenue guidance by approximately $50 million and adjusted EPS by $0.03. On an operational basis, our guidance is unchanged. We have however updated our growth rates to reflect the higher base of revenue, and income achieved in 2016. For the year, we expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5.5% to 7.5%, and adjusted EBIT margin of 34% and 35%, and operational growth in adjusted net income of 15% to 20%.","We continue to see companion animal driving much of our growth in 2017. We will have additional penetration of Apoquel including its expansion into more acute and seasonal cases. We will continue the launch of Cytopoint in the U.S. as we build our dermatology portfolio, and we will see additional market penetration of Simparica, as well as the launch of Stronghold Plus in Europe.","All of the necessary actions to deliver our 2017 efficiency goals were largely completed by the end of 2016. We expect to deliver more than the $300 million in savings we initially targeted, some of which we will be investing back in the business. Despite the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter, our guidance for adjusted ETR is unchanged. We do not expect the favorable discrete items from Q4 to recur. Our guidance for adjusted ETR is based on current U.S. tax law, and does not take into account any potential changes being discussed in Washington.","With more than half of our adjusted pre-tax income in the U.S., a lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate would have a meaningful benefit to us. There are also other items that can impact our taxes going forward, such as border adjustability and the impact of deemed repatriation. We will be in a position to articulate the potential effect of these items as we gain more clarity. While we don't guide to quarters, I do want to reiterate my comments from last quarter that we expect to see our revenue and income growth weighted more significantly towards the second half of the year.","As a reminder, in 2017, we will face approximately $50 million drag on revenue growth from the product rationalization. This will disproportionally affect the first quarter. We are expecting first quarter gross margin to be generally in line with the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of recognition of cost of goods sold. We are also re-investing a portion of our additional cost savings, in investments in product launches and key brands like Apoquel, Cytopoint and Simparica early in the year. We expect to begin seeing the revenue effect of these investments in the second half of the year. The result is that we currently see limited adjusted income growth in the first half with significantly stronger growth later in the year.","A final point on capital allocation. We have completed our initial share repurchase program and in December, we announced the $1.5 billion authorization. We view this repurchase plan as multi-year and flexible in nature depending on other capital allocation priorities. We have increased the pace of our repurchase from last year to $125 million per quarter. This pace is related to the improved cash flow we expect in 2017 now that we are beyond the cost of our operational efficiency initiative.","Our guidance for adjusted diluted EPS assumes only that we offset dilution from equity awards. As a general rule, we view 2017 adjusted net income as a good proxy for the operating cash flow we expect to generate. We do expect to maintain CapEx in line with the last two years as we invest in manufacturing to deliver our in-line and new product growth.","So let me wrap up before we go to Q&A. We achieved our 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. And we affirmed our outlook for 2017 with updates for foreign exchange. We continue to see a path to continued margin expansion, increased cash flow and greater efficiency as we achieve the full benefit of our operational efficiency program. And we're prioritizing and funding investments in long-term growth in all of our core capabilities.","With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the lines for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And the floor is now open for questions. We'll take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I'm just curious on your priorities for capital allocation in 2017 and if you would continue to repurchase shares even with your stock at this price? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Louise. And we'll maintain the same capital allocation philosophy that we already shared with you. So, we'll continue investing in the business. We see opportunities this year of reinforcing our presence in the market with DTC campaigns, also expanding field forces in the markets. We'll continue investing in R&D because we consider that the productivity of R&D is very high and we have been delivering very strong products and we'll continue supporting our growth with this investment. We'll also invest in manufacturing, to ensure that we have the capacity, and the capabilities that we will need to support our future growth. And we'll also continue assessing external opportunities, business and developmental opportunities that will reinforce our internal growth. And any excess capital we will return to the shareholders through dividends or the program that we already announced for buying shares back.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. And just to add to that, Louise, we're currently in the market purchasing this quarter, we expect to purchase about $125 million in shares this quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. So can you talk a little bit about the new product launches? I mean, we had some positive feedback on Cytopoint talking to vets at the NAVC Conference. And just wanted to get your initial thoughts on that product and how we should look at expectations on that?","And I guess the other question is, it did look like you tweaked down your core growth guide by about 50 bps. I'm just sort of wondering what was behind that given that 4Q ended up exactly where we generally thought about it? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Derik. I will answer the first question and then I will ask Glenn to provide an answer to your second question. Cytopoint, definitely the feedback from the market is extremely positive. But also we want to consider not Cytopoint or Apoquel as separate. We want to consider now our dermatology portfolio, which is now even stronger than last year with Cytopoint, and we expect that the combination of these two products will cover all the needs of veterinarians when treating acute, chronic, or seasonalized atopic dermatitis or any type of skin condition.","So we are very excited about our portfolio. We are considering that Apoquel will continue growing and we're supporting Apoquel this year with additional resources in terms of DTC and some additional activities in the market. And this also will have an impact in the Cytopoint because, as I said, we'll consider the combined portfolio in dermatology as the way to deliver the value to our customers and to cover the needs in terms of treating itching conditions or atopic dermatitis.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","And in terms of the growth rates for 2017 on an operational basis, when we set the guidance back in November, since 2016 actuals were not final, we based the 2017 growth off the midpoint of those ranges. Now that we have final 2016 actuals and we came in towards the high-end of those ranges, the growth rates naturally declined. I do want to make it clear, the operational numbers themselves have not changed and in the core expectations for the business have not changed, except for the update to foreign exchange that we've reflected.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, good morning. Can you update us on your progress as you attempt to combine flea and tick and heartworm, and any possible timelines on that front? And in light of the Mars acquisition, can you provide some context on the long-term risk and opportunities associated with the consolidation of clinics? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay, thank you. Well, we have the first news on the products in terms of combining the flea, ticks, and heartworm because now we have topical product, which is a combination of the active ingredient of Simparica, sarolaner with the active ingredient of Revolution\/Stronghold that it's selamectin. And this product has been already approved in Europe and we plan to launch this product every soon in the European market. Definitely, this is only the first step. We'll continue working internally to combine the same principle of different agents to have broader spectrum of coverage in parasiticides, including internal parasiticides, in this case for dogs.","We have not yet provided the timing of the launch, but definitely our R&D team is working in this combo, but also working in future formulations that can also include injectable formulations and longer duration of protection. When we have more clarity on the timing, we'll provide an update on this information.","And then in terms of the clinic consolidation, so now Banfield that has around 900 clinics in the U.S. will be a consolidated with VCA that has another 800 clinics. So this will represent 1,700 to 1,800 clinics of a total of 30,000 clinics in the U.S. market for companion animals. We have good collaboration with both companies with Banfield and VCA, and we expect also to continue this collaboration.","Based on comments that we got from Banfield, it seems that they will keep these two networks independent, and we will continue working with Banfield as a group, and also with different clinics that are part of a network, to promote and to support our portfolios.","Operator","And our next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you speak to the recent shift in strategy and the rationale behind your direct versus third-party distribution strategy and how has there been \u2013 or has there been an evolution in the market that makes direct distribution less favorable to you, now that vaccines and parasiticides are opened up? And how much did those distributor shifts impact you in the current quarter, as well as in the first quarter, from a stocking perspective? How should we be thinking about the buying pattern?","And then my second question is, what does your guidance assume in terms of underlying growth across livestock versus companion animal, and the underlying fundamental trends assumed in your 2017 guidance? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Erin. So let me start with your question about the distribution strategy. And these are related, as you mentioned, to companion animal. In previous year, we had the exclusivity provisions for few products and with certain distributors. So in 2016, we extended the collaboration with distributors, adding vaccines, but on a non-exclusive basis, in this case for the vaccines.","So this year also, we included as part of the agreement with distributors, our parasiticide products. So Revolution, ProHeart 6, and Simparica. This will be part now of the agreement with distributors. With these extended partnership with distributors, we are confident that we'll be able to increase our share of voice and also penetration in veterinarian clinics.","Also the changes with distributors, with these changes, we have considered that it's much more attractive model to have that contract with the distributors based on total volume, rather than exclusivity, for a small number of products.","Having said that, also, we remain committed to our commercial model based on direct interactions with customers through highly qualified field force to generate demand for our products. And the result of all these changes is that we expect a positive impact in our business. And the outlook for generics is also something that maybe some questions in the market will remain unchanged from what we said in the past.","So, in summary, we are confident that this new model will be very attractive. We'll also have better support from distributors, while we'll maintain our presence (38:05) in the market with our direct interaction with the customers.","Glenn will talk about what has been the impact in terms of stock and revenues related to the change on the distribution.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Hi, Erin. In terms of the stocking impact for Q4, when you look at that and if you compare that to our total sales for the quarter, it's less than 1%, right. So if you're looking at the companion animal growth, there was a benefit of slightly less than 1% related to that. The offset to that in evaluating the companion animal growth, particularly in the U.S., is the impact of the surgical fluid business and the decline we saw there, that was slightly greater than the impact of the stocking.","To your question on the underlying trends in companion animal and livestock, as we've discussed, we do expect, again, companion animal to grow stronger than livestock in 2017. I think when you look at it, for 2016 on a normalized organic basis, right, growth in livestock was 4%, growth in companion animal was 14%. I think we'd expect that difference to come closer in 2017, but again, we'd expect companion animal to grow stronger.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks and good morning. Juan Ram\u00f3n, maybe just qualitatively, if you could talk about how do you feel about U.S. livestock? Back in the summer when conditions did not seem overwhelmingly favorable, you put up a good 3Q number, aided by promotions. This quarter U.S. livestock, I think you said up low-single digits operationally, although an easier comp, yet conditions seem to be getting better, especially as we enter 2017. So maybe just any color on increasing momentum that you see in U.S. livestock, specifically cattle?","And then quantitatively, Glenn, can you just provide Apoquel-specific numbers to the U.S. and international, and will we be getting that number going forward, or will it sort of be combined under the atopic dermatitis portfolio with Cytopoint? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jon. And let me go through the different species in livestock in the U.S., starting with cattle. So we expect, in the cattle business, for the market growth that will be 2% to 3%, and we expect to grow faster than the market in 2017. We expect also a slowdown in terms of herd expansion. Still, in 2017, we expect the herd will be continue growing. But something that is new is, we expect that in 2018 and 2019 also, this herd expansion will be now stable.","Beef prices continue being a challenge in the U.S. market, but still we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. And the dairy segment, in terms of profitability, is normalizing, which is also positive. So we will see also that the volume in terms of prevention and productivity will continue growing, and maybe will be a slowdown in terms of the use of anti-infective. As I said, 2% to 3% the market, and we are predicting that we'll be growing faster than the market.","In poultry, we expect flat to 1% market growth, and we expect a growth in this segment for Zoetis. So we'll see continued pressure on antibiotics, but we also have a portfolio that can be alternative to the antibiotics, which are considered as medically important for human, and we can offer alternatives that will generate growth in our portfolio.","And finally, pork, about 1% to 2% growth in the market, and again, we expect also to grow faster than the market, mainly driven by now the entrance of the new PCV2 vaccines in our portfolio that we expect to roll during the year. And we'll continue working on new combinations of vaccines or vaccines that will be adding antigen. That also will reinforce our position in pork.","Operator","And our next question...","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And in...","Operator","Go ahead.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","We have another question that Glenn will talk about.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So in terms of the sales for Apoquel and Revolution, so for Q4 we saw $70 million in sales of Apoquel. So in the U.S. we had $50 million of sales, which was a nice pickup sequentially from Q3 as we work through the inventory issues we discussed in the prior quarter, so a nice sequential growth in the U.S.","Internationally, we had $20 million in sales, which was a drop from Q3 as we expected. In the Q3 call, we talked a lot about the fact that there was some initial stocking in Japan. So, again, for the quarter total $70 million, and for the year we have $248 million of sales in Apoquel with a $170 million of that in the U.S. and $78 million international.","In terms of how we're going to disclose that moving forward, between Apoquel, Cytopoint, or the derm portfolio, we're still early on in that. We want to see how the mix evolves, and then we'll determine what's the best way to disclose the sales are moving forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brett Wong with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Brett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wondering if you can please talk to the expected growth in Brazil in 2017. You mentioned that it's going to continue to be strong. But should we expect the ongoing high-single digit operational growth there? And what will drive double-digit growth in that region? If you can talk to both livestock and companion that would be very helpful.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So thank you. So we stopped providing exactly rate of growth in Brazil. Definitely, we see Brazil market that will continue growing, growing in many different species, including companion animal. And that's why we decided also to expand our field force for companion animal in 2017, and we are also expanding our field force for cattle in 2017.","So we are investing in the market because we see the opportunities that this market will continue growing. And we see that this market will also grow in terms of export. So the projections for Brazil continue being very positive. Still one of the things that is difficult to predict in exactly how much will be the impact of the different discussions in terms of trade. But we are confident that maybe Brazil can have a benefit on all these trade discussions, including the export, that has been very strong in the past.","In companion animal, definitely we see the opportunity of increasing that medicalization in dogs. They will be also having the benefit of having the entire portfolio of Zoetis now approved in Brazil. We have Apoquel, we have also Simparica is something that definitely will help us to generate even faster growth in companion animal in this market. Next question.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ram\u00f3n, I think you said you guys exceeded your $300 million target for cost savings. Can you just maybe comment a bit on what were the lessons you learned there and what allows you to beat that goal? And remind us what your plan is to optimize the manufacturing footprint over the next couple of years? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, the lessons that we learned \u2013 and thank you for the questions, John \u2013 the lessons that we learned that we understood from the beginning that there were opportunities for being much more efficient. But at the same time, we went through a process of building the infrastructure, implementing ERP. And we considered that it was too much trying to implement everything at the same time. But when we have full control on our operations, we really focus on improving our efficiency.","And the result of this operational efficiency program is that, first, now we learned that managing so many SKUs is not adding any value to our customers. In the past, we tried to meet all customer needs in terms of not only products, but we remain with significant large number of products, but meeting expectations in terms of dosages, formulations that in many cases were adding only complexity and limiting our ability to be reliable in terms of supply. So this is one of the first lessons. So it's reducing complexity in terms of SKUs, in terms of market. It's providing to us the opportunity to be much more focused and provide more value to all our customers.","The second lesson is that the reaction of Zoetis team in terms of embracing all these opportunities. And really targeting all these savings, we serve the objective of not only being more efficient but also supporting our future growth in a way that that will be stronger. And I think is the last lesson that we learnt through the process is that definitely there were significant opportunities of eliminating non-added value activities. And these were related to marketing, it was related to some of the activities that we were doing in terms of meetings and travels that were not adding value to our growth and not adding value to our operations.","And we are very pleased what we have achieved. Definitely, we have now mobile that is (48:37) much more efficient in commercial, also in finance, and in many other parts of the company. But definitely, we learned that it's important to focus on improving profitability, but even more important than just improving profitability is ensuring the future growth of Zoetis. So then you asked about the plan to optimize manufacturing going forward. Maybe Glenn can cover this question.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the plan to optimize manufacturing going forward, I think there are essentially three major plants that are still set to be transitioned by 2020. And as we go through that transition and move a lot of those products, we expect to get another 200 basis points improvement in our gross margins, but those are the next major initiatives related to manufacturing. Next question.","Operator","And our next question...","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","...is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. With this you are marking the end of the SKU rationalization program. Should we assume that the Zoetis story becomes more focused on top line growth versus margin expansion? And Glenn, can you talk about how much more room you see for margins? I think you had guided to 34%, 35% this year, it's up about 1000 basis points since 2012. How much higher can that go and what are the key drivers of that improvement. Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jami, for the questions. The focus on revenue growth has been always a part of our objective. And what we achieved with this operational efficiency program, it's having more better allocation of resources to generate future growth. So the fact that now we were able to exceed the $300 million target, it's allowing us to invest in DTC, it's allowing us to expand our field force in certain markets, and also to invest in technology that also will support the interactions with customers. We are focused on revenue growth and we know that the revenue growth will be the only way to continue generating adjusted net income faster than revenue growth. But we also want to make sure that we generate profitable revenue growth. Glenn?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","In terms of continued margin expansion, so we do expect this year of 2017 to be between 34% and 35%, which is a significant improvement over where we've been historically. We do see further room for improvement, we talked about 200 basis points that we see in gross margin coming by 2020 and we also do expect to be able to grow our expenses slower than our growth in revenue moving forward.","That being said, we're not targeting a margin. We're going to look at the right investment opportunities and do what makes the most financial sense and provides the highest return going forward. But those are some of the key areas that will provide some additional margin opportunities as we move forward.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks and congratulations on a strong 2016. There has been some concerns about generic erosion in your base companion animal business in the U.S., excluding the new products like Apoquel, Simparica et cetera. Could you comment on that, because I think you mentioned that the growth in the segment was driven by the newer products, so should we expect the base business to decline?","And also just to follow-up on Simparica, what were the sales of Simparica now and what is the potential of this product in combination form? And forgive me if you've mentioned this, when should we expect the approval in the U.S. for the combination form as well? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Alex. So we don't see any change in the outlook for generics in 2017 or 2018. So we know that the generics will capture part of the market. We have been managing very well in the past and we don't see anything that is creating a change in terms of generic penetration. So we are very confident that there is many different aspects that are also supporting our portfolio. We have very strong brand equity. We are promoting many products in our portfolio, which is also allowing us to also to offer volume discounts. We are a company that is bringing significant innovation, which is also an important part of what is our reputation in the market. And we maintain a significant presence in terms of direct interaction with customers.","So all these elements are in my opinion supporting our portfolio and definitely we see that the generic will get part of the market. But no different what we have been communicated that over time, they can reach 20% to 40%, but definitely not in the first year as we have been demonstrated many times. So it's a very different market than human health, and I don't think things are changing that will increase the penetration of generics significantly.","At least for companies that maintain a significant presence in the market, they promote large portfolio and they have the reputation and the interactions with customers.","Simparica combo, I guess, that you referred to the product that has been recently approved in Europe, that it was a topical formulation for cats. We expect also to introduce this product in the market in the U.S. We don't have yet details or we have not provided the timing. Definitely, once we have more information, we'll provide these details. We file in the U.S., but it's FDA filing and it depend on the U.S. reviews, the timing of the approval and the launch of the product.","The rest of the portfolio, combining the combo products sarolaner with other active ingredients to include internal and external parasiticide for dogs, again, so it's something that we are working and will provide more details when we are progressing in this project.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","In terms of sales for Simparica that is something that we haven't disclosed. Performance this year has been in line with our expectations and we do expect peak sales for the product to be over $100 million. We expect it to be a blockbuster and we're also very focused on the platform that it provides us to have continued lifecycle enhancements related to that product.","Operator","And our next question from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks very much. Juan Ram\u00f3n, I was hoping that you could talk about the competitive landscape, some of your large competitors have merged in the past. My guess is that the disruption at Lilly may be normalizing now and maybe they will be a slightly stronger competitor in the next year or two, but that's just a guess on my part, I'd love to hear your perspective on that. And if you could talk about the other major consolidation, and whether that's good or bad for Zoetis? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, I will say that, rather than providing a general comment, maybe it's good to see what is the impact by species. First, on the consolidation of Boehringer Ingelheim with Merial. So in companion animal, the majority of the portfolio will be Merial. They will be adding some products, especially in pain, coming from BI. We don't see a significant change in the competition landscape in terms of companion animal.","For cattle is where we see that the combined portfolio will strengthen the position of the new company. In swine, basically portfolio will be the portfolio that BI had in the past, so no changes in the competitive landscape, and the same for the poultry. Poultry will be mainly the Merial portfolio. So we don't expect significant changes in terms of competition, in terms of species. They will have, definitely, a bigger critical mass. This critical mass they can help them in terms of investments, and also especially in smaller markets, and definitely will be a stronger competitor than the two companies separated.","At the same time, so the combined company, they will need to manage higher complexity, and I'm sure that they will manage in the future, but they will have to understand how to manage the diversity of this extended portfolio and also, they will be facing the distraction of the integration. So in 2017, probably we will see challenge and opportunities, not too big changes in terms of competition by species, and it's something that we are confident that we will be managing.","You asked about Elanco. Elanco has been reinforced with recent acquisition, but this is something that, it's already part of our competitive landscape. So we don't see that Elanco in 2017 will have a different type of challenge, in terms of competition, compared to 2016.","Operator","And our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And sorry if I missed this during the prepared remarks or during the Q&A, but could you break out price, the impact of price versus volume, if possible, on an organic operational revenue growth perspective, for the full year? And it does look like, on the margin, inflation starting to pick-up in the States, at least, I haven't looked at rest of world data, but given the business model of Zoetis, do you think pick-up in kind of core CPI is going to allow you to do a little bit more with price, or is that just not relevant? Thanks a lot, and good to hear your voice, Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, thank you, Mark. I think probably these questions will be answered by Glenn, he has all these details, and I'm sure that he can provide the answer.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Sure. In terms of the price volume growth for the year. So if we start with our normalized organic operational growth, right, of 8% for the year, about 5% of that comes from new products. So we'll classify that as volume, right. Then there is the remaining 3%. The remaining 3%, 2% of that comes from price and 1% volume. So in total, 2% price and 6% volume for the year, in terms of the impact that we have on a normalized basis.","And in terms of the impact of inflation on price, that's something, as we go across geographies, not just in the U.S., inflation is definitely a factor that we consider when setting our price increases. So it definitely does have an impact on how we set those increases annually.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Just a couple of quick ones here. Following up on the dermatology assets, can I just get an updated view in terms of peak sales potential when we think about Cytopoint and Apoquel, how large do you think that portfolio can become over time?","And the second one was on tax reform. I think you've clearly articulated the company would benefit from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, can you just elaborate a little bit more on border adjustment, I don't have (1:01:08) details at this point, but can you just give us a little bit of color in terms of, we think about your U.S. business, how much of that is manufactured in the U.S. versus ex-U.S., so when we get more details here, how much of the franchise would be affected? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. And I think we are not changing our projection that has been provided in the past for Apoquel, so we think that Apoquel will be generating more than $300 million on peak sales. How much is something that we'll see depending on also the market that will be also captured in Cytopoint. And we also think that, now that we have Cytopoint with a full license in the U.S., but still no Cytopoint in the rest of the world. I think it's important that we understand that the full potential of Cytopoint, and then we provide guidance on the combined portfolio, when we have this information. But we see that the Cytopoint will be adding revenues to the more than $300 million that we already communicated for Apoquel.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So, Chris. Specific to your question on border adjustability, when we look at that and we look at our imports and exports, we're essentially net neutral between imports and exports in the U.S. So in terms of the impact on tax reform, it's really going to depend on what the tax rates are on imports and exports to understand the impact of that. But from an overall number perspective in terms of what we import and what we export, we're essentially net neutral.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Co.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just one question, if you will. You mentioned the importance of R&D to the company. Can you give us an update on some of the either key areas you're looking at, or I know you've mentioned biologics as being of importance to you going forward, just any color you can provide going forward would be helpful? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So, in terms of biologicals, we will continue investing there heavily to develop new vaccines, to develop combination of vaccines. We also intend to reinforce our presence in cattle vaccines in Europe. We also want to develop a larger portfolio of vaccines in China, and we'll be developing a strategy to be having stronger presence of our teams in China, mainly for swine, but also with opportunities of other species.","So all areas of R&D investment, we are now using the platform of sarolaner to develop a new parasiticide. And we mentioned the approval of sarolaner with selamectin in Europe for cat topical formulation, and we'll continue investing in this platform to ensure that we're covering broader spectrum of parasiticides.","We also with Cytopoint, we have quite significant knowledge in terms of monoclonal antibody, and these monoclonal antibodies also will be targeting all the different indications including pain or including other therapeutic indications. And we're also targeting in livestock opportunities of improving profitability for productivity, improving productivity in livestock.","So we know that there are now products that are helping us with efficiencies. We think that there will be opportunity for adding new products that will support this additional productivity in livestock.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","And we will now open the floor for any follow-up questions. That's follow-up questions only, thank you.","Operator","And we can take the first follow-up from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks. It's follow-up on biologics there. I guess, what and maybe this depends on which indications you're focused on from a monoclonal antibodies standpoint, but will that fall under this FDA or the USDA jurisdiction? And how should we think about kind of the timeline of approval and commercial launch of those products?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, Cytopoint has been under the jurisdiction of USDA. We expect that other monoclonal antibodies will depend. We expect that the indication for pain will be under the jurisdiction of FDA, but this will depend. And there is a clear definition of who should be responsible for each type of product, and also with discussions with the regulators when we start developing the programs, then we will find which will be the final regulator that will be involved in the approval.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","And it appears we have no further questions, I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n for any closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you very much for joining us today and we'll continue with providing updates to our business in a regular basis.

Steve, you may begin.","Steve Frank - Zoetis, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis first quarter 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release, and the company's 8-K filing dated today, May 2, 2018. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that the fundamental drivers of the animal health industry remain strong. The adoption of pets and focus on their health and their wellness are leading to a steady increase in medicalization rates, as well as more interest in specialty care products.","A growing world population continues to require more efficient production of meat, eggs, fish and dairy products. Our livestock customers may face economic cycles, weather conditions, as well as fluctuations in their input cost and prices. These type of cycles will always exist, but the underlying need for healthy animals to produce safe and affordable food is essential.","As a leader in animal health, Zoetis has stayed well positioned to support our customers. We have been able to discover, develop and deliver valuable products and services to them, based on our best-in-class combination of direct sales, R&D and manufacturing capabilities. This has been our formula for success, and it remains that way in 2018.","In the first quarter, we continued generating profitable revenue growth, thanks to the quality and the diversity of our portfolio; also the innovations we bring to the market and the value we deliver to our customers. We achieved 7% operational growth in revenue, driven by the performance of our dermatology portfolio, as well as new products including vaccines.","We generated growth in the U.S. and across our major international markets, based on the sustained effort of our field force and targeted investments for the launch of new products and the support of our in-line portfolio. We also grew our adjusted net income by 34% operationally, based on revenue growth, improvement to our gross margin and the benefits from the recently enacted U.S. tax reform.","In terms of more revenue return, our Companion Animal products grew 11% operationally, and we expect another year of above-market growth in this part of our business. We see further opportunities for gaining share and expanding the market for our innovative dermatology products. We are extending our derm portfolio into new markets internationally, and putting our sales and marketing efforts behind them.","In the U.S. and in other select markets, we are continuing digital and direct-to-consumer campaign to expand awareness around atopic dermatitis and also to increase the overall category spend on canine itch. Our new parasiticide products based on the sarolaner molecule, Simparica, a chewable tablet for dogs, and Stronghold Plus, a topical formulation for cats, are also contributing to growth in Companion Animal products in the first quarter, along with our new canine influenza bivalent vaccine. All of this was developed internally at Zoetis and illustrates a positive return on our R&D investment.","On the Livestock side of our business, we generated 6% operational growth, led by stronger performance in our poultry products and growth in cattle and swine products as well. The conditions in the livestock market are stable and we expect to grow our cattle, poultry, swine and fish products in line with or faster than the overall market.","There are excellent growth opportunities in animal health across the cycle of healthcare, from prediction and prevention to protection and treatment. And we are using our stronger financial position to support investment for growth. The investment in R&D is a top priority for Zoetis, and we see opportunities to enhance our product line with new lifecycle innovation and to make new breakthrough discoveries.","In the first quarter, for example, we expanded our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with the approval in the U.S. of Fostera Gold PCV and Hyo. This is the first ever vaccine to contain both genotypes of PCV2 \u2013 2a and 2b and a study show it provide cross protection against the leading 2d genotype. It also provide the long duration for commercial PCV2 combination vaccines at 23 weeks. As I said, we'll maintain DTC advertising and other digital marketing campaigns similar to last year, and we have started increasing our field force support in diagnostics in key markets.","We are also executing our plans in manufacturing investments, which I have discussed recently. In fact, last week we held a groundbreaking ceremony in Suzhou, China for a new facility that will enable us to expand our vaccine manufacturing and R&D in that country.","As always, we'll identify and scrutinize external acquisitions and partnerships in areas where we have our gaps or where we can achieve more value from an existing business or asset.","In closing, we remain confident in the strength of our company and the opportunities to offer customers more integrated solutions across the entire cycle of healthcare. With this approach and our proven business model, we can generate long term growth for Zoetis and value for our shareholders.","With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our first quarter results and full year 2018 guidance.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. As Juan Ram\u00f3n indicated, we performed well again in the first quarter, delivering operational revenue growth above historical trends for the market and we grew adjusted net income at a faster rate than revenue.","Total company revenue in the first quarter grew 7% operationally excluding a favorable 4% impact from foreign exchange. Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by our in line portfolio which includes our key dermatology products. We also saw growth in new products, price and a strong Livestock performance across both our international and U.S. segments.","The breakdown of our 7% growth was 2% from price and 5% from volume. Of the 5% volume, 2% was from new products and 3% was from in line products including 2% from our key dermatology products. We experienced balanced growth again this quarter as virtually all therapeutic areas, key markets and core species contributed to revenue growth.","Adjusted net income grew 34% operationally, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate. Our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, once again surpassed the $100 million mark in revenue with sales in the quarter reaching $122 million. As we indicated on our earnings call last quarter, we expect to achieve more than $500 million in combined sales from APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT for the full year 2018.","Now let's discuss segment revenue. International revenue grew 11% operationally in the first quarter with Companion Animal operational growth of 19%, and Livestock operational growth of 7%. Companion Animal growth was largely driven by our key dermatology products APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus and increased medicalization rates in key emerging markets such as China and Brazil. Livestock benefited from growing demand for animal protein, new product introductions and the success of our field force.","Turning to some notable market performances in the quarter. In China, we grew 14% operationally, largely due to strength in Companion Animal, which increasingly represents a larger portion of our business there. An increasing companion animal population and medicalization of pets contributed to this growth. And our Fel-O-Vax vaccine continues to perform well as the only registered vaccine available for cats on the market.","In Brazil, sales grew 7% operationally with contributions from both the Companion Animal and Livestock businesses. Higher Companion Animal revenue in Brazil benefited from the continued growth of Simparic due to a strong return on the direct to consumer investment, co-promotion with key in line products such as Revolution and higher vet clinic penetration.","In cattle, investments in our field force have led to increased penetration and coverage in key regions within the market and we continue to see favorable export market conditions. In swine, increased sales of Vivax, or Improvac as it's known elsewhere, were driven by higher usage and greater penetration with larger customers. These increases were tempered by a decline in poultry.","Other markets also contributed to growth. Japan experienced operational revenue growth of 17% in the quarter with positive performance across all species. Growth came from APOQUEL as a result of the timing of distributor purchases last year and the additional market penetration we achieved in the first quarter.","Australia grew 14% operationally with strength across all species, particularly poultry and cattle. In poultry, the growth was driven by an installation of hatchery devices related to KL Products, which was acquired in 2015. In cattle, our vaccine business grew due to strong beef prices and the rebuilding of the herd and the market.","Other emerging markets, particularly Russia and Poland, performed well. Russia had increased sales of medicated feed additives in poultry. And in Poland, we had the benefit of milk price stabilization and a cattle sector recovery based on producer consolidation.","To summarize, a very strong quarter for our international segment with growth across a diversified portfolio. Favorable market conditions, a return on strategic investments in our portfolio and field force and a focus on execution are all helping to consistently drive commercial results.","Turning to the U.S., revenue grew 5% in the first quarter with all species contributing to growth. Companion Animal grew 6% while Livestock grew 4%. Companion Animal sales in the quarter were driven primarily by our dermatology portfolio and a number of recently launched products. These gains were partially offset by decreases in certain in line products and Simparica.","U.S. dermatology sales were $83 million for the quarter with both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT exhibiting strong growth over the same quarter in the prior year. As anticipated, Q1 revenue was in line with Q4 and we expect higher sales in Q2 and Q3 with the warmer weather driving seasonal activity.","Simparica declined over the same quarter of 2017 due to the timing of customer purchases in Q1 and Q2 of last year. We expect this product to grow in Q2 as we continue to gain clinic penetration and market share and realize the benefit of our direct to consumer investments which we are maintaining in 2018.","Additional contributions to Companion Animal growth came from new product launches including our VANGUARD canine bivalent flu vaccine and DIROBAN for the treatment of heartworm. Partially offsetting growth in our Companion Animal business was the continued impact of expected competition on REVOLUTION, RIMADYL and CLAVAMOX.","Our U.S. Livestock business continued to grow in the first quarter, building off a strong fourth quarter with sales increasing 4%, thanks to the positive performance across all species. Colder and more volatile weather conditions across parts of the continental U.S. led to a greater risk of disease outbreak and incidence and this supported the sales of premium products.","Our beef cattle business also benefited from higher numbers of animals moving through feedlots than in the comparable period in 2017. The positive performance in beef was partially offset by dairy where reduction in herds due to lower dairy prices led to declines in sales of our anti-infectives and intramammaries.","In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives continues to be the primary driver of growth. Swine returned to growth in the first quarter. We are starting to see the benefits of our investments in our Fostera vaccine line including the launch of Fostera Gold PCV M. hyo and we expect further contribution in future quarters.","Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. I will cover a few key line items and then discuss guidance for 2018. Adjusted gross margin of 67.5% increased approximately 300 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis and reflects the benefit of continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network.","Operating expenses in total grew 6% operationally versus the same period last year. This reflects an increased investment in R&D in areas such as diagnostics and monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain. We also realized higher spend in SG&A, primarily due to increased compensation related costs.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.2%. The tax rate in the quarter is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of recently enacted U.S. tax reform and the benefit of certain discrete items such as the vesting of employee equity awards. We do, however, anticipate a higher effective tax rate for the remainder of the year in line with our guidance.","Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 34% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, cost improvements in manufacturing and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 36% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2017.","Now moving to guidance for full year 2018. The year is off to a solid start, as expected. We are therefore reaffirming our 2018 guidance provided during our February earnings call. Please note that this is shown representing foreign exchange rates as of mid-April.","For the year, we continue to expect to achieve operational revenue growth of 5% to 7% and operational growth in adjusted net income of 20% to 26%. In the fourth quarter, we will have comparisons to a strong U.S. Livestock performance and less calendar days due to a change in our accounting calendar.","Finally, we repurchased nearly $200 million of our shares in the first quarter and our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through Q1.","Just to summarize, before we go to Q&A. We're off to a good start with balanced growth across our portfolio including markets, therapeutic areas and species. We're seeing a balance contribution to growth across our in line portfolio, price and new products from our pipeline of novel innovation and lifecycle management. Our diversity, geographic presence and ability to innovate will continue to provide a platform for growth that is in line with or faster than the market. And we will continue to invest both internally and externally to support sound investments in our business and return excess capital to shareholders.","With that, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ram\u00f3n, can you talk a little bit about all the discussion about tariffs in recent months? Have you seen that impact your Livestock business at all? And maybe related to that, if we see changes in NAFTA, do you see any exposure to your U.S. Livestock business? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, John. We have not seen any impact on price in our Livestock business. Definitely, yeah, that is something that can have an impact on some of the U.S. producers. Same time, because of our international presence and because the consumption of animal proteins will remain the same, we expect that anything which is not produced in the U.S. because of the implementation of a tariff will be supplied by other markets where we also have activity. But maybe talking to two areas that represent the biggest concerns, one is China and the tariff on the importation of pork.","Our swine business in the U.S. represent 3% of our total revenue. 80% of the production in the U.S. is for local consumption and about 20% is for export. But in the case of exports, China only represent about 10% of these 20% of exports. So for our total revenues, this is something that would not have any impact. Definitely, we want to support our U.S. customers and I think it's something that we'll continue working to ensure that they manage any impact.","What percent of bigger impact is the NAFTA discussions. Definitely the export to Canada, the export to Mexico are significant and hopefully the U.S. government will achieve a good agreement with these two countries and they will continue supporting agriculture and livestock in the U.S. So next question, please.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Juan Ram\u00f3n and Glenn, could you give us a little bit more detail on your capital allocation priorities and capital structure? You increased the dividend 20%. You bought back more stock this quarter than you had in the past. I guess, how do you prioritize things and what's your outlook for strategic M&A? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. And our capital allocation priorities remain the same. So we'll continue investing internally. We have been showing that these investments are having a high return.","This year we are increasing our capital expenditure in manufacturing to ensure that we have the capacity and the capabilities that will be needed to support future growth. We'll continue investing in DTC to support key programs and we are expanding our field force to support diagnostic portfolio in the future.","We'll continue also assessing external opportunities at divisions. We'll remain focused on anything that will meet the criterias of a strategic asset, and also value creation, and it is something that we are regulating the cash really to contemplate this type of acquisition, but at the same time will remain very disciplined on ensuring that the return generated is through any type of external position. And we'll continue paying dividends and also buying share backs in line with what we have been communicated in previous discussions.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah, and the only thing I'll add, Kevin, as Juan Ram\u00f3n said, our priorities haven't changed. However, we continue to have additional capacity and flexibility to execute on those priorities.","And as we mentioned, our cash flow generation continues to increase also with tax reform. We have more flexibility and access to that cash and as you indicated in terms of your question around dividends versus share repurchase, we continue to prefer share repurchase as it does give us flexibility to execute on our other capital allocation priorities.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'll try to ask Kevin's question a little bit differently. Maybe in terms of the acceleration in your cash flow generation, could you just give us a little more color, metric behind how we should think about that? Maybe the magnitude of increase? And then also the earnings potential of that cash, that's not really reflected in your earnings per share as it is today. So how should we think about how that magnitude could improve over the next several years? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. So then, since you are asking a similar question, I will ask Glenn this time to answer to provide a different type of comments.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","In terms of the magnitude of the cash generation and how we expect that to increase particularly for 2018, I think as we look at that, while we don't provide specific guidance on cash generation, for 2018, you could pretty much expect it to increase at the pace of our adjusted net income.","So again we'll see continued expense in cash generation, continued flexibility to execute on our capital allocation priorities. Right? Our current guidance for 2018 includes the investments that we have internally. We've also referenced that we expect capital investments to be up in 2018 and then we'll continue to look for business development opportunities that have both the strategic and right financial rationale. To the extent that those materialize, we'll adjust our share repurchases either up or down depending on the magnitude of business development.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is actually (27:37) on for Erin today. Thanks for taking our question. We would like to ask a question about, how do you think about the quarterly progression of growth in product metrics and where do you think there are potential elements of conservatism in your guide relative to sort of the profit metrics? Thanks.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","So as we indicated, we don't provide necessarily quarterly guidance. A couple things though that we will point out related to the quarter, as we referenced on the call, a change in our accounting calendar. That does provide a slight benefit to growth in revenue, particularly in Q1 and Q3 to the tune of about a half point to a point of growth. That reverses in Q4 where we'll see negative impact to growth from a number of calendar days by about 1% to 2%. The other thing, just to point out from a growth perspective, obviously we face tough comparison in Q4, particularly based on the strength of the U.S. Livestock performance in Q4 2017.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. You talked about the competition in the U.S. on the in line products, the REVOLUTION, RIMADYL and then you also mentioned the strength in price for the portfolio overall. In the areas where you're seeing competition, is it more \u2013 specifically with those products, is it more in terms of volume? Or are you having a cut price there to sort of adjust for the market? And can you talk about what your expectations are for those products going forward, what levers you can pull to sort of strengthen that?","And then also, if actually I can squeeze one more in, on the diagnostics products, you mentioned it's been a few months since you launched that and you talked on it briefly in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about, give us an update on the build-out there with the sales force? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you for the questions, Mike. So we reported this quarter in Companion Animal U.S. 6% growth. When we say that we expect that, you say, growth in Companion Animal U.S. will be higher for the total year, we saw some impacts in the first quarter that Glenn will describe, but as I said many times, one of the advantages of Zoetis is the diversity of our portfolio and this diversity in terms of species, in terms of therapeutic areas, geographies. It's helping us to be consistent in terms of generating revenue growth. But maybe Glenn will talk about the impact or some of the problems in line portfolio in the U.S. volume, price and what are expectations that we have moving forward.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah, in terms of the impact of competition in the U.S., there were three products that especially faced the competition. It was CLAVAMOX, RIMADYL and REVOLUTION. CLAVAMOX, competition was really coming from generic sellers, primarily volume, but some price expense as well. And with CLAVAMOX, we have launched CLAVAMOX Chewables which we do expect will minimize this impact as we move forward. RIMADYL was really impacted by Galliprant and continued penetration of Galliprant and it's really a factor of the comparison year-over-year as the growth in the competition expanded throughout last year. So, we're in the toughest quarter in terms of comparison growth year-over-year. And then REVOLUTION, really Bravecto for cats was the biggest challenge from a competition perspective. And again, more volume competition there.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And maybe adding that also the parasiticide portfolio including REVOLUTION was affected by a cold March. This is something that we have seen also affecting the overall parasiticide portfolio not only for Zoetis, but also from our competitor.","So you also asked about diagnostics. Well, in diagnostics, we continue investing internally to develop our portfolio and we are making progress in this area. We already have products that we are offering to veterinarians, mainly Companion Animal, and what we started it's building our field support and the field support in (32:03) is field forces in all locations (32:06) that will be supporting our current and future portfolio. We started in the U.S. We are now also expanding in key international markets and we'll continue until we complete what we think will be the needs of field support for our diagnostic portfolio.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. I have two questions, please. First with respect to U.S. Companion Animal, the growth of 6% was marginally below what we had expected, but I wanted to ask about the outlook. I know that the comps may be getting a little bit tougher over the course of the year. I just don't have a sense for how to think about U.S. Companion Animal growth prospects in coming quarters.","And then second, you're obviously reinvesting in R&D, which has paid off in the past, and the R&D year-over-year growth is accelerating as you invest in, I guess, more expensive R&D projects and you're now past your cost efficiency initiatives in R&D. Could you just talk about the outlook for year-over-year spending growth in R&D as well? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Dave. And we expect higher growth for Companion Animal in the U.S. for the total year. And we expect that the higher growth will be coming from, well, the strong season on parasiticides that is now starting. Also the investment in DTC that has started in the month of April, so no impact in the first quarter. We'll be increasing our campaigns for DTC for increasing awareness on dermatology conditions and also we'll be also investing in DTC for Simparica. So all this should generate expansion of the market in dermatology and also continue grow in terms of a market share for Simparica. So we are optimistic about generating a higher growth in Companion Animal in the U.S. for a total 2018.","In terms of the R&D investment, we are increasing our allocation for R&D. We have a strategic program that we are supporting. We also added some additional products with the acquisition of Nexvet that now we are supporting. We are also increasing our allocation for diagnostic R&D as well as increasing also investment in fish. So all this it's really increasing the level of allocation that we are \u2013 we are reallocating (35:05) that to R&D, and we are very confident that we'll maintain the same level of total activity that we show in the past. Glenn, if you want to add some additional comments either on the U.S. or R&D, please...","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. Just to add to the U. S. Companion Animal growth comment. Just one thing to consider particularly for the quarter, the quarter was negatively impacted by Simparica growth in the quarter and that was really driven by a tough comparator to Q1 of 2017. So if you go back to 2017, we had strong sales in Q1 and then a sharp decline in sales in Q2. We're not going to see that same pattern in 2018. So while Simparica was a decliner in growth in Q1, we expect that to drive growth in Q2 to Q4 as well, which will then help accelerate growth in Companion Animal throughout the year.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I'm sorry if I missed this, Glenn, but could you give us the U.S. rest of world breakdown for APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT, and my more strategic question is about the fish business. Obviously a nice grower but small numbers overall. I'm curious conceptually how large can that business become for you relative to the other categories and species over the very long term? And clearly there's an organic story with R&D spend that, is this an area ripe for acquisitions as well? Again just looking at how large could this business be relative to others longer term. Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Gregg. Glenn you want to provide the details of the derm portfolio?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the derm portfolio, so for the quarter, we had $122 million in sales and derm growing nicely, over 50% growth. Of that, $83 million was U.S., $39 million was international. The break out of $122 million between APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, there was $99 million in APOQUEL, $22 million in CYTOPOINT and obviously there's just a little bit rounding in the numbers between the two.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And I will provide some comments about fish. It is difficult to estimate what will be the long-term opportunities for fish. Today most of the revenues generated in fish are coming from salmon, and in our case we are focused on salmon. We have 70% market share in salmon for vaccines.","But the growth that will be generated in the future will be also for expanding the portfolio of vaccines for other fish species, mainly fresh fish, in where today the mortality rates are very high and most of the products that are used are antibiotics which are dropped into the water.","So we expect that in the same way that many years ago the salmon industry moved from antibiotics to vaccines and today we are not using almost antibiotics in the production of fish. We expect the same for other species in the future.","We see fish in some way similar to protein many years ago. In where there was very small revenue generated in poultry and now poultry, well, it's $16 billion revenues. So in the total animal health \u2013 no sorry \u2013 $5 billion. $6 billion (38:50), $5 billion total revenues for poultry. So we expect that maybe not reaching this level of revenues for fish, but over time moving from an industry that today is about $600 million, $700 million to an industry that will generate more than $1 billion in terms of revenue, and we think that the greatest asset, already the expertise and also the infrastructure to generate the future products that will be delivered to the fish producers. So next question, please?","Operator","And we'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jonathan David Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I'm actually going to try to squeeze two or three into one. And just to roll through, maybe first, last quarter you had conviction that dairy would pick up in the back half of 2018. Just curious if that's still intact as pricing seemingly remains difficult. I guess part B would be fish up modestly year-over-year, but a big step down from the run rate that we did see in the back half of 2017. So how do we think about the contribution from PHARMAQ this year?","And then lastly, sorry, but just Simparica, is there an update in the goal? And by that I mean out of the gate I think you guys pointed to a $100 million annual product. We've seen APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT have the positive revisions. What's the latest on Simparica? Is there a sort of an update positive or negative to the initial $100 million? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jon. Let me start with the question on dairy and look for 2018. In general, Livestock, it's stable in terms of the previous conversations that we had in February. Maybe realistic (40:37) exception, it's dairy, in where we have seen that prices have been declining and we expect that in 2018 dairy farmers will face the challenge of profitability because of these prices.","We expect that as in many other occasions there are cycles that always are happening and the next cycle they will be adjusting the volume and the supply and then prices will recover and we expect that in 2019, so the dairy industry will be back to profits. But even if the dairy, it's more negative, we'll see in some cases more positive in other species in Livestock that will compensate. So we remain confident that the total livestock will be in line with the projections that we made at the beginning of the year.","In terms of fish, this quarter the fish portfolio was flat. We are comparing with a quarter in where our vaccine for SRS in Chile was priced at much higher level. We adjusted the prices in following process and we are comparing something which is probably in terms of our volume. We have continue increasing the penetration. Price is having a negative impact in the total revenue growth, but we expect that the growth for our fish will be growing in line of what's on the market but will be faster than the overall growth for animal health. And maybe Glenn, you want to talk about Simparica?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. The only other thing I'll mention on fish in terms of sequential quarters versus Q4 is the PD season, as we've indicated, really is in the second half of the year. So that's part of the step down between Q4 and Q1 performance as well. In terms of Simparica, we have indicated that we expect that product to be a blockbuster with sales of greater than $100 million and that still is our expectation for Simparica.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just two questions here. First on the incremental investments you're making in R&D, how much of that is focused on lifecycle management versus breakthrough investments? And when we think about areas that you're focused on on the breakthrough side, what are you most excited about as you think about the R&D portfolio?","My second question was just a quick one on tax. You obviously had a lower rate in the quarter. I know you expect that to rebound the rest of the year. But we have seen a number of companies lower their tax expectations as they've had more time to digest the new rules. So as you think about Zoetis beyond 2018, could we see improvement to the tax rate as the business trends over time? Or is 21%, 22% rate a good one to think about going forward? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Chris. And we are investing in lifecycle or new product innovation about the same. So we are very much balance how much these investments in our current portfolio compare to the products that will be new into the market and creating some additional growth. And in terms of what are we most excited about R&D. Definitely, we are very excited about monoclonal antibody. We have now one monoclonal antibody which is working extremely well and generating a very positive growth and missing the demand of our customers which is CYTOPOINT which is complementing APOQUEL. But we see monoclonal antibody as platform for many other indications including pain for dogs and cats and we see that, especially for cats, it's a significant unmet need. There's nothing specific for cats today. We state that monoclonal antibodies will cover this need and will generate very positive feedback from the market.","We are also excited and will continue investing in sarolaner which is the molecule of Simparica and combining this with other active ingredients to extend the protection of dogs and cats to other parasiticides including internal and external. And we continue also excited about finding ways of integrating more the different aspects of healthcare, not just vaccination or treatment but also prediction with the genetic market, genetic information, and also detection with our diagnostic investment to build our portfolio also to cover from prediction, detection, prevention and treatment. And all across that ensuring that we use digital data analytics to really increase the value of our R&D investment.","So definitely we are working on all these aspects and we think that they are great opportunities in both the Companion Animal and Livestock. And we see that integrating all these elements of healthcare will also have an impact on R&D but also an impact in our value that we'll be delivering to our customers. And let me ask Glenn to talk about tax rate for 2018 and 2019.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of the tax rate, the guidance that we had provided in February, we had spent a lot of time trying to understand the new law and providing that guidance. And we really haven't learned anything new to date that changes our expectations for the approximate 21% to 22% that we have for 2018.","Over time, we'll continue to look for ways to grind down the rate but we don't see it changing substantially from the 21% to 22%.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Glenn. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just trying to \u2013 going back to the U.S. Companion Animal business that was up 6%, can you tell us, Glenn, what is a normalized growth rate if you exclude APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT? Those have been such strong drivers of growth to that business and I know there were a lot of moving pieces with Simparica this quarter. But is that business growing excluding APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT?","And then secondly, what sort of competitive intelligence have you guys done around future competition, specifically for APOQUEL? Elanco certainly has the JAK inhibitor technology. What have you seen out there, and when do you expect competition to materialize for either of those two products? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Jami and I will answer first about the competition that we may expect for APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT and then Glenn will talk about the U.S. growth and also in line and also the rest of the portfolio. So as you know there is very little information about R&D in our industry. Most of our competitors are part of big pharma companies and they don't have the need of disclosing the details about R&D like in human health to support the future growth. It's something that is much more complicated.","We should expect that in the future we'll have competition for APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT. There are some indications that the company was offering the monoclonal antibody that maybe have some activity in allergy, but it is information that they provided. They're still far from reaching the market because it was very early stage of development so it will take several years to reach and market.","Apart from that, maybe some competitors are also working on developing this type of portfolio. We are very confident that first we have very strong asset protection for APOQUEL, that that will go through 2029 and for CYTOPOINT it will be even longer. And we have two products that has been demonstrated efficacy and also safety and that has been extremely well accepted by the market. So definitely competition one day will come but we're still very confident that we have very strong portfolio and very strong way to support our portfolio.","And Glenn will talk about the U.S. Companion Animal growth and the breakdown between key problems and in line portfolio.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","For U.S. Companion Animal growth, when you back out the impact of derm, you especially get to flat growth for the rest of the portfolio. And that was driven by a number of factors. A, we talked about the competition that we experienced on the three products that we described. We also had the negative impact of some of the quarterly variation with Simparica that we do expect to reverse as we move throughout the year.","Offsetting that was growth in some other new product as well that contributed nicely and growth from some other in line portfolio as well. So overall, we were flat when you take out the impact of dermatology.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the taking questions. Just curious when you think about the Companion business, if you could provide some perspective on just sort of the consolidation we've seen on the customer side in terms of the vet clinics. And does that have any impact positive or negative in terms of your business there, in the Companion business in the U.S.?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, the consolidation on vet clinics, it's something that is happening and we expect that that will continue in the future. We have now Banfield and VCA, they're consolidating and representing, it's about 2,000 clinics in total. And it's a significant customer. We have excellent relationship with both VCA and also with Banfield.","There are other group that are now consolidating and we'll see that many individual clinics will be also forming and buying groups or other sorts of networks. This definitely will have pressure in terms of pricing. But at the same time, we are very confident that the portfolio that we have which includes products which are highly differentiated also will help us to manage this situation or to manage volume and price discussions. And this is also something that we are incorporating in our projections. It's something that will happen in the U.S. We'll see also some type of buying groups in countries like the UK or France. It's part of what we should be expect in the future, but at the same time, with this consolidation, it's also increasing the opportunity to integrate more many of the things that we can offer to these clinics.","So next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for taking the questions. Can we get your Simparica sales by U.S. and ex U.S. please? You provided some helpful comments about the U.S. performance. Would appreciate your thoughts about expectations for ex U.S.","And then Glenn, stepping back and looking at your margins, you've obviously made great progress. Just wondering what kind of operating margin is possible for your business in an optimal scenario. I appreciate the earlier comments about gross margin getting better with mix and efficiency but as competition increases invariably in dermatology, as you recently just pointed out, I would imagine that you also need to \u2013 there's going to be some need for SG&A spend. So if you were to look at your business optimally on an operating margin, help us figure out how much more room you have left there. Thank you very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","I will start with a comment on Simparica. Glenn will provide more detail. But we have seen that the interaction of Simparica in international markets continue growing and continue growing there very nicely. And we see that the opportunities of growth in international markets are in line or even higher than our expectation and we are both very confident that Simparica will reach a significant part of the revenues in the future in international markets. But maybe, Glenn, you can go into more detail.","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. Just to add to that point, so Simparica internationally grew 100%, over 100% in the quarter, so very strong growth internationally. To break out, there was $31 million in sales for Simparica for the quarter; $18 million of that was in the U.S., $13 million was international.","In terms of operating margin, so as we've said in the past, we're not focused purely on generating higher operating margins. We're (55:30) both driving profitable revenue growth and improving on our overall cash flow. And that's going to continue to be our focus moving forward.","That being said, we believe our long term value proposition is very much in place in terms of our ability to grow revenue at a faster pace than OpEx and therefore drive adjusted net income growth at a faster pace than revenue.","You reference in terms of competition and global scale, we believe in the majority of the markets that we operate, we currently have the scale and infrastructure to support the anticipated revenue growth that we have moving forward. To the extent that there are some changes needed, they'll probably be more in the incremental house (56:05) to support additional revenue growth and would not change our cost structure materially.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. First on canine pain. Given that we've seen Galliprant making some inroads, does Zoetis have an interest in small molecule canine pain meds or is your focus on monoclonals? And can you give us any update on the timing of the next monoclonals that you have in development?","And the second question is on antibiotic-free proteins. Do you see the demand for antibiotic free proteins in the U.S. increasing or do you think it's stabilized? And what are the types of products or services that Zoetis is providing to offset some of the loss of the antibiotic sales? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you for the questions, Kathy, and let me start saying that, well, we are focused on for pain for dogs mostly on monoclonal antibodies. We think that the current treatment that exists in the market related to NSAIDs or other type of solutions are well covered, but we see the opportunity of bringing monoclonal antibodies that will provide excellent efficacy to treat the symptoms of pain and also excellent safety profile.","We have seen that, well, Galliprant had a good increase in 2017. Maybe they are reaching some level of plateau in terms of growth. And we are convinced that the portfolio we have today with RIMADYL, RIMADYL, it's a product that has been in the market for many years. It's extremely well accepted there based on brand equity, and we'll continue supporting RIMADYL in terms of oral formulations and developing these injectable formulation with monoclonal antibodies.","In terms of demand for non-antibiotic or antibiotic-free proteins, we have seen that in poultry. It has been increasing there, the production of antibiotic-free, and the advantage of (58:39) is that we can also offer alternative to antibiotics and protein have been growing very nicely with this alternative and we have not seen the negative impact of the reduction of antibiotics in poultry.","In other species, it's much more complicated to move to antibiotic-free production because they're much more exposed to external pathogens and with this exposure, so the infections are much more complicated to achieve with biosecurity and other healthcare protocols.","In any case, we'll continue working internally to identify alternative to antibiotics that will protect the animals. One of these alternatives is where we are investing and will continue investing is vaccination. But we know that despite of all healthcare protocols and vaccinations there, animals get sick and when they get sick, they need to use antibiotics. Otherwise the impact in animals, in the productivity, but also the potential impact to humans will be extremely negative. So we'll work on alternative, but I don't \u2013 we don't see that antibiotics can be replaced in some of the species like beef or even pork. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick follow-up question on the pipeline. Thank you for some of the color you provided. Can you call out any specific pipeline catalysts over the next couple of years, let's say? Just want to get a sense of when some of the opportunities that you've talked about qualitatively can come to fruition and translate into revenues. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","More than providing specific timing for the launch of the product, but in some cases, as you know, first, we don't want to provide information to our competitor. That will be a negative to us, and we want to make sure that when we launch a product that we maximize revenues and profits as fast as we can. And providing details probably will reduce the opportunity to maximize our new product launches.","But definitely we'll see that we'll be launching in the next coming years combination of sarolaner with other active ingredients to cover internal and external parasiticides, as I mentioned. You will see that we are introducing also monoclonal antibodies for pain in dogs and cats. We'll continue bringing new innovation in terms of vaccines. In 2018 we introduce an expansion of our Fostera line with the first vaccination for PCV2, combining 2a and 2b, and also providing cross protection against 2d.","So we are very pleased with the way that we are investing in our portfolio. And there will be many other things that we'll continue discussing in the future. But we prefer at this point not to provide too many details of specific programs or time, because I said this is something that we are \u2013 we want to protect our future launches and not to provide too much information to our competitors. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Westenberg with C.L. King. Please go ahead.","David Westenberg - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you for squeezing me in. So the merger or the upcoming merger of Henry Schein and Vets First Choice, a lot of that's on the paradigm they believe they can increase compliance. Now, for Zoetis, what opportunity do you see in encouraged compliance in your own kind of products? Is there a real potential to kind of grow the market in the companion animal market? And as a follow-up to that and the merger, what are the opportunities that you see to work with a Henry Schein, Vets First Choice combined company?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, we have excellent collaboration with both and we expect that this collaboration will be maintained in the future with the combination of Henry Schein and Vets First Choice. We see also that this JV will increase compliance, mainly on the chronic treatment and this an area that we will have a benefit for pet owners, a benefit for veterinarians and also benefits for manufacturers. We think that this type of JV also will increase the support to veterinarians and it's an area that we are 100% aligned in terms of keeping veterinarians at the center of any healthcare decision. And we think that this type of JV will expand also the presence in international markets. Vets First Choice is mainly focused on the U.S. today, but with their JV they maybe expand to other markets and definitely we expect to have a good collaboration with them.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum.

Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Just one quick small one to squeeze in. I know it's not core business but the contract manufacturing slipped a decent amount in the quarter and by our estimates was a 25 bps to 50 bps headwind to the top line. Can you talk about that business? It's a little lumpy but is this something that you expect to continue going forward or was this just in timing of orders?","Glenn David - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. That one really is just timing of orders. That business, it varies by quarter so I wouldn't read anything into the first quarter performance.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","And this a business which is, as you said, is not core. It's helping us to increase the volume in some of our facilities and the absorption of overhead. But definitely is not an area that we are promoting or we are trying to increase the business through these third-party contact with in manufacturing.

And good morning, everyone. Today I will discuss our performance for the third quarter and make comments about the acquisition of PHARMAQ, which we announced last night. Paul will then update you on our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017. All of the growth rates I'm discussing today are operational, excluding the impact of foreign exchange currency.","I am very pleased to report that this quarter we continued to deliver strong revenue and adjusted net income growth based on our diverse portfolio of high-quality products, excellence in execution and our continued discipline on cost and expenses. Despite some global economic challenges, the animal health industry remains resilient based on the strong fundamental drivers for improved protein production and healthier pets. Our growth strategies and resources are aligned against these drivers to expand our market leadership in the industry. The acquisition of PHARMAQ, a market-leading company in aquatic health, is an example of this growth strategy and will bring us another platform to strengthen our Livestock business. This quarter's growth was largely due to the performance of our Livestock business in the U.S., the integration of Abbott Animal Health products into our business and the growth of recent product launches, led by APOQUEL.","During the third quarter, we generated operational growth of 9% revenue and 31% in adjusted net income, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $0.50 per share. And thanks to our efficiency improvement, reported adjusted net income grew 22% despite a negative impact of foreign currency, which resulted in flat revenue growth.","As we break down our third quarter revenue via species, Companion Animal grew 18% due to the additional sales from Abbott Animal Health and the continued performance of key brands, such as APOQUEL in the dermatology space, REVOLUTION in parasiticides, as well as CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA. I'm very positive about the progress we have made on the integration of Abbott Animal Health and we expect to exceed the targets we set from this acquisition in terms of revenues and cost synergies.","In Livestock we grew 5%, driven by strong growth in cattle, which was tempered by relatively flat sales in swine and poultry. Cattle grew 8%. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions in the U.S. and Brazil with our key brands and some recent product launches. This growth was partially offset by the impact of our business reduction in Venezuela and lower sales in France. As you may recall, we had increased customers' orders in France last year that came ahead of the introduction of a new anti-infective legislation.","Swine products grew 1%. We delivered exceptional growth in China as a result of our strong portfolio and improving market conditions, which was offset by lower sales in Europe and Venezuela. Poultry sales were flat based on the growth in Latin America, including Brazil, which was offset by lower sales in other emerging markets and the U.S. The diversity of our portfolio across species, geographies and therapeutic areas continues to help us maximize opportunities in animal health, while mitigating the risk that can arise in certain markets.","Now let me talk for a minute about our business in two markets whose economies has been getting a lot of attention and where we continue to produce strong results despite overall economic volatility. In Brazil, the animal health industry is very resilient and not being impacted by the current economic decline there. Consumers are reducing their spending in other areas, while maintaining their consumption of animal proteins.","In some cases, we may see them switching from more expensive to less expensive meat, but since we are well-positioned in other species, we have been able to sustain a strong Livestock business. We are also at a very positive point in the cattle cycle in Brazil, with tight supplies of animal and high prices for meat. This place a premium on animal health and creates incentives for our customers to build their herds.","In China, we are also seeing exceptional revenue growth for our business, despite some recent reports of a slowdown in their economy. Demand for proteins, especially pork, has shown stronger growth. And we are seeing higher prices for meat in the market. The long-term trend of smaller farms consolidating into larger operations will also add to our growth, as the swine population becomes increasingly medicalized and production become more efficient.","While the economic challenge in China may impact other sectors, it wouldn't have a significant impact on the animal health industry and China continues to focus on improving the quality and stability of its food chain.","Through the first nine months of the year, we have continued to deliver on our value proposition by growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.","Our operational growth in revenue and adjusted net income were 9% and 22% year-to-date. And despite the impact of foreign currency, we have delivered 1 and 15% growth. As I have said many times, our industry-leading sales force, high-quality manufacturing and focus on new product innovation and enhancement remain key elements of our competitive advantage.","Now let me turn to some other updates. Last night we announced our agreement to purchase PHARMAQ, the global leader in vaccines and innovation for aquatic health. The acquisition is a great strategic fit that brings to Zoetis an animal health leader with similar competitive advantage, an industry-leading portfolio, strong customer relationships and world-class innovation and manufacturing. PHARMAQ strengthens our Livestock business by providing a market-leading portfolio and a strong late-stage pipeline. Fish is the world's largest category of animal protein and they are leaders in the fast-growing animal health market, farm fish.","The acquisition strengthens our core business in three key ways. PHARMAQ expands our customer base into the farm fish segment, it adds to our diverse portfolio a leading vaccine for farm fish and innovative parasiticide as well. PHARMAQ is the market leader in vaccine for farm fish, a market growing 10% annually. And finally, it expands our R&D program in aquatic health, with a strong late-stage pipeline expected to deliver new solutions to the market in the near-term. Zoetis has an excellent track record of identifying and integrating their businesses, and this one meets all our criteria in terms of strategic fit and value.","With this acquisition expected to close on or about November 10, I'm very excited to welcome the PHARMAQ team to Zoetis. Our companies share a passion for supporting customers and keeping animals healthy and productive, and that gives us a strong foundation to build on.","We also continue to see steady progress in the new product innovation and lifecycle developments coming from our internal R&D team. In September, we received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for initial marketing authorization of SIMPARICA, a once-monthly chewable medication for the treatment of fleas, ticks and mange mite infestations in dogs beginning at eight weeks of age. We await for the news in Europe and the U.S. on potential approvals of SIMPARICA. I will keep you informed of future developments.","In another step to maintain our global R&D leadership and to grow in critical emerging markets, just last week we strengthened our commitment to China. We announced the opening of a new research and development center near Beijing and the opening of a new global manufacturing facility near Suzhou, which replace our original plant that has been there since 1995. These investments are a strong foundation for future growth in China and the broader Asian market.","Now, let me turn to another topic that I mentioned last quarter, ERP implementation and APOQUEL supply. The vast majority of the ERP implementation issues in the U.S. are being resolved and customers should be seeing the level of service improving. In the third quarter, we had continued with successful implementation in another 27 markets, which cover Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, and we remain on track to complete the global ERP program by the end of Q1 2016.","As for APOQUEL, we have been able to resolve manufacturing issues related to our active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API. We are also in the process of bringing on a second source for API supply in the near future. We continue ramping up production of finished goods in the fourth quarter of 2015. Although we now expect slightly lower sales of $125 million in full year 2015 than previously anticipated, we expect to be in a stronger supply position as we head into 2016.","With the strong demand we have seen, even though we have not yet fully launched this product to our customers, we are increasing our view of peak sales for the product to more than $300 million. We look forward broadening customer access to APOQUEL in markets like the U.S. and launching in additional markets around the world in 2016.","In summary, we delivered excellent third quarter operational results with diverse sources of revenue growth across our portfolio. We continue to implement changes to reduce complexity and cost in our business and to strengthen our ability to execute on the market opportunities before us and we remain well positioned for profitable growth based on our core capabilities, our diverse portfolio and continuing investment in the areas that matter for our customers: high quality customer service, relevant innovation and reliable supply.","I will now ask Paul to provide some comments on the quarter. Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. The financial highlights of the quarter are, once again, strong operational revenue growth of 9% coming from a variety of sources and cost discipline that together were the major factors in driving significant operational growth in adjusted net income, as Juan Ram\u00f3n said, up 31% from Q3 of 2014.","Now, I'll sound like a broken record, but I want to emphasize that we manage our business for the long-term and, when we measure how we're doing, we look at years, not quarters. A lot of noise can creep into any one quarter in isolation. For example, we have seasonal elements to our business that impact our customers' buying patterns and those patterns are not necessarily consistent year-to-year. The high productivity that we enjoy from our R&D engine sees revenue growth, but not necessarily in a linear fashion.","My point is that 9% operational growth of revenue and 31% operational growth in adjusted net income for Q3 as compared with Q3 of 2014 is good, but the year-to-date operational revenue growth of 9% and the adjusted net income growth of 22% and our revised guidance for the full years 2015, 2016 and 2017 are better indicators of our performance and prospects. And they look pretty good, right?","While we believe that the best way to evaluate our performance is on an operational basis, our guidance and your financial models are focused on expectations for our reported results. I bring this up because we've been able to maintain and now improve our 2015 guidance for adjusted net income per share in the face of unrelenting FX headwinds. And we're proud of that.","Before I provide some comments around our guidance, let me call your attention to a few items of note in our quarterly results. Once again, our Q3 and year-to-date results reflect the multiple ways that we can and do deliver revenue growth. Of the 9% operational growth in revenue in the quarter, 3% came from the acquisition out of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% was driven by increased sales of APOQUEL, 3% came from the impact of increased selling prices and about 1% came from other new product introductions.","We had unit growth in our other in line products other than APOQUEL of about 1%, but that growth was offset by reduced sales in Venezuela. Now, there's a real balance in how we generate revenue growth and continuing evidence that we can tap all of these sources to drive growth at or faster than the projected mid-single digit growth rates of the markets in which we compete.","A few highlights. U.S. business was very strong, posting 19% growth in Q3 over Q3 of 2014. The Companion Animal business was up 27% and Livestock was up 13%. Within Companion Animal, the big drivers were the addition of the acquired Abbott Animal Health products, increased sales of APOQUEL as we continued to ramp up the supply of the product and strength across other key brands, including REVOLUTION, CERENIA, PROHEART and CONVENIA.","In Livestock, strong sales of cattle products, for example, DRAXXIN and CEFTIOFUR led the way, while we had more modest gains in swine and a slight decline in poultry. Buying patterns, particularly in the Livestock segment, can fluctuate due to weather patterns and herd movements. Q3 of 2015 saw seasonal demand for Livestock products pick up earlier in the year than we observed in 2014. The outlook for the second half of 2015 remains solid, but with revenue skewed more towards Q3 than we saw in 2014.","Turning to the International segment, which grew 2% operationally for the quarter, let me highlight five countries; three that contributed to growth, Japan, China and Brazil, and two countries, France and Venezuela, where we saw declines compared with the year-ago quarter. First, Japan. The significant increase in Japan, up 56%, is mainly due to the comparison with a weak Q3 of 2014 when we bought back inventory in connection with the termination of a distributor agreement in Japan.","Revenue in China increased 24% operationally, as higher pork prices created favorable conditions for pork producers and supported strong demand for our vaccine products. Revenue in Brazil was up 12% operationally, fueled by price growth, new product launches and successful promotional efforts by our Brazilian colleagues in what is, despite the broader economic climate, a favorable environment for cattle producers.","Growth in Japan, China, Brazil and other markets were offset mainly by declines in France, which was down 27% operationally, and Venezuela. In France, Q3 2014 revenues were substantially higher than normal as customers bought products ahead of changes to France's regulation of anti-infective sales. In Venezuela, as we reported back in May, we are reducing our efforts in the country in light of the uncertain economic situation there.","Before I move on, I want to put an exclamation point on Juan Ram\u00f3n's comments around Brazil and China. There's been a lot of talk recently about the challenging economic environments in Brazil and China and the impact of those economies on global companies, like ours. I won't repeat everything Juan Ram\u00f3n said, but I do want to add a finance guy's perspective.","The challenges in Brazil and China are real, but just how challenging they are depends on the segments in which you compete and other fundamental factors. Our business and our company tend to be less impacted by general economic conditions and Zoetis' prospects in China, Brazil and related markets remain good. Our operational growth in China of 24% in Q3 was actually faster than was posted for the first half of the year. And in Brazil, our operational growth in the quarter of 12% was the same as our operational growth through the first half of the year.","I bring this up because there will continue to be hand-wringing about the impact of these economies on global businesses, and appropriately so. However, our belief is our industry and our company are far less exposed to weakness in these economies than other companies and industries, and our historical results and our results so far in 2014 support that belief.","Quick update on our operational efficiency initiative. We're making excellent progress implementing the structural and organizational changes that will drive the cost reductions we outlined to you in May. We remain on track to deliver our target of at least $300 million of cost reductions entering calendar 2017. I want to repeat that we have been and continue to be thoughtful in how we achieve those cost savings with a focus on efficiency and the preservation of the core strengths of our business model: our direct sales forces, our productive R&D engine and our supply chain.","In terms of one-time costs, you'll recall that I talk about these costs in three buckets: our standup and other one-time costs, the costs associated to our efficiency initiative and the costs associated with our supply network strategy. In the quarter, we incurred $28 million of stand-up and other one-time costs. The stand-up costs associated with our separation from Pfizer are largely behind us and should be complete in 2016.","We recorded $21 million of one-time costs associated with the efficiency initiative in the quarter. Much of the cost of the initiative were recorded in Q2 of 2015. And finally, we recorded $3 million of costs associated with the supply network strategy. We continue to be in the early days of this initiative. We have provided a slide summarizing our current estimates of the total cash cost associated with each bucket.","Now here's the payoff pitch. Updates to our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017, the good news here is that there is a lot of good news. Let's start with 2015. We narrowed and revised our guidance range for revenue. Let's not lose sight of the negative impact of FX rates that reduced the range by some $25 million since our last update. We reduced the top end of the range by $25 million, but held the low end of the range.","Next, we have reduced the expectation for adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue by some 50 basis points to 100 basis points to now being approximately 35%. Of this improvement, some comes from the favorable impact of FX rates, so those benefits may be judicious, (24:44) but some of the improvement is structural in that it represents improvements in the management of the supply chain.","For SG&A, we narrowed the range towards the upper boundary. For R&D, we decreased the range by $30 million to a range of $350 million to $370 million, reflecting a more rapid realization of some of the savings from the efficiency initiative. I want to point out that even though we are spending less in R&D, we continue to commit the necessary resources to support our rationalized product portfolio and to develop new innovative products to fuel our long-term growth.","Finally, we revised our guidance for our tax rate on adjusted income down by about 100 basis points to approximately 28%. Part of this favorability is structural, coming from refinements and simplification of our operating model as well as several discrete items that occurred during the quarter. All of these things together enable us to raise and narrow our range for full year 2015 adjusted net income per share to $1.70 to $1.74, with the entire range of our revised guidance above the high end of our previous guidance. As I said, good news.","Looking out to 2016. The negative impact of FX rates would have lowered our prior revenue guidance by some $105 million. However, a combination of factors has enabled us to increase 2016 revenue guidance by $75 million to $100 million. Supporting the increase are the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the addition of new products, including IL-31 and SIMPARICA. The new revenue guidance range for 2016 implies operational growth versus 2015 in the range of 3% to 5%.","As a reminder, this growth rate is suppressed by the impact of the ongoing SKU rationalization and our decision to reduce our activities in Venezuela. The increase to the range of SG&A costs is a result of several factors, including cost that's moved as a function of our now higher revenue outlook, second is the inclusion of SG&A cost for PHARMAQ and finally cost to support the launches of IL-31 and SIMPARICA. I want to point out, launch costs for Animal Health Products tend to be more modest and of shorter duration as compared with launch costs in human health.","We reduced our outlook for R&D costs consistent with my comments around 2015, but then we added in costs associated with Aquatic Health R&D, which is embedded in PHARMAQ. The other significant change is the reduced expected tax rate on adjusted income from 30% to 28%, this reflects some structural benefits coming from actions to further refine and simplify our global operating model, which are expected to continue into future years. The net result of all the changes we are making to our outlook for 2016 is that we are revising upward our guidance for 2016 adjusted net income to the range of $925 million to $975 million, with implied operational growth moving from 12% to 19% to the range of 14% to 20%. The range for 2016 adjusted EPS moves up to $1.84 to $1.94. And especially in light of the FX headwinds, this is good stuff.","Finally, and I'll spend less time on it, 2017 guidance. In a nutshell, the negative impact of changed FX rates on the previously provided revenue range is a reduction of about $115 million. But we are increasing 2017 revenue guidance by $175 million. The increase is driven by the acquisition of PHARMAQ, increased expectations for the acquired Abbott products and APOQUEL and the inclusion of the new products, IL-31 and SIMPARICA. Where previously we had guided to operational revenue growth in 2017 versus 2016 in the range of 3% to 7%, we are now guiding to the range of 4% to 9%. And this is truly organic growth as the acquisitions for both the Abbott products and PHARMAQ are fully reflected in our 2016 guidance.","I call your attention to the tables that contain all the details of our guidance in 2017 and the changes from prior guidance and I'll just skip to the end. We're increasing our guidance for 2017 adjusted net income by $30 million to the range of $1.125 billion to $1.195 billion, implying growth on an operational basis in 2017 versus 2016 of 18% to 26%. And our guidance for adjusted EPS has been increased by $0.06 per share to the range of $2.24 to $2.38 per share. Again, strong and reflective of the team here taking all steps to drive profitable growth.","Please note that for 2016 and 2017 we've assumed a constant diluted share count of approximately 502 million shares, as we expect our share repurchase program to at least offset the dilutive impact of our share-based comp plans. Speaking of our share repurchase program, in the third quarter we purchased 1.1 million shares for about $50 million, an average price of $46.92 per share. Through the third quarter and year-to-date in 2015, we repurchased 3.2 million shares for an aggregate $148.1 million, an average price of $46.45 per share.","Before we move to Q&A, I want to take the opportunity to talk about the strength of our industry and our company in turbulent times. I have to say we've been a little frustrated watching our share price drift lower while at the same time knowing that we are delivering across a range of activities that we believe are building the value of our company.","We ended 2014 with a share price of roughly $43, not a lot different from our closing price last night. But here's a short list of the things that we've accomplished since the beginning of the year. In January, we closed the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health business. In February, we put a strong full-year 2014 on the board, delivering operational revenue growth of 7%, adjusted net income growth of 13%.","In May, we unveiled our operational efficiency program and provided you with a road map in the form of longer-term guidance as to how we intend to increase profit levels and improve our adjusted operating margin to the mid 30%s. And we reported a strong Q1 of 2015 with operational revenue growth of 6% and adjusted net income growth of 14%. In August, we put a strong Q2 on the board, year-to-date operational revenue growth of 8% and adjusted net income growth of 17% and we announced that we received a conditional license on the innovative monoclonal antibody for Canine Atopic Dermatitis, which you call IL-31.","Today we post a strong Q3 of 2015, with year-to-date operational growth of revenue of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 22%. And we announced the acquisition of PHARMAQ, providing us with a market-leading presence in aquatic health, the fastest-growing segment of the animal health industry. That's a heck of a year and we're only through Q3. Our industry has continued to prove its many positive attributes. And coming up on three years since our IPO, we believe the team here has proven the strength of Zoetis' business model and our capability to deliver to you value.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and so let's open the line for questions. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll take our first question from Erin Wilson with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Erin E. Wilson - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. How would you characterize the underlying demand trends across the U.S. livestock market? How should we think about the quarterly progression here given the buying patterns you alluded to in the press release? And if you could comment on poultry dynamics as well.","And then part two of my question would be, as far as the acquisition goes, can you speak to underlying profitability of the business and potential synergies and cost savings associated with the PHARMAQ deal and your capacity for future business development initiatives? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Erin. And let me answer the first question on the demand in the U.S. Definitely, there are different drivers depending on the different types of animal proteins, cattle, pork, swine. I would say that the cattle, it's still facing maybe some limited production, although the demand has been reduced slightly. Because of the limited production, it seems most of the producers are rebuilding their herd and sending less animals to the slaughterhouses. At the same time, in some markets we have seen that the demand for beef has been changing slightly, but we remain very positive in terms of the cattle business in the U.S.","In terms of poultry, the demand continues very strong. And I think we expect also that not a significant impact in terms of the avian flu affecting the meat part of the poultry segment, although this is affecting the egg production.","And in swine, in 2015 we have seen a significant increase in the supply because of the PDV is not affecting and the farmer have been able to increase significantly the number of animals. And this also has been making a pressure in terms of prices. But for the animal health industry, it has been positive because there are more animals and more animals to be treated and protected.","In terms of PHARMAQ, I think really Paul can provide the details on this acquisition.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. And I think your question, Erin, was around how do you think about this business in the go-forward? And firstly I want to point out a couple of things. Is this is a business that shares a lot of the characteristics of our business. These are long-duration assets participating in solid growth markets that are supported by a productive R&D engine. It's very similar to our business.","There are cost synergies associated with our acquisition here, however, this is not a cost synergy deal. PHARMAQ have solid operations on the sales and marketing side, as well as in the R&D side and of course in the manufacturing arena. And so from a cost perspective, this is not like a classic cost synergy deal; this is a transaction that puts us squarely in a space that's going to grow quickly, that comes to us with a well-developed pipeline featuring near-term opportunities to continue the attractive growth that they deliver.","And I'll get the start date wrong, but I believe that they've been growing at a compound rate of about, through 2014, of about 17% in that business. And so thinking about this business, this is more about supplementing our Livestock business, getting us into a space of where we're not presently represented. And we love this deal, we love the value of this deal and we think you will too once it starts to play out over the course of the next couple years.","I think there was a third question there was kind of capacity for more deals to say, look, we've had a great year so far in 2015. When you look at the Abbott transaction as a classic good deal for us that came up a couple of times in our prepared remarks, we're doing better both in terms of driving revenue synergies and cost synergies on that deal. I wish there were 10 of those out there to be done every year, there just aren't. But when they come up, we would certainly look to pursue additional transactions like that.","Larger more strategic transactions, like a PHARMAQ, there are a handful of opportunities out there. Do we have the capacity to do it? Well, we haven't even closed this one yet. So we'll get this one closed up and then we'll start or continue the process of looking for what that next opportunity is. M&A will continue to be an element of our strategy.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But we want to make sure that we remain very disciplined in terms of assessing opportunities for M&A and also we want to make sure that we maintain our ratios in terms of debt, which are a range between 2.5 to 3.5. That is something that we'll be also considering.","One important element that we mentioned many times is that our market share also is creating some limitations in terms of large acquisitions in terms of antitrust. But we'll continue assessing opportunities as they come and always applying a criteria that will support any kind of acquisition.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay. Next question, please?","Operator","We'll take our next question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Juan Ram\u00f3n, wondering if you could talk about the strength that you saw in some of the developing markets, like Brazil and China. I think we saw 12% operational growth and 24% in China.","And then I guess just going back to the acquisition, Paul, could you talk a little bit about the profitability of PHARMAQ and I guess the justification for the valuation or how you guys think about valuation for deals like this? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Kevin, for the question. Let me start with China. China remains a market with a significant growth potential. And we mentioned that several times that the consumption there is increasing very fast because of the increase of middle class, but also very important for our industry, they are changing also the way they are raising animals.","So in the past in China, there was significant part of animals, I'm talking about pigs, that they were small productions or even backyard production. We have seen that it's a significant shift from this kind of production to more sophisticated production and this is what is generating a significant opportunity for animal health industry that can provide the quality of a product that can increase the productivity in these farms.","We have been also investing in China since many years. We have in China the infrastructure to maximize any new products that we are bringing to the market. We have been launching new products in China, some of them as a result of a JV that we formed a couple of years ago. And we are very pleased with the all the things that are going on in China. As I said, we don't see that this economic slowdown is affecting the animal health industry.","In Brazil, the situation is different. Brazil remains a very strong market in terms of production of animal proteins for export. Brazil is one of the key markets in terms of export and they also have the benefit now of low cost in the country and also lower prices because of the real has been reducing against the dollar. So these elements are creating a very good momentum in Brazil. We have seen also Brazil that the cattle industry, it's increasing the herds. Prices of meat are also very positive.","The only comment in Brazil is that we have not seen any reduction in terms of internal consumption; what we have seen is switching from more expensive meat to less expensive. If the situation remains in the future in terms of economic crisis, we need to assess if their internal consumption will be affected. But so far, we have not seen any kind of reduction of meat consumption in Brazil, so the prospects for this country remain very positive.","Paul will talk about the acquisition.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Kevin, thanks for the question. And I think you have to think about the PHARMAQ acquisition as being comprised of two pieces, one is that base business that's been growing very quickly and, by the way, has been supporting solid investment in R&D. And that leads me to the second piece of the value, which is the pipeline opportunities that come with the company and those are both near term and they're longer term.","I said earlier I think in response to Erin's question, you've got to look at this business as being one that's very similar to ours in that it enjoys that long duration, long durability of the revenue streams, and that includes taking into consideration the near-term pipeline opportunities.","If you look at this deal on a near-term basis and say, gee, accretion and it's neutral in the first year and then it's accretive thereafter. This is a deal that goes on and enjoys that long period of sustainable growth of profit and cash flow as added into our business and so that's how we value it. We value it on a fundamental basis, not necessarily \u2013 if you're going to look at it, a sales multiple is not appropriate here.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me add a couple of comments on PHARMAQ that, in my opinion, are important. I think first, the farmed fish market is the fastest-growing market in the animal health industry. PHARMAQ has been delivering very strong growth in the last 10 years. We mentioned that a CAGR of 17%.","And, very important, PHARMAQ is focused on the area that is showing the fastest growth within aquatic health, which is vaccines. And definitely PHARMAQ is the leading company in terms of innovation in vaccines that will be a great opportunity for the future in terms of revenue growth.","So we are extremely happy with this acquisition and we are convinced that this company integrated into Zoetis and having the support of our infrastructure will also maximize the opportunities in the farmed fish.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim Partners.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So first question I had here was just on the potential for cost cuts greater than $300 million. And then a second question is just on the PHARMAQ deal again here. My understanding is that Permira had brought this company for meaningfully less two years ago. I'm just curious your thoughts here on your valuation for the company. Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of cost cuts, I think we are on track to deliver what we announced, the $300 million by 2017. And the teams are working very hard. So we have made significant progress. And as you remember, there were some elements of this program related to SKU rationalization, also the reduction of some of the manufacturing plants and also the reduction or the change in some of the markets in where we were operating direct and we will be now operating through distributor. But still, this market is representing a small part of our portfolio because 95% of the revenues are still generated through our direct interaction with customers.","So the report here is that we are doing very well and we plan to meet or exceed the $300 million.","In terms of PHARMAQ, Paul will cover this question.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. Permira bought the company back in 2013. A couple of interesting tidbits. We would've loved to have owned this company back in 2013 and tried to own this company back in 2013 and we were not able to acquire it back in 2013.","And so what has happened since then, and I think you have to take your hat off to the team at PHARMAQ and Permira for backing that team to do what they needed to do to substantially build the value of that company over the last several years.","What did they do? They advanced the pipeline, which for us is a very important factor. And while they were doing that, they continued to deliver growth in their base business and build that company. So that company is worth a heck of a lot more today than it was in 2013, number one.","And number two, I would argue that it is worth more in our hands than it's worth in other people's hands because of our opportunities to drive geographic revenue for this part of our company that is not available to a stand-alone.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the strong quarter. Paul, sorry to keep going back to this, but I think it's an important question. How profitable is PHARMAQ and what is your expected profitability for this business given increased scale as part of Zoetis?","And also, gross margin was higher than we expected. How much of that was FX as opposed to product mix? Thank you.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, with respect to the profitability of PHARMAQ, the business is profitable. It is supporting and has been supporting a substantial investment in R&D and continues to be a profitable business. Not sure we want to get into providing the entire P&L for PHARMAQ and, say, oh, here's exactly what they're doing. But suffice it to say that we think that the company, as part of Zoetis, fits with our model of long-term revenue growth and driving that over an extended period of time. And clearly we see a lot of value there.","I don't want to provide a P&L for PHARMAQ for 2014. I don't think it would tell you the whole story. The salient points again, and I'll keep coming back to this, is a base business that is growing very rapidly, a base business that has supported the investment of R&D and helped them develop a pipeline that we see a great deal of value in as we go forward.","With respect to gross margins, one thing you've got to take into consideration, I called it out in my remarks, is that FX has a favorable impact on our reported gross margin. And that was I believe roughly 100 basis points \u2013 someone will correct me if I get that wrong, but I believe it was about 100 basis points. And that turns around if FX rates happen to go in the opposite direction, but, yeah, it's roughly 100 basis points.","There are some structural things that we've done in the early stages of our supply network strategy to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and, therefore, improve margins through doing things more efficiently in the supply chain. And those are permanent and structural and that over time \u2013 this is just the early stuff with respect to the supply network strategy. We've articulated in 2020 we expect to have another couple hundred basis points of gross margin from the broader supply network strategy, which really we're just at the early stages of.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, maybe not to go into the details of the P&L for PHARMAQ, Alex, but maybe some information that can be interesting there for you. First, I think this business, it's mostly a vaccine business. So we are not talking here about maybe feed additives, but a vaccine business.","The second is that this industry is highly consolidated. So the cost to bring the products to the customers is not as expensive as in Companion Animal. So it's fewer customers and it's also providing operating ability that is related to the cost of commercialization of all the products of PHARMAQ. So what I want to say is that it's a profitable company and definitely we see the opportunity to make this company even more profitable in the future.","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Switching gears to SIMPARICA, are you still comfortable that product gets on the market in the U.S. next year? And does your guidance assume a 2016 launch?","And then maybe a just quick follow-up. You mentioned France had some tough comparisons, with antibiotic regulations kicking in a year ago. Are there any other regions where you're watching closely for perhaps more restrictive regs around production antibiotics? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me start with SIMPARICA, John. We expect the U.S. launch in SIMPARICA next year. We'll always depend on FDA approval, but we are preparing for this launch in the U.S. and also the launch in the European market.","In terms of France, France we reported that last year there was a change of legislation. So the change in the legislation was mainly eliminating rebates on sales of antibiotic and then customers bought in anticipation of this new legislation. Definitely we are monitoring any kind of changes in terms of restriction on the use of antibiotics. There are movements, mainly in Western Europe, and we are tracking all that and this has been incorporated in our guidance for 2015, 2016 and 2017.","Still, we consider that today there are no alternatives to treat animals that are sick other than antibiotics. And in many cases, the only way to achieve the productivity that customers need, we also need to prevent diseases with antibiotics. What we have seen in many markets, including the U.S., mainly a reduction of antibiotics which are medically important for human.","But again, we don't see these changing significantly our revenues in the U.S., mostly because they will be moving to other antibiotics that we also have in our portfolio.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. And we'll go to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. Congrats on all the news flow. My question relates to 2017 revenue and your guidance. Could you just remind us for some of the key new product launches, what you're incorporating into your 2017 guidance for those major new product introductions and then also whether you are excluding any new product launches from the 2017 guidance? Thanks very much.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hi, David. It's Paul. Thanks for the question. This is both 2016 and 2017 and following on from the last question, SIMPARICA is included in our 2016 and 2017 guidance. And we're expecting the o-U.S. launch of SIMPARICA and then anticipating the U.S. launch of SIMPARICA, so that's in both 2016 and 2017.","IL-31 is also in 2016 and 2017, but point out that we're currently operating under a conditional license and expecting to have a full license in the latter part of 2016. So the impact on 2016 is pretty modest. And then you see it included in our 2017 under a full license, so it's in there as well. And with respect to the question of is there anything \u2013 well, just to be super clear. And of course this now includes PHARMAQ as part of our guidance in 2016 and 2017 as well.","We only add in products to our guidance when they achieve a high probability of regulatory and technical success and these are the only new products that we have included in 2016 and 2017.","Next question, please?","Operator","Yes, and I will try Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Can you guys hear me now?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Christopher T. Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Sorry about that. Just had two questions. First, can you just elaborate on the priorities for business development following yesterday's deal? I guess my question is, just how many more assets like PHARMAQ or Abbott are out there? Is it a large universe, or is that a fairly targeted group of companies or divisions of companies you can target?","And the second question was just on APOQUEL. I appreciate the comments earlier. But when we think about 2016 growth for APOQUEL, is capacity a rate-limiting factor or is it really just how quickly you can build demand for next year? Thanks so much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with the easiest answer, which is APOQUEL. In 2016, we don't expect to have any limitation in terms of capacity and it's just the time for introducing the product in more customers in those markets in where we have already introduced the product and also launching in new markets. But we don't expect to have capacity issues. We have solved the API, we have a second source of API also in 2016 and now the manufacturing group is working to produce all the tablets that will be available to customers in 2016.","In terms of BD, opportunities like PHARMAQ are unique, so I don't think that we'll find so many opportunities like PHARMAQ in the market. But there may be some assets that can be attractive to us, not many, but it will be maybe in some countries maybe some companies that will be for sale in the future.","But, again, so we need to understand that because of our market share, we're facing some limitations in terms of antitrust that we need to incorporate in our evaluation. But we have been demonstrating that we are understanding the opportunities in the market, Abbott Animal Health, KL, PHARMAQ, and we'll continue assessing these opportunities in the future.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I want to continue on, on that because after the press release last night, we started getting a lot of questions about BD strategy and are there other, I'll put air quotes around this, big deals out there. And we want to be clear. If you'd asked us in June of 2014, say, gee, do you think you can do two right down the middle of the fairway business development deals in 2015? We would have had a fair degree of confidence that we could do that, but, as we all know, whether or not you can actually do those two deals is good material for a debate.","We're very fortunate in that 2015 we've had two very good and two very different type of deals present themselves. One, the classic tuck-in acquisition, where I mentioned before, but it's worth mentioning again, we acquired in the beginning of the year. We are achieving greater than our targeted level of cost synergies and we're delivering revenue synergies, that's a great deal. I will do that deal 100 out of 100 times.","And then secondarily, PHARMAQ, which for us from a strategic perspective and a value perspective is one of those rare deals that comes around not all that often. If you think about the aquatic health industry, it's roughly a $400 million industry and here's a company that in the very near term you would expect to have a 25% or greater share of that rapidly-growing segment. And it happens to be a business that we know a lot about.","I mean if you think about us on a fundamental level, what do we do? We are excellent at developing and promoting products to producers of animal protein for human consumption. This is right in the middle of the fairway. But if you'd asked us a year ago or more than a year ago, gee, are you going to be able to do a deal like that? We would have been hopeful, but the opportunity needs to present itself.","Two important points. One is we will maintain the discipline to focus on business development opportunities where we can leverage our particular competitive strengths to build and drive value for our shareholders. We think that there are other opportunities for us as we look out into 2016 and to 2017 and we will continue to pursue those opportunities, but I want to be clear, they're more likely to fall in the category of an Abbott-type deal than a PHARMAQ-type deal. That said, there's always opportunity. I'll stop there.","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore ISI","Thank you. It's actually Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. Congratulations for the great quarter and smart acquisition of PHARMAQ yesterday. Actually a question more about the macro situation about what else is going on in biotech. There have been a lot of chatter and noise in present from political front about potential regulation of drug prices in the human health. And Zoetis looks like being a victim of overall selloff in biotech. So I just want to hear your perspective on animal front (1:01:30) of potential regulation or even just headline from political noise from human health on animal health and Zoetis' ability to continue increasing prices on something like 2% or 3% per year.","And second question is more about long-term guidance, specifically tax rate. So whether revised guidance, additional decrease in the long-term tax rate of 100 basis points to 200 basis points, if it's sustainable or if there is additional limit to decrease tax rate even further? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Vlad. I'll start with the first question on macro environment and then Paul will answer the tax rate. So the first thing, we are not a human health company. And we try from the reading to explain how different is animal health to human health. And the most important difference is that our business is a business-to-business model. We are not dealing with a third-party payer, so our prices are defined by just the pure market dynamics. So we sell what our customers that are also paying are willing to pay for based on the value that we can demonstrate to them. So regulating prices in an industry which is just a market-driven industry will not make any sense, but it's something that we don't see happening.","And in terms of what is the macro environment, we describe that our industry is very resilient to economic dynamics. We saw that in 2008 and 2009. We also saw that in 2012 at the time of the drought that our industry responded extremely well. So one of the characteristics of animal health are stability and sustainability and we think that it is one of the attributes that make our industry very attractive to investors.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think on the tax rate question, I'll restate one of my phrases around our tax rate is, we have the opportunity to continue to lower our tax rate, but, as I said before, it's going to be evolutionary not revolutionary. We through the process of our efficiency initiative, which we kicked off in May, have taken steps to both define and simplify our global operating model. And that's had some benefits to us in terms of our global effective tax rate and that's a tax rate on our adjusted net income, by the way, and adjusted pre-tax either way (1:04:32).","And we expect that we can continue to do that, but, again, I don't want to provide anybody with the unrealistic hope that we can suddenly dramatically change our tax rate. But I think that you can see in the progression of 2015, in our guidance for 2016 and 2017 that we are continuing to take those steps that we can take in order to try to drive that tax rate down. But, again, evolutionary, not revolutionary.","Next question, please?","Operator","We'll go next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple of follow-up questions. Most of my questions have been answered. Paul, you said in your remarks that you're surprised your stock price is so low. What is your capacity for embarking on a very large share buyback program? I would think you'd want to put your money where your mouth is and if you think the stock is so cheap, why aren't you guys announcing a big buyback program?","And then secondly, Juan Ram\u00f3n, I'm sorry if I missed this, I was in and out of the call, but you talked about making an aqua health acquisition for the past couple of years. What other areas, where are there holes in your overall business areas or business segments, where do you feel \u2013 is it geographical that you'd like to fill in or is it actually product-related? What are the other businesses that you would like to be beef-up in? You were very clear about aqua health for the past couple of years. So what other businesses are you seeking to add to your portfolio? Thanks very much.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Jami, thanks for the questions. And I'll start with the share buyback. And here's a thing. We have a share buyback program; I know it's modest. And we continue to buy back shares and have been buying them back since the beginning of the year. And this is a balance between allocating capital to those activities that we think will build the most value over the long term.","And for this year it's, again, I think so far a remarkable year. Beginning of the year we allocated capital to the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health assets. Great place to put our money. Secondarily here, hopefully on or about November 10 we'll close on the PHARMAQ acquisition. These represent deployment of capital ways that we'll continue to build value for our shareholders over the long term.","While we're doing that, we continue to buy back shares. To the extent that we find ourselves in an environment where we have lots of cash flow and nowhere to deploy it in a way that we felt was value generative, yeah, we could increase the scale of our share buyback. But right now, going out and levering up the company to buy back a bunch of shares is not something that we're going to do.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Jami, thank you for the question. And let me describe where we're at now. So definitely before the acquisition of PHARMAQ, the only area that was significant for animal health and where we were not participating was aquaculture or this aquatic health. Now, with the acquisition of PHARMAQ, we have filled this gap.","So now we are number one in cattle, we are number two in companion animal. But I think we have been taking all the actions to have a stronger position in this category with a launch of APOQUEL, the acquisition of Abbott Animal Health and also our internal efforts in terms of R&D, to bring new parasiticide that was an area where we were underrepresented. We are convinced that we have all what we need to compete in this space.","We are number one in swine and we are number three in poultry. And definitely in poultry we see opportunities if they come to consider some acquisitions of products or other assets. We incorporated a small acquisition in poultry this year, mainly on devices. And we are also working internally to develop the portfolio and the pipeline that will bring us to a stronger position.","In terms of geographies, we have a very strong position in all the of the markets. And very important, in those markets where we don't have yet the position that we should have is not because we don't have the portfolio, it's only a question of registering the portfolio and bringing this portfolio to the market. So I see in terms of geographies more opportunistic than need.","And then moving to what will be other opportunities, definitely any area that will be complementary to our core business, which are medicines, that can enhance these core business and create additional revenues and profits will be part of our assessment.","Next question, please?","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Doug Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Douglas D. Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe clarify on APOQUEL. So will you be at a state without any supply constraints by the end of this year, or will that sort of take place in phases over next year?","And just in terms of the second source of API, is that going to be a back-up source or is that going to be a source that is going to be regularly contributing towards production? Thank you very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug. And in terms of APOQUEL supply, we expect to have a supply for meeting the demands of customers in the U.S. and UK markets at the end of the year. Then we'll continue introducing the product in other markets. And we don't think that supply will be an issue to deliver all customer demand in 2016.","The second API source, it will be not just of a back-up, it will be a contributor. And we have the opportunity to double the capacity of the existing capacity that we have. And this is also something that will protect future revenues of future demand for the product. So we are very confident that the API will be enough to produce all the finished product that will be demanded by the customers in 2016.","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions, so I will return the floor to Juan Ram\u00f3n for closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So thank you very much for attending this call. And, again, we are very pleased to have the results of this third quarter. But more important, my opinion, it's how confident are we in terms of our future, in terms of revenues and in terms also of adjusted EPS. We are very confident that we'll be delivering very strong results despite of the negative impact of exchange rate. That has been compensated with the introduction of new products and also the performance of the rest of the portfolio.","So with that, thank you very much for attending this call.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference.

I\u2019m joined today by Juan Ramon Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer, and Glenn David, our Senior Vice President of Finance Operations and acting Chief Financial Officer. Juan Ramon and Glenn will provide an overview our quarterly results and then we will open the call for your questions.","Before we begin, let me remind you that the earnings press release and financial tables can be found on the Investor Relations section of Zoetis.com. We are also providing a simultaneous webcast of this morning\u2019s call which can be accessed on the website as well. A PDF version of today\u2019s slides and a transcript of the call will be available on the website later today.","Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today\u2019s press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our 2013 10-K and 10-Qs. Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP adjusted figures exclude the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items such as the non-recurring cost of becoming a standalone public company. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our press release and in the company\u2019s 8-K filing dated today, May 6, 2014. We also cite operational results which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","Prior to the completion of our IPO last year, Zoetis was not an independent public company and the first quarter of 2013 includes results from periods that were derived from the consolidated financial statements and records of Pfizer, which can make comparisons difficult in certain instances. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, John. Hello everyone. Before moving into some of the details of our call today, I would first like to address a recent change in the company\u2019s executive team. On April 22, we announced that Glenn David, Senior Vice President of Finance Operations was named the company\u2019s acting Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019m delighted that Glenn is here with me on today\u2019s call and he will speak with you as we move through the details of our first quarter performance. But first, let me share some of the highlights from the quarter, beginning with our high level financials.","We concluded the first quarter with revenue growth of 1% or 4% operational. Adjusted net income for the first quarter was $191 million or $0.38 per diluted shares, increases of 7% and 6% compared to the first quarter of 2013. As a result and due to our ability to successfully navigate multiple headwinds in the first quarter, we are reaffirming our guidance for revenue and adjusted net income for the full year 2014. ","At the species level, we delivered 6% operational growth in companion animals and 4% operational growth in livestock. The 6% growth in companion animals was driven by a strong performance in Latin American countries due to the continued increase in the medicalization rates and the positive impact of our new canine product, Apoquel, in the U.S., U.K., and Germany. Companion animal sales in the quarter were affected by the cold weather in the U.S. which reduced the number of pet owner visits to veterinarian clinics. In livestock, sales of our swine portfolio grew by 6%. This growth was tempered by the continued spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or PEDv, especially in the United States. Our poultry portfolio performed well, also growing by 6% in the U.S. Our Rotecc product which enhances our ability to deliver solutions focused on sound rotation principles for coccidiosis management, has been an important driver of this performance. Avian flu in some markets continued to impact the poultry industry. In cattle, we delivered operational growth of 13%. Performance in the U.S. and in Latin America was strong while performance in Australia and some European markets declined. ","I would now like to share with you some of the performance highlights for our four regions. In Asia Pacific, we delivered operational revenue growth of 4%. Revenue for the region\u2019s emerging markets grew by 14%, offsetting a decline in the more developed markets. We remain confident that for the full year, operational growth for the region will be faster than the average of Zoetis. Despite positive performance in Japan, New Zealand and China, sales of companion animal products declined by 2%. This was mainly due to the timing and price and promotional activities in Australia, a market that represents 36% of our companion animal revenue in the Asia Pacific region. In livestock, our business grew by 7%. The strong revenue growth in countries like China and India was partially offset by the negative growth in Japan, New Zealand and Australia. In Australia, it was due to the ongoing conditions of the weather in the market.","Our business in Canada-Latin America delivered operational growth of 10% with companion animals and livestock growing 15% and 9%. Companion animal growth in the region was driven by the continued increase in the medicalization rates in the majority of the Latin American countries and the positive results in Canada. In livestock, we delivered strong performance in our poultry business in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and Peru. Here demand for our medicated feed additives was particularly strong. We saw positive performance of our cattle business with strong contributions from Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. ","Our business in Europe-Africa-Middle East declined by 4% operationally. This performance was primarily associated with the declines of our livestock product sales, which Glenn will cover in his remarks. During the first quarter of 2014, the companion animal business in EuAfME grew by 1% thanks to the successful launch of Apoquel in the U.K., Germany and certain other markets. In addition, we saw a positive response to our promotional activity for our parasiticide portfolio in France, Italy and several emerging markets in the region. We also saw additional competition for our vaccines and (indiscernible). Livestock sales in the region declined 6% operationally. Despite this decline, we saw positive performance of the cattle business in southern Europe and in some emerging markets in the region.","Now to the U.S., where the business grew by 6%. This result was driven by a number of factors. First in companion animals, the business grew by 18%. Here we saw the positive impact of the launch of Apoquel which partially offset the impact of cold weather conditions that reduced the number of visits by pet owners to veterinarian clinics. Then in livestock in the U.S., we delivered 7% growth. This was positively impacted by the performance of our cattle business which was due in part to a higher number of feed lot placements, the higher price of (indiscernible), and the cold weather that increased demand for respiratory vaccines and antibiotics. We are encouraged by signs of the U.S. cattle being rebuilt after drought conditions (indiscernible). Poultry in the U.S. continued its strong performance. Many factors have contributed to this growth. These include our Rotecc program mentioned previously and the successful introduction of our conditionally licensed Georgia 08 vaccine, and in addition we have seen growth in our (indiscernible) poultry vaccine line. ","Our swine business in the U.S. continued to be impacted by the ongoing spread of PEDv. As a result of the virus, the USDA forecasts a reduction in the size of the U.S. swine herd of approximately 10%. Despite this, we delivered growth due to the positive performance of the products that we introduced in 2013, such as Draxxin 25 and Engain. ","As in previous quarters, the business of both our producers and veterinarian customers continued to feel the impact of a number of external factors such as weather and disease outbreaks. These factors have a degree of impact on our own performance given the nature of the direct relationships that we have with our customers. On climate, customers in the markets in the southern hemisphere such as Australia and New Zealand have continued to be adversely affected by the drought conditions. These conditions negative impact our livestock business due to the pressure they place on producers to feed and maintain large herds. In the northern hemisphere, a very cold winter has negatively impacted our customers. In our livestock business, these conditions created an increased need for anti-infective vaccines. In our companion animal business, it had reduced the number of visits being made to vet clinics in the quarter. While these conditions have been particularly harsh and extreme in some markets, they are the reality that our customers face on an ongoing basis.","Moving now to disease outbreaks, the spread of PEDv that we have talked about previously continues. During the last quarter, PEDv has continued to spread into the U.S. as well as in Mexico and Canada. In the U.S., 30 states have now confirmed at least one case of PEDv and reports suggest that approximately half of the U.S. sow population has been infected. In Mexico, the virus has reportedly infected nearly a third of swine herds. The virus has also continued to be active in Asia Pacific with active cases present in a range of new markets, including Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. These add to instances of the virus having been reported in China, Thailand the Philippines. Herds are being hit hard by the outbreak and fewer piglets are surviving. ","With higher prices being paid for swine herds when they go to the market, we believe that producers may now be investing more in keeping those still in their herds healthy. This means that they will likely turn to premium products to achieve a greater return of investment from growing pigs, especially as market prices for pork products continue to increase. At Zoetis, we have advanced our research efforts to understand the safety, efficacy and manufacturing of an effective vaccine candidate. This is in partnership with Iowa State University and we continue to make progress in pursuit of a diagnostic tool in collaboration with the University of Minnesota. We are actively monitoring the continued evolution of the PEDv outbreak on the swine industry as well as any impact in our revenues. ","One of the core characteristics of our business is the depth and diversity of our product portfolio. This enables us to actively minimize the challenge created by any given species, geography, therapeutic area, or product. As we have shared with you previously, our R&D effort is focused not only on the development of new products but also the life cycle development and continuous improvement of all our brand assets. During the first quarter of 2014, we continued to secure regulatory approvals for existing products that have been introduced into new geographies or that have their indications or claim extended. Furthermore, during the first quarter we launched a number of new products. This includes Bovishield Gold Oneshot, Fostera PCV, Fostera PRRS in Canada, Latin America and Thailand. Also on the topic of new products, I will provide a brief update on Apoquel. ","Apoquel is an historic product for Zoetis and also for the industry. It joins our portfolio of already gold standard products and industry-leading brands across species and will have a positive impact on our business moving forward. In the first quarter, we continued to see high levels of customer acceptance for this innovative new treatment. The product was launched in the U.S., U.K., Germany, and certain other markets. The strong demand we have seen for the product has exceeded our initial expectations and has been generated by customers switching faster than anticipated from existing treatment options to Apoquel. ","The manufacturing process for Apoquel is complex and lengthy. This means that our ability to significantly ramp up production quickly to meet the high level of demand is limited. As a result, there are some restrictions on stock availability. To ensure that dog currently on Apoquel continue to receive treatment, we are allocating current product availability to those patients. Based on current reactions, we expect the situation to be normalized by the end of the first quarter 2015 and for Apoquel to represent approximately 1% of revenue by the end of 2014. ","Moving now to the close of my remarks. First, let me say that I see our overall performance for the first quarter of 2014 as positive. This is because we delivered operational growth in revenue of 4% and in adjusted net income of 8% while absorbing multiple headwinds. Second, Zoetis remains committed to its full-year guidance number on revenues and EPS previously provided. Our revenue growth for the year is in line or faster than expected market growth, now that the (indiscernible) has reduced their industry outlook for 2014. They now expect growth to be at the rate of around 2% in nominal U.S. dollar terms and around 5% in constant currency terms.","With that, thank you for your attention and I will now ask Glenn to walk us through the financial results. Glenn?","Glenn David","Thank you, Juan Ramon. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here today and to join you as acting Chief Financial Officer. As some of you know, I have been working with Juan Ramon since 2011 when I joined the Pfizer animal health business, and I\u2019ve been part of the Zoetis earnings process for the last year in my role as Senior Vice President of Finance Operations. Let me start today with a review of the first quarter results and then discuss our guidance for full-year 2014.","Turning to the income statement slide, for the first quarter revenue was approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 1% year-over-year including a negative impact of 3 percentage points from foreign exchange, so operational growth excluding currency was 4%. Reported net income was $155 million or $0.31 per diluted share and adjusted net income was $191 million or $0.38 per diluted share, representing growth of 7% and 6% respectively. Adjusted net income for the quarter excludes the after-tax impact of $36 million or $0.07 per diluted share for purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, and certain significant items. ","Let\u2019s now turn to our adjusted net income statement slide, which I will discuss primarily on an operational basis. Again, operational revenue growth was 4%. Companion animal sales were 35% of sales in the quarter and grew $12 million or 3%. Livestock sales were 64% of sales in the quarter and grew $28 million or 4%. The remaining 1% of sales is attributed to client supply services which was realigned this quarter. I will explain more about that in a minute.","Adjusted cost of sales declined operationally by about 2% due to the impact of unfavorable items in the prior year\u2019s quarter. Adjusted cost of sales was 34.2% of revenue versus 36.5% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the operational decline in cost of sales as well as a 50 basis point benefit in the current quarter from foreign exchange. We expect our cost of sales to increase as a percent of revenue in the remaining quarters, particularly in the second half of the year, and bring us in line with the full-year guidance we are reaffirming today. This reflects the recognition of additional costs from building our global manufacturing and supply organization which will be most evident in the second half of the year, as well as our expectation that foreign exchange will not have as favorable an impact on gross margin.","Meanwhile, adjusted SG&A increased by 4% operationally in the first quarter. In the first two quarters of 2013, we were still building out many of the corporate functions needed to support Zoetis as an independent public company. We largely completed this process in the third quarter of last year and this unfavorable comparison is the primary driver of SG&A growth in the first quarter of 2014, accounting for approximately half of the increase in this expense. Adjusted R&D expense decreased 2% operationally.","Interest expense was up $7 million in the quarter due to the completion of our debt offering at the end of January 2013. This reflects the impact of an additional month of interest expense versus the prior year which is greater than the one month of interest allocation we received from Pfizer in our carve-out financials. Overall, we did a good job on expense management in the first quarter. Our operating expenses grew at a slower pace than revenue, even when including the unfavorable comparison in SG&A that I mentioned. ","Adjusted other income and deductions was negatively impacted by $5 million in FX losses related to the Argentine peso. In the year-ago quarter, we reflected the impact of the currency devaluation in Venezuela. In our segment reporting, you will find the impact from the Argentine peso in our corporate line item while the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela in 2013 is reported as part of our Canada-Latin America segment. ","Our effective adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 31%. This rate is elevated versus prior periods due to the impact of a discrete item in the quarter, but we continue to expect an effective tax rate for the year of approximately 29%. Again, our adjusted net income was $191 million, representing reported growth of 7% and operational growth of 8%. This performance demonstrates our ability to grow adjusted earnings faster than revenue despite the challenges we have outlined.","Now onto our segment results. I will discuss these on an operational basis, but it should be noted that segment earnings are pre-tax numbers and reported on an adjusted basis. I will also highlight some of the more significant foreign exchange impacts in the regional results. I want to mention that effective this quarter, we have realigned our segment reporting with respect to our client supply services organization, or CSS, which provides contract manufacturing services for third parties. The revenue and earnings associated with CSS are now reported within other business activities separate from the four reportable segments. In 2013, CSS results were reported in the EuAfME segment. First quarter results for 2014 and 2013 reflect the new segment structure. ","Beginning with the U.S., first quarter revenue was $479 million, an increase of 6%. As Juan Ramon discussed earlier, sales of livestock products grew 7% with contributions across cattle, poultry and swine. Sales of companion animal products grew 3%. This was driven by the introduction of Apoquel which was partially offset by the effects of cold weather conditions in the first quarter. Meanwhile, U.S. segment earnings increased 19% due to revenue growth, improvement in cost of goods, and the delayed timing of promotional investments based on the unfavorable weather impact in the quarter. ","Now turning to our Europe-Africa-Middle East region, or EuAfME. In EuAfME, first quarter revenue was $270 million, a decrease of 4% operationally. Sales of livestock products decreased 6% operationally. This decline was largely driven by the U.K. and is the result of two major factors: first, an unfavorable comparison to the year-ago quarter regarding rebates which should normalize throughout the year; second, in 2014 we have taken actions to more tightly monitor and manage customer inventory build-ups that normally occur in advance of price increases. These efforts negatively impacted our livestock product growth in the quarter.","Meanwhile, poultry products were negatively impacted by regulatory issues which have since been resolved, and swine products were impacted by competitive pricing issues and a reduction in the use of anti-infectives. All of these items were tempered by the growth of cattle product sales in emerging markets. Meanwhile, sales of companion animal products grew 1% operationally primarily due to the introduction of Apoquel. EuAfME segment earnings decreased 2% operationally primarily due to the revenue decline which was mitigated by strong expense discipline. ","Turning to our Canada and Latin America segment, or CLAR, first quarter revenue was $168 million, an increase of 10% operationally. This segment saw significant negative impact on revenue of 12 percentage points due to foreign exchange. The FX impact was primarily due to shifts in Brazil as well as Argentina and Canada. Sales of livestock products grew 9% operationally driven largely by poultry in Brazil and cattle and swine product sales across other Latin American markets. Livestock sales in Canada were relatively flat.","Sales in companion animal products grew 15% operationally largely due to increased sales in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. CLAR segment earnings increased 11% on an operational basis, driven by strong revenue growth as well as gross margin and operating expense levels that stayed in line with revenues. Reported growth of 23% is higher than the operational growth, which was primarily driven by the unfavorable impact of the currency devaluation in Venezuela in the first quarter of 2013 which we discussed earlier.","In Asia Pacific, or APAC, first quarter sales were $169 million, an increase of 4% operationally. Our APAC segment also felt the significant impact from foreign exchange with the Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Indian rupee all contributing to a negative 7 percentage point impact on revenue. Sales of livestock products grew 75 operationally driven primarily by sales of swine products in China and Japan, poultry products in India, and cattle products in China. This growth was slightly offset by a decline in cattle product sales in Japan, New Zealand and Australia. ","Sales of companion animal products declined 2% operationally largely due to declines in Australia driven by competitive pressures in parasiticides and declines in customer inventory levels related to the timing of price increases versus the prior year. APAC segment operating earnings decreased 2% operationally due to unfavorable mix as well as the timing of promotional investments. ","Now let me turn to guidance for the full-year 2014. We have now reported one quarter of the fiscal year and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year financial guidance. As a result, we are reaffirming all aspects of our financial guidance for full-year 2014. We continue to expect reported revenue of approximately $4.65 billion to $4.75 billion for the full year. This guidance also reflects an unfavorable impact of approximately 1.5 percentage points related to the year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. You would typically expect the foreign exchange impact on the bottom line to be relatively consistent with our overall margins; however, there are mitigating items in other P&L line items this year that largely offset this impact. Please note that our guidance does not include any further currency devaluations in Venezuela.","Our guidance on adjusted cost of goods sold for full-year 2014 remains approximately 35.5% of revenue, roughly flat year-over-year. This reflects the anticipated benefit of price, volume and ongoing cost saving efforts which is forecasted to be offset by the full-year impact of cost incurred to build global manufacturing and supply functions as well as unfavorable mix. The incremental costs will be reflected primarily in the second half of 2014.","Adjusted SG&A expenses are expected to be between $1.43 billion and $1.48 billion for the full year. We expect between 1% to 2% of operational growth in this line item to come from the unfavorable comparison in our corporate functions. Adjusted R&D expenses are expected to be between $390 million and $405 million for the full year. We continue to expect our effective tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 29% for the full year. This guidance does not reflect the potential extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit in 2014. ","Finally, we continue to expect adjusted EPS of between $1.48 and $1.54 per share. This guidance reflects our ability to achieve our profitability targets as we absorb multiple headwinds in 2014, including the incremental cost of standing up our global manufacturing and supply operations, unfavorable comparisons in corporate function expense, and an additional month of higher interest expense. Separately, we continue to estimate pre-tax charges for 2014 of between $165 million and $185 million primarily related to stand-up and acquisition-related costs which are excluded from our adjusted earnings guidance. Including the impact of these items, as well as purchase accounting adjustments, our guidance for reported diluted EPS for full-year 2014 remains between $1.15 and $1.21 per share.","This annual guidance reflects our confidence in the diversity of our portfolio, the strength of our business model, and our view of the evolving market conditions for animal health products this year. Our long-term value proposition remains anchored in three objectives: to grow revenue in line with or faster than the market, to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue, and to find investment opportunities with strong returns to our business and return excess capital to shareholders.","That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we will open the line for your questions. John?","John O\u2019Connor","Thank you, Glenn. Operator, first question, please.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Our first question is coming from Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jessica Fye \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey there, it\u2019s Jessica Fye on for Chris. Two questions \u2013 one, can you just elaborate on the cattle trends in the U.S. this quarter. What inning are we in in terms of recovery from the drought, and maybe mention feed lot and positive herd size trends. And then secondly, recognizing that there are going to be some quarter-to-quarter variability in your business, are there any trends you\u2019re seeing in the second quarter thus far that we should be aware of?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Jessica. Let me answer the comment on cattle and then also the recovery that we can see on the second quarter. So on cattle, definitely the drought impact has been already solved, and the drought mainly impacted the price of the corn. The price of the corn now, it\u2019s at a level which is in line with what we had before the drought impact. But we have seen in the U.S. is that the cattle has been declining in 2013. According to information that we have from external sources, the cattle herd declined by 2%, which compares the number of animals at the beginning of January of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. We expect that now that the price of beef is very high, it\u2019s really reaching record highs in terms of price, there will be an incentive for cattle producers to rebuild the herd; but this will take some years, as we expressed previously, because it takes two to three years really to have these rebuilt. We expect that at the end of 2014, the herd will have a small increase of a little bit less than 1%. Also, because of some of the cows will be kept to rebuild the herd, there will be less placement during 2014. We saw a significant increase in the first quarter in the number of placements by 5%. We expect that in the following quarters, this will have some moderated placement and at the end of the year will be in line with 2013 or slightly below.","In terms of what we expect for the following quarter, I think we have some unique items in the first quarter. In the U.K., Australia, also the cold weather in the U.S., we expect these items not affecting our performance in the quarter, and if you see our guidance, we are maintaining the guidance which means we expect higher growth in the remaining quarters. Additionally, we have a significant impact on foreign exchange in the first quarter. Based on current exchange rates, we expect that in the second quarter the impact will be much lower. ","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Two questions for you guys. First, Juan Ramon, could you give us your thoughts on the pig virus, what the impact was this quarter, and I think you guys had a new product, ractopomine Engain that was expected to launch in Q1. I\u2019m wondering if it did and how it\u2019s doing. And then the second question I had, had to do with the weather impact in the U.S. on the companion animal business. Could you quantify that for us, and what sort of growth have you seen coming out into the second quarter? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Kevin. So let\u2019s start with PEDv. The PEDv, it\u2019s affecting significantly the swine industry. The estimate of the total impact is 50% of sows have been affected by the virus, and this is translating into something like a 10% reduction on the herd in swine. The impact on the first quarter as well as the rest of the quarters is something that we are incorporating in our guidance, and we are also managing this situation because again, the price of pork is very high and this is also incentivating producers to use products that will protect better the animal that will have more value. So we have in one side, the negative impact of PEDv affecting a number of animals, but at the same time the high value of these animals which is increasing the use of premium price, which is the space where we mostly compete. So there are two elements that are in some way balancing, although the impact on PEDv will be higher.","In terms of ractopomine, we launched Engain. This product is specifically for swine. The product has been introduced already and it\u2019s\u2014the results are in line with our expectations, and we expect Engain to compensate partially the negative impact of PEDv. ","In terms of companion animals that you also asked what was the impact of the cold weather in the U.S., the impact was mainly related to two factors: one, it was a reduced number of visits to veterinarian clinics, and second there was a delay in terms of growing tics and fleas. Now the situation, it\u2019s normalized and we expect that this temporary impact will be compensated in the second quarter. Definitely we have some revenues that will be lost because of these pet owners not visiting the clinics, but on the total year we don\u2019t think that this will represent a significant impact. In any case, it is already incorporated in our guidance.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Redford \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning, this is David Redford on behalf of Alex Arfaei. I was wondering if you could add a bit more color to the discrete item that increased your tax rate this quarter and whether or not you\u2019re open to a transaction that would lower your tax rate, such as a merger or tax inversion.","Juan Ramon Alaix","I will ask Glenn to answer this question, David.","Glenn David","Sure, so thanks for the question, David. Related to the higher ETR in the quarter, it\u2019s driven by a non-recurring discrete item, as we discussed, and it\u2019s related to an intercompany inventory adjustment. While the impact is fairly significant for the quarter, over the course of the year we believe it\u2019s very manageable within the overall tax rate that we reaffirmed today of approximately 29%.","In terms of our view of entering into any further transactions, we continue to evaluate all options to increase the value of our business. At this point in time, we do not see ourselves entering into a transaction like you mentioned, and I also want to mention that we are subject to certain provisions under the Tax Matters Agreement which might limit our ability to do that.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Please go ahead.","Wesley Nurss \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, this (indiscernible) sitting in for Mark today. I have one quick follow-up on the gross margins. Was there any impact to the gross margin related to geographic or species mix, and could that affect kind of the trend for the remainder of the year? I also had a question about Apoquel. You mentioned that supply was outpacing demand. Can you quantify that to any extent? And then also, I believe I heard for Apoquel there were some manufacturing issues related to that product. Isn\u2019t Apoquel just a small molecule? Can you describe a little bit further some of the challenges there and why it will take until the first quarter of \u201915 to resolve those issues? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Wes. I will answer on Apoquel and then Glenn will cover the question on the gross margin. Apoquel is still having big sales over time, reaching the status of (indiscernible), so more than $100 million, and we remain confident that this product will significantly exceed this $100 million. What we estimated for 2014 was a switch from current therapies, mainly steroids, to Apoquel at a different rate than we have seen after the introduction of the product, so this has created a higher demand than expected, and because of manufacturing it\u2019s complex, we need to really produce all this product, which is a small molecule, but it takes something like 12 months from the raw materials through API \u2013 active pharma ingredient \u2013 and then finished good. We have the limitations of this lengthy manufacturing period to ramp up production and to meet all the demand of the market. As I said, we expect that the manufacturing will be normalized in 2015 and at that time we\u2019ll be able really to supply all the demand for the product. ","And now, Glenn will answer the question on gross margin.","Glenn David","Sure. So in relation to the question on gross margin and specifically to geographic mix, emerging markets did outpace revenue growth of the developed markets this quarter, so that was a negative driver on mix for the quarter; however, in terms of the favorable impacts of gross margin, we referenced the impact of foreign exchange providing about a 50 basis point benefit. That\u2019s driven by the fact that FX at revenue had a negative impact of 3% but at adjusted cost of sales it had a favorable impact of 4%, so that drove the 50 basis point improvement.","The other thing in terms of cost of sales is we do expect the cost of goods sold in the second half of the year to increase as the cost of building up our global manufacturing and supply organization will be most evident in the second half, and that will bring us in line with the 35.5% guidance we confirmed today.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to John Krieger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Krieger \u2013 William Blair","Hi, thanks very much. Can you talk about any changes that you might be seeing among your customers in anti-infective usage? I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw some reduction in swine. Are you seeing any signs that that might be broadening out to other regions or other species?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you for the question. Definitely the pressure to reduce the use of antibiotics in regions like Europe and more specifically in western Europe continues affecting industry revenues. In 2013, the use of anti-infectives in Europe declined by 7%. This was not only because of the pressure but also the introduction of some generic products into this space. If you will compare the 7% of the industry decline to our 2% decline, it indicates that we have been managing very well the challenge on antibiotics in western Europe and we have been able really, thanks to the breadth of our portfolio and the direct interaction with our customers, to maintain a strong position in antibiotics. The antibiotic pressure was mainly focused on northern Europe while in southern Europe or eastern Europe or Africa-Middle East, we don\u2019t see a significant restriction on the use of anti-infectives. If I move to other regions, I would say that in the U.S., for instance, the focus has been on restrictions related to the use of anti-infectives in growth promotion. We agree with the FDA to remove this indication from our label to those products have this growth promotion indication, and overall we think that despite this pressure that definitely will continue in Europe, and we have seen new regulations in countries like Belgium or France. We expect the antibiotic to continue growing at a lower basis, although a lower pace than the growth of animal health.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson \u2013 Bank of America","Great, this is Erin Wilson in for Willoughby. On Apoquel, will there be significant incremental cost associated with normalizing supply by 2015, and can you speak to also the recent industry consolidation based on your experience following the Wyeth and Pfizer merger and other mergers as well? Could you benefit potentially from divestitures in specific product lines from some of your competitors? Does that represent an opportunity for you to benefit from sales force defections or other changes?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Erin, and I will ask Glenn to comment on this question on the cost.","Glenn David","So Erin, specific to your question on Apoquel, we don\u2019t see a significant increase in cost related to ramping up production. In general, increased volumes relate to additional efficiencies and should be a beneficial factor to cost in the long term.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Okay, and you also asked about M&A and the consolidation of\u2014the impact in terms of the consolidation. So first, I think the recent news on this consolidation, in my opinion, are positive for the animal health industry because they are showing the high value of the assets in this industry. At the same time, I don\u2019t see that this is changing significantly the competitive landscape, so in our opinion the model that we have, which is going to the market that we have a direct force, direct sales force, also supporting our revenue with innovation in terms of R&D, and high quality manufacturing is a model that has been showing significant strength. As a reference, in 2013 the market grew by 7%--4%, sorry, and Zoetis grew by 7%. This indicates that despite the challenge or despite consolidation and even the time that we were involved in the separation from Pfizer, so we were able to grow much faster than the market.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Chris Caponetti \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks very much. It\u2019s Chris Caponetti for Dave. I was hoping you could tell me what operating cash flow was during the quarter, and then separately if you could just prioritize your uses of cash given what appears to be, I guess, a more limited interest in transformative M&A, at least over the near term. Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","I will ask Glenn to go into the details of this cash plan, but let me have some general comments on our cash philosophy. Definitely Zoetis will generate predictable and steady cash flow. We will identify opportunities that will increase the value of our company, and one of the areas that we think that we can increase value is also accessing opportunities in terms of M&A. We will assess opportunities based on (indiscernible) and also the return on the investment, and definitely we have integrated many companies in the past. We have the knowledge and the capabilities to make these integrations successful and we will continue assessing any opportunity that the market will offer.","And now, Glenn can provide some additional comments on cash.","Glenn David","Sure. So in terms of the cash flow statement for the quarter, as part of our earnings release process we don\u2019t provide balance sheet or cash flow information. That information will be available in the 10-Q to be filed next week.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Louise Chin with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Louise Chin \u2013 Guggenheim","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first question I had was on your pricing power. I know you\u2019ve historically been able to drive a lot of pricing power, and I\u2019m curious is that is particular to Zoetis or it\u2019s sort of an industry-wide figure. And then secondly on cash flow, based on my modeling, it looks like you\u2019ll be generating a lot of strong cash flow over the next several years, and I was wondering if you could comment if that is a correct assumption or not. Then lastly, we\u2019ve gotten some pushback on your operating cost \u2013 you know, that you\u2019re going to have to separate from Pfizer and that cost is higher than expected. I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re going to meet your gross margin and operating margin expansion targets despite the near-term increase in costs. Thank you. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Louise, for the questions. Definitely we have pricing power and then we have increasing prices in most of the countries. Definitely in countries which are more developed, we have more opportunities to increase prices while in emerging markets, because of local competition, we see the opportunity in terms of volume higher than prices. In general in the industry, it\u2019s also increasing prices, and according to external sources (indiscernible), they are indicating that on the total growth anticipated for 2014, this 5% will be balanced between price and volume. We are confident that because of our model and the strength of our portfolio, we\u2019ll be able really to implement the price increases in most of the geographies.","In terms of the question on separating costs, maybe Glenn can provide some comments on that.","Glenn David","Sure. So the guidance that we reaffirmed today does include some certain significant items and acquisition-related costs primarily related to standing up the organization that we\u2019ll experience in 2014. In terms of the operating costs, the guidance also reflects some of the dyssynergies that we may experience this year related to being an independent company, and we highlighted some of those in terms of the incremental costs related to our corporate functions and some of the incremental costs in terms of building up our global manufacturing and supply organization, but we still believe in the long-term ability to be able to grow expenses at the rate of inflation.","Juan Ramon Alaix","And let me finish with your question on cash flow. Definitely this company will generate cash in a way that will be strong and also predictable and steady, and we will use the cash in a way that will maximize the value of Zoetis and also the value for the shareholders.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.","Liav Abraham \u2013 Citi","Good morning. Just a follow-up question on your tax rate. I understand from your commentary that you\u2019re not focused on a tax inversion at this point, at least not in a material way. Can you talk to the opportunities that you have for potential reduction of your tax rate on a standalone basis over the medium term? Thanks very much. ","Glenn David","Sure. So in reaffirming our tax rate of 29%, we also indicated that that does not include the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which could provide an additional benefit of about 50 basis points. I\u2019ll just reaffirm what the company has said in the past, that the rate of approximately 29% is generally the long range rate in which we think we could operate.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jamie Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ariel Herman \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, this is Ariel Herman in for Jamie. So just a couple quick ones. Regarding Apoquel, how much did this contribute to your overall growth, so another way of asking this is what would the growth be ex-Apoquel? And then when you think about new products versus the current or base business, how should we think about the growth in each of the segments, so how fast are new products growing versus potentially the base business declining? Then separately just to follow up on the industry consolidation question, I believe you stated previously that scale is one of the strengths of Zoetis, so if competitors are getting bigger and consolidating, how could this potentially affect you? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Ariel. On Apoquel, Apoquel will represent in 2014 approximately 1% of our total revenues, so it means that in terms of revenue growth, it will represent also about this 1%. Our model is not based on bringing new products to compensate the loss of exclusivity or the duration of the old portfolio, but our model is to continue investing in our current portfolio in a way which is a balance with the investment that we make in generating new products. So because of generic competition has a different impact in our industry, we are able really to continue supporting our product with (indiscernible) life cycle management. We can continue investing in indications, we can continue investing in the current portfolio, moving a product from different species. We can also work on combining producers to maintain these products fresh and generating growth, and also we can invest in expanding our portfolio geographically. Definitely new products will represent a portion of our growth, and if you take our total growth, a portion will come from price- we mentioned that this will be approximately 50% of our revenue growth will be coming from price, and then in terms of volume two-thirds will be coming from our current portfolio and the way that we are maintaining our current portfolio life, and one-third will be coming from new products. These are general statements that can be different depending on the years and depending on the new product introductions or the success of being in also innovation to our current portfolio.","In terms of what will be the impact of the consolidation since some of our competitors will increase scale, we are already competing with large companies, companies that already generate more than $3 billion, and we have been proving that our business model is extremely effective and efficient, and we based our model, as I mentioned, in our great introductions, bringing innovation in both new products and supporting our existing portfolio, and the quality and reliable supply. The combination of all these elements and the way that we are executing our strategies is what is making our differentiation in the market, and we are convinced that despite this consolidation we remain very competitive and growing in line or slightly faster than the market, despite having a market share of 20%. And very important, also our plan is to increase our earnings faster than revenues with the right focus on expenses and also the right focus on improving gross margin.","John O\u2019Connor","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our last question from David Krempa with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","David Krempa \u2013 Morningstar","Great, thanks for taking the question. If we look at the significant differences in margin compared to the international markets versus the U.S., would you say the biggest driving factor there is solely the pricing or are there still scale benefits you can realize there that should improve as you grow, or at nearly a billion dollars in these regions are you already taking advantage of all the scale opportunities there and we shouldn\u2019t expect any significant increases in these margins going forward?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Well, margins are definitely affected by the product mix and also affected by species mix and geography mix. In smaller markets, we don\u2019t have the same economies of scale that we can generate in the U.S. As these markets are growing, we\u2019ll see also that the margin will improve because they will increase the absorption of all the expense infrastructure that we have been building to maximize the opportunities in these markets. I\u2019m convinced that our margin will continue growing. As I mentioned, we\u2019ll be growing revenues in line or faster than market, but margins or earnings will be growing faster than revenues. This will increase our margin opportunities.","I don\u2019t know, Glenn, if you want to add any additional comment on that?","Glenn David","No, the only thing I\u2019ll add is to Juan Ramon\u2019s point about the expectation to grow revenue\u2014to grow income faster than revenue. We expect that across all of our regions, both the developed and the emerging.","Operator","I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Juan Ramon for any closing or additional remarks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","So thank you, all of you for joining us on today\u2019s call, and thank you for your interest in Zoetis and our first quarter performance.

You may begin, sir.","John O'Connor - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, operator. Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. I'm joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a full list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings including but not limited to our 2014 annual report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures which were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the company's 8-K filing dated today, February 16, 2016. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. In today's call I will provide perspective color based on the performance for the full year 2015 and our goals for 2016. Paul will discuss some of the fourth quarter highlights, the 2015 net results and our guidance for 2016 and 2017.","In 2015, we affirm Zoetis' reputation as the global leader in the animal health industry with a strong financial performance, continued investment in our future growth and a commitment to creating a value for our customers and shareholders.","For 2015 our diverse portfolio enabled us to grow our revenues by 8% operationally, with particular strength coming from R&D innovations and acquired products from Abbott Animal Health.","In our three years as a public company, we have been delivering consistent operational revenue growth and we expect our 2015 to show again that we are growing faster than the industry. We grew our adjusted net income by 24% operationally, and grew our adjusted EBIT margin from 25% to 28% as we continue our focus on greater efficiency in our business.","Even while we are scrutinizing our efficiency, we also continue to allocate resources for future growth. We invested $1.6 billion in 2015 across strategic acquisitions, internal research and development and capital expenditures in areas like manufacturing and supply. And finally, in 2015 we returned approximately $370 million in excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","This performance reflects our disciplined implementation of our business plan and our colleagues' tremendous dedication to serving our customers. I am pleased to say that as a result we met our guidance for revenue and exceeded our guidance for adjusted net income in 2015.","On a reported basis we had a flat revenue growth due to an 800 basis point impact from foreign currency, but we still grew our reported adjusted net income by 13% thanks to our continued focus on achieving our efficiency goals.","Looking ahead to 2016, first and foremost we are focused on delivering our financial guidance for the year. We are projecting 2% to 4% operational revenue growth, which reflects the impact of our SKU realization and changes to our operations in Venezuela. Excluding those impacts, we expect to grow revenues 8% to 10% operationally with 2 percentage points coming from the addition of PHARMAQ. This means organic growth is expected to be faster than the market again.","And for 2017 we expect to continue growing faster than market at the rate of 5% to 9% as we are confident in our end markets, business model, the prospects for new product launches, improved product supply and progress in our efficiency goals. We are also confident in our pricing strategy. Our prices are defined by the value that we can demonstrate to our customers who buy and pay for the products we completely independent of third-party payers.","In January we updated our adjusted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the impact of the European Commission decision on our tax rate. Today we are pleased to reaffirm our 2016 and 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings per share despite the negative impact of foreign currency and the change in our operations in Venezuela, which will have a negative impact of $0.06 in 2016 and $0.08 in 2017.","Our second objective for 2016 is to ensure the successful launch of new products that are critical for our long-term revenue growth. We are increasing supply for APOQUEL and also launching in new markets. This growth already surpassed $100 million with a limited availability in 2015, and we see significant room to grow from this level with long-term peak sales of more than $300 million.","Another important breakthrough in the area of dermatology, our canine antibody therapy against atopic dermatitis has been introduced in the U.S. to veterinarians and dermatologists, and we are preparing for global market availability later in 2016.","Meanwhile SIMPARICA, a new oral parasiticide, will help us to better compete in the global market of flea and tick products, a market of approximately $3 billion. SIMPARICA was approved in the EU later last year, and we are awaiting approval in the U.S. this quarter. We expect the launch in both the U.S. and EU in the first quarter of 2016, and see sales ramp up during the year.","Our third major objective this year is enhancing the supply and customer service, an area where we fell short last year. As we continue with our supply network strategy, we are making steady improvements, most notably in APOQUEL. We're also investing to build capacity in product categories that will be an important part of our future revenue base.","In the near term we believe that a simplified supply chain with fewer manufacturing plants, focused on expanding the set of products will improve our performance. We also remain on track to complete the global implementation of our new Enterprise Resource Planning system, or ERP, in the first quarter. The ERP will support our overall efficiency goals and will help us better manage the processes and information to run our business. And we continue to refine these systems over the course of the year; we'll make certain we are exceeding our customers' expectations.","Our fourth major objective is around capital allocation and how we maximize our cost structure, investment in R&D and business development. We are making a good progress in shaping our cost structure as part of the overall efficiency plan we announced last May. That work has been accelerated, and the additional cost savings has been included in our guidance.","It is equally important to realize that while we are implementing these plans, we have remained committed to building the three interconnected capabilities that drive our success with customers: U.S. sales, innovative R&D, and high quality and reliable manufacturing and supply. The implementation has been resourced, even as we go through changes in other areas of the company.","Our investment in R&D continues showing high return and support for our future growth. I am very pleased to say that our efforts to refresh our portfolio with innovative vaccines offerings, especially in companion animal are paying off. Last year, we launched a new combination vaccine for dogs across the EU called Versican Plus, and has been very well received by customers.","In the fourth quarter, Zoetis was granted a conditional license from the USDA to market our canine influenza vaccine, the first conditional licensed vaccine to help control disease associated with canine influenza, the virus that is H3N2.","In December, we received our U.S. license for VANGUARD crLyme, a vaccine that aids in the prevention of conditions associated with Lyme disease in dogs. And in November, we expanded our INNOVATOR horse vaccine franchise in the U.S. with the launch of our vaccine to aid in the prevention of leptospirosis.","Meanwhile in aquatic health, shortly after closing our deal with PHARMAQ in the fourth quarter, one of their new vaccines for salmon received an emergency license in Chile, one of the world's largest farmed fish markets.","Our focus on enhancing our portfolio resulted in recent approvals for new indications and formulation of existing products. In January, Zoetis received FDA approval for an update to the labeling for CERENIA, which allow for intravenous administration during the surgical protocols that use medication that induces vomiting.","We launched a new formulation of LUTALYSE, a reproductive product for use in dairy and beef cattle, in the U.S. We are also viewed as a partner of choice, for all innovators in the industry.","In January we enter into an agreement with Anatara Lifesciences, a company in Australia. We'll be evaluating their non-antibiotic, anti-infective product as an alternative to antibiotics that could treat and control infections in farm animals.","And finally, in terms of business development, we'll continue to look for M&A opportunities like we did last year with Abbott Animal Health and PHARMAQ, while we continue with our internal investment in new products, lifecycle innovation and research alliances.","In summary, we delivered an excellent 2015, built in our diverse and market-leading portfolio of products for animal health. We are getting significant traction in the business as we continue reducing complexity, achieving efficiencies, and freeing up resources for our most promising growth opportunities. And we remain well positioned as the industry leader based on our core capabilities and singular focus on animal health.","With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks. Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Let me put an exclamation point on Juan Ram\u00f3n's overview of 2015. What a terrific year we had. If you think back to a year ago, we had a number of very challenging initiatives in front of us, most notably, the design and implementation of the efficiency initiative that we announced in May, and also the rollout of our enterprise-wide SAP system in our most important market, the U.S., as well as many other key locations around the world. I can tell you that both of those projects put enormous pressure on the company, on our colleagues, and in some cases impacted our customers. But we were able to stay on task, overcome many challenges, and deliver results that we're very proud of.","So let's talk about our performance. We had very strong sales growth in the U.S., up 13% for the full year, driven by good livestock sales primarily in cattle, the addition of Abbott Animal Health, and increased supplies of APOQUEL. In the international business we delivered operational sales growth of 4%, which reflected good performance in major markets like Brazil and China, which grew 11% and 17% respectively, partially offset by the business changes that we are making in Venezuela.","We reduced our total operating expenses by 1% on an operational basis in 2015 compared with 2014 while growing revenue 8% operationally. We kicked off our efficiency initiative in May and were able to capture meaningful savings in 2015, particularly in the second half of the year when we reduced our operating expenses by 3% on an operational basis while we were growing revenue 7% operationally.","To be fair, the true test of the operating efficiency improvements that we are making will come over the long term. Anyone can cut costs and improve profits in the short term. The challenge is to improve profits and then grow that larger profit pool at an attractive rate. To do that, you need to be thoughtful about where, how, and how much you reduce costs. We continue to prioritize and spend behind activities that deliver value to our customers and therefore support our growth, namely our sales forces, our R&D engine, and our supply chain, so very good stuff for the full year 2015.","Let me turn to the quarter quickly. You can read the details of our fourth quarter results in the press release and tables, but let me hit on a few highlights, focusing on themes that may be impactful on our future results, starting with revenue. Again, good operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter coming against a very strong quarter in 2014. Next, improvement in operating efficiency; total operating expenses were down 8% operationally in the quarter, and this enabled us to grow adjusted net income by 29% operationally.","Foreign currency continued to be a strong headwind for us as it is for most multi-nationals. Changes in FX rates reduced Q4 reported revenue growth compared with the prior-year quarter by some 900 basis points. There's a word for that; it's brutal.","Setting aside FX, we feel very good about the underlying drivers of our operational; that is, constant currency revenue growth. For the quarter, the 6% operational revenue growth included 3% from increased APOQUEL sales due to better supply, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increases across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Yet these drivers were partially offset by a 3% decline of in-line product revenues. I want to point out that's primarily related to ongoing changes to our business model in Venezuela and other countries like India, which were initiated as part of our efficiency program.","As I said previously, the changes we have made and are making to our business model in certain markets impacted our second half 2015 performance and will have impact on our 2016 revenue growth. But these changes improve our prospects for longer-term revenue and profit growth. That's the prize.","In the case of Venezuela, you'll recall that we are reducing our activities there due to unfavorable economic conditions for multi-national companies. We've been selling down our inventories in the country, limiting our future exports to Venezuela, and this quarter we decided to revalue our assets and liabilities there, based on the free floating SIMADI exchange rate.","In the case of India, we remain committed to our business there, especially in our companion animal and poultry businesses, with a direct field force. However, we are making changes in our approach to the dairy segment. That segment has not consolidated in the way that we had expected over the last several years, and so we are eliminating our dairy field force there and pursuing a distributor partnership to serve those market needs.","It's worth noting that revenue from our other emerging market geography includes Venezuela and India, and declined 3% operationally in the fourth quarter. If you want to go back and you can exclude India and Venezuela, other emerging markets would have grown by 12%. The other emerging markets segment will continue to be an area where we see some noise in 2016, as it includes the countries that will be most significantly impacted by the SKU reductions, as well as market changes that we are undertaking as part of our efficiency programs.","While I'm on the subject of international markets, I know there continues to be general concerns with the outlook for countries like China and Brazil, given lots of recent media reports about their slower GDP growth and their economic outlooks. Generally, demand for animal health products is tied to more stable growth drivers, mainly the demand for animal proteins and the increased adoption and medicalization of pets, both of which move as a function of population, income, and urbanization.","Fundamentals in the animal health segments of both China and Brazil remain strong, and here's the proof. For the full year 2015, we grew revenue in China and Brazil on an operational basis 17% and 11% respectively. In the fourth quarter, China and Brazil grew 14% and 10% respectively. Both markets on a constant currency basis are growing at healthy rates and the growth prospects of these markets remain solid. And so I pose the question rhetorically. Why is that?","For China it's two things. One is the fact that the consumption of animal proteins in China is growing and has continued to grow even in challenging economic times. Second is the goal of the Chinese government to see an improvement in the productivity, safety, and quality of their food supply. That means moving from smaller farms producing animal proteins to a more industrialized model, and that model requires more animal health products to maintain and drive the productivity of the business. Now frankly, as I'm saying this, the second factor should be the first. It's a powerful driver, and it will last for many years.","Now turning to Brazil, Brazil is a very developed livestock market, and domestic consumption of animal protein is only a part of the equation. Brazil is a significant exporter of meat. And so to the extent that the consumption falls within their borders, they have the opportunity to use exports to maintain the health of their livestock businesses. With the weakness of the real, exports are even more attractive today. So counter to what you might conclude when seeing negative headlines about conditions in Brazil, the Brazilian livestock industry and the supporting animal health industry are quite strong.","Using China and Brazil as examples, the key takeaway should be that we operate in an industry that's very resilient. Now I use that word quite a bit, even in times of economic stress, and that applies to developed as well as emerging markets.","Turning to restructuring charges, this quarter we had significant one-time costs that drove a decrease in our reported GAAP net income and earnings per share. Let me explain this quarter's major charges in terms of the three buckets that we use.","First, the standup costs which are mainly associated with our separation from Pfizer totaled $34 million in the quarter. That work will be substantially completed by mid-2016. We recorded $4 million of costs associated with our supply network strategy, and we are still in the early days of that initiative. And we also recorded $52 million of one-time costs associated with our operational efficiency initiative which reflected the acceleration of some of those plans and the associated costs into the fourth quarter of 2015.","And finally, we have taken accounting actions related to the revaluation of our bolivar-denominated assets and liabilities in Venezuela this quarter. We believe it's appropriate to change to the SIMADI rate as our exchange rate for Venezuela. And accordingly, we recorded charges of approximately $93 million in the fourth quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we also announced the sale or exit of five manufacturing sites in the U.S., India and Taiwan, which we expect to generate proceeds in excess of $80 million of cash during 2016.","Turning to guidance, we've provided a bridge in our tables and slides to help show the changes in our guidance for 2016 and 2017, to spotlight the impact of changes in FX rates and changes to our operations in Venezuela. We now expect for the full year 2016 revenue of between $4.65 billion to $4.775 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.30 and $1.48 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $1.71 and $1.81 per share.","For full year 2017, we expect revenue between $4.95 billion and $5.15 billion, reported diluted EPS of between $1.95 and $2.13 per share, and adjusted diluted EPS between $2.18 and $2.32 per share. Our revised guidance reflects the impact of the European Commission's decision on Belgium's tax rulings and the related effect on our earnings, which we disclosed in early January.","Our effective tax rate on adjusted pre-tax income is expected to be approximately 33% in 2016 and 30% in 2017. In January we communicated that the changes to our tax rates reduced our expectations for adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2016 and 2017 by $0.13 and $0.06 per share respectively. Note that we expect to record one-time net tax charges during 2016 of approximately $55 million, of which approximately $35 million to $45 million will be recorded in Q1.","These Q1 charges relate to the nullification of our Belgium tax ruling by the European Commission for the periods from 2013 through 2015. Included in the total $55 million charge is an estimate of a future impact of the revaluation of deferred tax accounts currently associated with our Belgium operation. You can see these $55 million of one-time costs footnoted in our guidance bridge for 2016.","Our revised guidance today also reflects our latest views of our operations in Venezuela, updated FX rates as of the end of January, and other efficiency improvements to offset some of those impacts. Here's some really good news. Other than the impact of the change to our expected tax rate due to the EC ruling, a factor over which we had no control, we're holding our guidance range for adjusted earnings per share for both 2016 and 2017.","We expect the momentum that we carried through Q4 combined with the expected pace and magnitude of the efficiency initiative should enable us to offset the unrelenting headwinds of FX rates and the change to our business model in Venezuela. Yeah, we're proud of that.","And since I have the floor and I like to talk about our company, here's my summary of the year. Looking back at 2015, what you see is another year where the global animal health industry posted solid mid-single-digit growth despite many challenges in many economies around the world. And you saw our company, Zoetis, deliver strong operational growth of revenue, up 8%, by pulling on all of the levers that we have available to us: the best animal health sales forces on the planet, the most productive R&D team in the industry, value-generative M&A, and a supply chain that is a core strength of the company.","And we delivered operational growth of adjusted earnings per share of 24% for the year. And I'm going to repeat that because it's awesome. Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2015 increased 24% on a constant currency basis to $1.77 per share. I call out the $1.77 because while we always measure ourselves on a constant currency basis, at the end of the day we put an actual dollar amount on the tape.","Way back in November of 2014 we put 2015 guidance on the \u2013 excuse me \u2013 2015 guidance on the table. We guided revenue in the range of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.61 to $1.68. Since that time, we, like many multinational companies, have been battered by FX that dramatically reduced our reported revenues. But here's where we're different from many of those other multinationals. Throughout 2015 we held the line on our guidance for adjusted earnings per share and in November of 2015 we actually raised the range to $1.70 to $1.74. And now we report actual results of $1.77 per share.","We're able to do that because we as a management team brought forward a plan in May of last year to improve the efficiency of our cost structure and then we as a team got after it and reduced and controlled expenses to give us the best shot in delivering to you, our shareholders, the best earnings we could under the circumstances. As I love to say, pretty good.","So here's my pitch. The global animal health industry is not just resilient; it has characteristics that point to an extended period of predictable mid-single-digit growth. And the number one company in the global animal health industry is Zoetis. In the three years since we've been public, we've put results on the board that support what we see as our key value drivers.","First, we can grow our revenues at a rate equal to or faster than the mid-single-digit growth rate expected for our industry. Second, we can leverage our expense structure to drive increasing operating margins, delivering profit growth faster than revenue growth. And third, we can intelligently allocate our capital; actively manage our capital structure to grow adjusted earnings per share faster than operating profits.","In today's dystopian financial markets where investors may be looking for shelter from the storm, I think my suggestion would be to look at companies in reverse alphabetical order and start with Z for Zoetis.","That's it for my prepared remarks. Let's get to Q&A. Keith?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. We can take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess, Paul, could you just go back to the contributions from acquisitions in the quarter? I kind of missed those prepared remarks. And then, Juan Ram\u00f3n, I wanted to get an update on SIMPARICA as well. I think in the press release it says you expect approval now in Q1. I think previously you said first half of 2016 so I guess what's the change and what should we expect heading into Western Vet?","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll start, Kevin. Good morning. It's Paul. I'll start with the components of the growth. We had 6% operational revenue growth in the quarter and we recognize the goal was whole percentages here so there's rounding that comes into play but it was 3% from increased APOQUEL sales, 3% from the acquisition of the Abbott Animal Health products, 2% from price increase across the portfolio, and 1% from new products. Then the offset to that was about a 3% decline of what I guess we'll call revenues of all other products. And again, that is primarily related to the change in the business model in Venezuela and countries like India and places that were affected by our efficiency initiative. I hope that answers the question.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Paul. I will take the question on the SIMPARICA. So we submitted to the FDA all the information and based on the normal timing for approval, we expect SIMPARICA to be approved in the U.S. in the first quarter. This all will be depending on final decision of the FDA. Next question, please?","Operator","And our next question comes from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I do see slide 18 in your presentation but I was wondering if you could help us better understand the underlying sales growth for the year without the impact from restructuring and SKU reductions? And then also, do you expect your sales growth to accelerate after these programs are completed? And when might we actually see that? Thanks.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Louise, its Paul. Let me take that, and thank you for asking the question, Louise, because if you just take the headline and say, gee, we're looking at 2% to 4% operational growth in revenue next year, people say, what's up with that? So let's start with from the 2% to 4%, the operational efficiency initiative, the effect on SKUs, and now Venezuela and other markets where we're going to change our model, reduced that by some 600 basis points. You can see that if you look at that slide 18, 600 basis points. So there's 8% to 10% if you're thinking about what our actual expectations are for normalized operational revenue growth in 2016 v. 2015. And if you want to take PHARMAQ out of the equation and go what's the organic portion of that, it's about 200 basis points.","So as you look at that slide, again I'll call everyone's attention to it, we tried our level best to help you think about the strength of 2016 because this is quite a strong year by showing you this waterfall slide. So 2% to 4%, 600 basis points on the efficiency initiative, SKU reductions, Venezuela, India, et cetera, gets you to 8% to 10%, and if you want to look at that on an organic basis it would be 6% to 8% by taking PHARMAQ out of the mix.","Before I concede the floor, I want to say two things before I talk about 2016, because we did change from 3% to 5% operational growth to 2% to 4%. That is predominantly because we had previously articulated that range at the midpoint of our 2015 guidance for revenue. And as you saw, we had strong revenue in Q4, and for 2015 it was about $25 million higher than that. And that accounts for the change from 3% to 5% down to 2% to 4%. We feel really good about what we put on the table in 2015. And as we think about it, we really are excited about 2016, even though it will be masked a little bit by the changes that we are making to our model.","Now last before I concede the floor, you asked the question about what could we expect in 2017. We expect a return to the same kind of solid growth that you would have expected in 2016 but for the change in the efficiency initiative. We're currently forecasting on an operational basis 5% to 9%. That's pretty solid, and that's being driven mainly by new products. Next question, please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, folks. Thank you for all the details on the slides and congratulations on a strong operational performance in 2015. Paul, cost of sales grew at a higher rate than revenues in the quarter, and as a result gross margin was lower year over year and sequentially versus 3Q. I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts there on gross margin.","And just a general question for the both of you, your stock has obviously been underperforming despite this strong operational performance. I'm wondering if you could give us your thoughts on that. And is there an opportunity for a more aggressive share buyback at these levels? Thank you.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, it's Paul. I'll take the Q4 margin. That was predominantly due to FX. Again, I would look at the full year and how we came out, and it was in line with what we were expecting. I know, Alex, we've traveled together a little bit. You look at a quarter; there can be a lot of variability that sneaks into the equation. You compare it against this, that and the other thing. Things happen in a 90-day period that smooth themselves out over the year. I would look at the 65%-odd margin that we put on the board for the full year, and that's indicative of the strength. But the one thing in the fourth quarter was FX. FX is hard to forecast when it flows through cost of sales, but it sure does.","The second thing I think you asked a question about the share price. We're watching our company along with many others lose value, at least in the eyes of shareholders or people who are holding our stock. We continue to do what we can do. We're driving real fundamental value. You posed the question about our share buyback and the scale of that, et cetera. I'd point out that when we were last in the window I guess, which was in the early part of November, the stock was $43 \u2013 $44, I think, and I'm going from memory here, $43 \u2013 $44. And we elected at that point in time to increase the pace of our purchases. As everybody can do the math, we bought about $50 million a quarter through 2015. We're currently buying stock back at a pace of about $75 million a quarter. I know that's not a ton. But as I said also many times, we had a lot of calls on cash in 2016, but even so we elected to increase the pace at which we were wanting to acquire shares. So I hope that answers the questions.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I will add a comment here, Alex. I think that in many cases our company is still associated with the human pharmaceutical industry. And discussions on prices, for instance, have been affecting the human pharmaceutical industry, while this should not be having any impact in our share value. Our prices, as I mentioned in my comments, are completely dependent on third-party payers. We price based on the value that we can demonstrate to our customers, and our customers are not only buying and paying the products they buy from us. So this is something that in my opinion should be also included when different investors or analysts also define the value of Zoetis and also the value of the animal health industry in general.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Next question, please.","Operator","And the next question is from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks for taking my questions. How should we think about the quarterly progression of the U.S. livestock business? And could you characterize the overall health of the U.S. livestock industry just more broadly?","And then one on R&D; on the parasiticide front, should we expect that you're ready to launch as soon as SIMPARICA gets approval in the U.S.? And then with the potential flea, tick, and heartworm combination chewable product, longer term, how long in the pipeline, or how far along in the pipeline is this product? And when should we expect it I guess to launch, and is it in the guidance?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So thank you, Erin, for your question. In terms of the launch of SIMPARICA, we are ready to launch as soon as we get approval from the FDA. We're also ready to launch not only in U.S. but also in the European markets. And the team is ready, the plans are in place, and we have a product to supply to the market.","You also asked a question about the livestock progression in the U.S. And definitely we have seen that in general the livestock has been performing well in 2015. In terms of the quarters, the fourth quarter has been stronger than expected because already in the last year, we reported very strong revenue growth, and in this year also we grew significantly. And in terms of the different areas of livestock, we see also opportunities in cattle, we see opportunities in poultry, and we see opportunities also in swine. We expect also in 2016, the momentum will continue. We see positive trends in the cattle industry, mainly on beef; that we expect that the number of animals will increase by 3% or 3.5%. And this will expect, also will drive additional use of animal health products. And you also asked about...","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The combination product.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The flea and tick and the heartworm. Definitely, our R&D team is working on developing this product and finalizing all the information for submitting all the dossiers to the FDA. We have not yet communicated when we plan to have this product into the market. As we get closer to the finalization of all the different filings, then we'll communicate to the market. And this has not been included in our guidance for 2017. So next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks very much. You mentioned that you had some issues last year with customer service. I think you said mainly around APOQUEL. Can you just expand upon that? Is that issue behind you? How comfortable are you that you will not have any residual issues as we move through 2016?","And then, Paul, maybe just talk a little bit more about longer term, your tax rate thoughts? Do you think 30% is the long term right number to use, or is there an opportunity to maybe push that lower? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we have had supply issues for APOQUEL, and the supply issue has been resolved now. We have now the process for the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient that had been the bottleneck of manufacturing APOQUEL. We have a process which is much more robust and much more consistent. And we are really producing all the product that will be delivered in 2016, and we'll increase significantly the supply to the market. We are also planning to expand APOQUEL to the rest of the world in where the product has been approved, and we plan to do that in 2016. So we are convinced that APOQUEL will deliver significant growth and all the issues that we faced in 2015 will be behind us.","We also reported in 2015 that the implementation of the new ERP also created some issues in terms of deliveries of products into the market. We are very pleased now how the implementation of the ERP has been now performed in the U.S. We have now 90% of our orders delivered the same day, which is a significant achievement, and we are working on improving there, the rest of the functions that also are provided to the customers. We expect that also the ERP, will be supporting our operations in a very efficient way in 2016. And this is something we plan to finalize all implementation of the new system in this quarter, and then moving forward, to maximize the way that we'll be supporting our business.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","John, its Paul. I'll take the tax question. First let me just say we were very disappointed with the European Commission's kind of stating that the Belgium tax rulings like we had are illegal, and essentially nullified our arrangement there. We're disappointed because the Belgians have been very supportive; we've built a terrific operation there. I think I've said in a prior public forum, the Belgians on the contrary, have been one of the more responsible countries with respect to tax policy and how they used it to attract employment and investment into their country and it's a shame.","So set that aside, we're very disappointed. It obviously was not something that we were planning on. And let's pretend that, that didn't happen for a second. We had previously articulated, we thought our tax rate in, call it 2017, would have been on the order of 28%, our adjusted ETR roughly 28%, and now it's 30%. So we lost a couple of hundred basis points there in 2017. But what I would suggest to you is, just as we had articulated with respect to our structure before this happened, we can grind that down, but we wouldn't be grinding it down.","The frustrating thing for us is, we were doing pretty well, fine tuning our global operating model to be efficient and here we have to go back and we have to change course a little bit. So not something \u2013 it was not a happy day for us but we're responding the best way that we can. And I think the way we look at it is we just add 200 basis points higher ETR in 2017 and our job is to grind that down. Next question, please.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Christopher Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Just a couple of here. First, on the 6% impact from the SKU reduction in 2016, I guess now that we're further along in that process, any surprises in terms of customer behavior, in terms of the SKU changes? And I guess is there an opportunity for that number to be lower than 6%, either through uptake of alternatives of those products, or just other initiatives you put in place?","And the second question which is as we're looking out 2016, just any dynamics we should be keeping in mind for modeling this year in terms of quarterly progression? I guess are there any particularly difficult or easy comps that we should be watching as we're kind of thinking about the quarters this year? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris. What we evaluated very carefully when we decided to reduce SKUs on how will be the impact to our customers, we made sure that none of the SKUs that we are eliminating has no alternative to our customers. These alternatives can be from our competitors or can be alternatives, in our portfolio. The 6% impact in our revenues is the net result of reduction and also the assumption that some of these reductions of SKUs will be moved to other SKUs in our portfolio.","In terms of reaction from our customers, I think in some cases, well, they will like to have these products in their portfolio, but they also understand that more important than offering 13,000 SKUs is ensuring that we have a reliable supply. What we want to make sure that when they place an order, they get the order on time to treat or protect the animals. And this is one of the important strategic rationales for our SKU rationalization. It was not only to improve gross margin, but also to ensure that our supply to the market is much more consistent and we can meet all customer submissions. And then Paul will take the question on the phasing in terms of quarters.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think there are two things that I'd be mindful of; one is how the SKU reduction plays out with respect to our revenues. You'll recall that we announced this program in the middle part of 2015, and so we're just starting to see here in Q4 an alignment to Q1 and Q2, the impacts of the SKU rationalization. And it will be relative to the prior year, it will be a significant factor. But we will have to keep our eye on.","The second part is with respect to our cost, our efficiency initiative. We continue to ramp up the amount of savings that we are seeing flow through, and of course the first half of last year we had a modest amount of cost containment or that occurred in the first half, but that steps up and we currently are tracking, as you saw, with an 8% operational reduction in operating expenses in Q4, tracking at a much lower rate, so that will be a very helpful driver on the operating expense side in the first half of the year, and then that benefit, if you will, comparing back to the prior year will moderate over the second half of the year.","I think that's about all we want to cover on phasing. Just lastly, I'll say it again and again and again, we look at our business on a yearly basis. Trying to \u2013 I know you have to and that's what you do and all, and we'll try to be as helpful as we can with respect to the phasing but we run our business on an annual basis. Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Just a couple. First, Paul, maybe you can answer this. On the 2% contribution from price, can you talk about the outlook? How did that look on a global basis U.S. versus outside of the U.S.? And what is the outlook for price increases going forward both in the U.S. and across different geographies.","And then, Juan Ram\u00f3n, just a question for you; as you are now, congratulations, three years as an independent company and it's been very exciting to see how Zoetis has evolved and achieved such tremendous success in a short period of time. Congratulations. But maybe you could just sort of step back and tell us \u2013 when I look at the industry, the animal health industry, it doesn't seem that a whole lot has changed. It still remains highly fragmented. We've seen a little bit of movement with Novartis swapping its business to Lilly. You've made a couple small acquisitions. But by and large, the industry hasn't changed much. Do you see more consolidation going forward? Or do you see some of your peers spinning out their animal health businesses like you have done for yourself? And what does this all mean for your future in terms of M&A? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jami. And I will try to answer both questions. So in terms of the 2%, so the 2%, as you mentioned, it's a global increase. And in terms of where we see this 2% in the different geographies, definitely we have been very consistent in the U.S. with price increases of around 2%. And in the rest of the markets, it depends. So in high inflationary markets, we increased significantly the prices to compensate for inflation and also to compensate for foreign exchange.","In some markets where the economies are \u2013 the inflation is very stable or probably not having any inflation at all, so we are also trying to adjust our prices based on these situations. So in Europe or Japan and some other markets we have been increasing prices but at a lower rate than in the U.S. or some of the markets where we had the opportunity to increase the prices because of inflation.","The second question was related to the consolidation of the industry and the top four or five now animal healthcare companies represent almost 70% of the total market, which has already been increased significantly from some years ago.","Do I see opportunities for further consolidation? I think there are still opportunities, especially on the second tier of companies, after these four or five companies we see opportunities for the consolidation. We expect now the merger of Boehringer Ingelheim and Merial being completed, there's another round of consolidation, and maybe in the future also we'll see some additional consolidation. Definitely the consolidation would be limited because of antitrust issues, but without these antitrust issues or managing these antitrust issues, definitely consolidation can represent a good opportunity for the animal health industry.","The last comment I want to add is that the top 10 companies in animal health represent something like 80% of the total market. On the 20% which is remaining we have maybe hundreds of companies that in -where I expect that this will be a significant consolidation here. And Paul will add some comments in terms of the pricing.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. I mean Jami asked a specific question. I think Jami was trying to get to where is our pricing power. For the full year, emphasis full year, our price added approximately \u2013 a little better than 2% overall but U.S. is about 2% and international was about 3%. Again, a lot of rounding here, but more price increases outside the U.S. than in. Next question, please.","Jami Rubin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","The next question comes from Doug Tsao with Barclays.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe if you could provide a little bit more of an update in terms of how you will sort of increase the availability of APOQUEL, is this what we start now in terms of broadening the number of veterinarians who will have access to the product? Or is it going to be focused more on current \u2013 expanding to new patients? Also, if you can just provide some commentary in terms of the MFA business and how it's faring right now? One of your competitors spoke about some regulatory headwinds in that business and whether you're seeing those as well? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Doug. In terms of the increase for APOQUEL, so let me start saying that we have now two sources of the production of API and the second source that will be a company in Switzerland which is called Siegfried will double the capacity of the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. We plan to now offer APOQUEL to more veterinarians and also to offer more available product to existing veterinarians. At the same time, also the plan is to introduce the product in the rest of the markets where the product was put on hold because of product availability. So we are convinced that during 2016 we'll be able to meet all the demand from the market.","In terms of MFAs, I think MFAs in our case continue growing very strongly and we have the advantage of \u2013 that's right this is the diversity of our portfolio. It's not only diversity in terms of therapeutic areas or in terms of different types of products, but also within the MFAs we have a lot of diversity. And for products that will be maybe facing some challenge because of changes on the approach of the use of antibiotics, and I mentioned in the medical important antibiotics in MFAs with indication of a growth promotion, this will be eliminated but in our portfolio we also have a non-medical important antibiotics in MFAs that can be a good replacement for those that will be eliminated. We have in total in MFAs $500 million in sales and we grew operationally in 2015 by 8%.","So definitely we expect that those are probably the only indication of growth promotion which are medically important for human health that will have an impact in the revenues but this impact will be minimum. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Mark J. Schoenebaum - Evercore ISI","Hey, Paul. My email went up during your prepared remarks. I just wanted to say that it was really a brutally awesome prepared remarks section, especially the part about how we should reverse the alphabet, I love that. That's a great idea. But in all seriousness, I had a bunch of questions, but I'll limit it to 1.5 because most people have been doing it. Number one, given all the opacity that \u2013 you guys have tried to do everything you can to make it clear but this the confusion, I guess, that FX potentially creates, why not synthetically hedge against the effects on that at least in that net income line especially after the turmoil this year, although you guys have done a great job helping us understand the effect.","And then number two, maybe I missed this, but I didn't hear you break out APOQUEL sales on 4Q. I was wondering if you could. I apologize if I just missed it, if you could break those out in the U.S. and also the rest of world. And if you already answered that one, then my question would be the 6% to 8% normalized organic operational growth, what are the components of that for 2016 that you see? Thanks.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll start with the FX. I think when you're looking at trying to hedge operations around the world against foreign currencies, you have two choices. You can either, in non-technical terms, let it fly, which is what we do with respect to operations like many, many other multinational companies do, or you can attempt to hedge. If you hedge, you hedge within a quarter, and the analysis that we've done has suggested that you're essentially chasing down. You limit the cost of the hedges, ultimately make it like a less than fruitful exercise. Now others will tell you that they can do it, and that's okay. That would be their point of view. I point out that a couple of the currencies that tend to be the most volatile, there are not markets for us to go out and hedge. I think they're not deep enough. They're not efficient enough. And so you wouldn't be able to fully offset that.","I think I love your word there, opacity. I might have mispronounced that. We're trying our best to let the market follow along with as much of the information that we have that we can share with you so you can decide how we're performing. We do now, and we will continue to manage ourselves on an operational basis, meaning a constant currency basis. And I will hope against hope perhaps that at some point in the future here we'll see some more stability in the foreign exchange rates, and that we'll enjoy the positive upside, not from an operational perspective, but from a reported perspective of currency, FX rates going in the opposite direction.","Juan, do you want to take the APOQUEL sales, or would you like me to?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The APOQUEL sales, I think we had more than $100 million in 2015. It's about $110 million. This was below initial expectations. And the only reason for that was that ensuring that we have enough product to supply to customers, and not increasing the number of customers having access until we have the certainty that the product would be available. Now we're having a situation that we increase significantly the production, and we'll be able to increase the deliveries to our customers. Globally in international markets, I think we had about $40 million, and then the rest was in the U.S. But it's important to understand that in international markets it was very limited number of countries where we have the product available in the market.","You also asked about components of our organic growth, 6% to 8%, and Paul will provide the details of this.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll start. First of all, we expect to continue to be able to take consistent price across our portfolio. That's a driver. Second is there's a significant impact from new products in 2016, which frankly will be an even bigger impact on 2017, and then just performance of our portfolio. When I say new products, I'm focusing on the ones that you can see that make a difference. I'd point out that we have lots of new products that we don't talk about necessarily individually and maybe individually don't move the needle, but in the aggregate they sure do. 6% to 8% normalized operational growth in revenue next year would be terrific, and then again going into 2017 new products help even more.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Mark, let me correct the total revenue that we generated internationally. Internationally was $20 million and then the rest was in the U.S. And I want to insist that in the international markets we have very limited number of markets and also limited supply. So the potential in both U.S. and international is much higher. So next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks very much. My questions are financial. Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground on the business and the outlook. So, Paul, two questions. First, could you please discuss the outlook for 2016 cash flow, including cash flow from operations and then planned uses of cash? And then second, if you could, just comment on the quarterly progression throughout the year, just to make sure that we set up our models appropriately and we understand the different variables to consider. Thanks very much.","Paul S. Herendeen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, I'll start with the discussion around expected cash flow. Recall that we try to call them out each and every quarter. We have a large amount of expenses that we're incurring with respect to: one, the standup from Pfizer; second, the operational efficiency initiative; and now we add to the list a potential true-up of our international taxes in light of the EC's comments.","If you look at our guidance tables, we call out the amount or the expected amount of the acquisition costs that we expect to incur in 2016 and then again in 2017. Those are I would call them \u2013 they're not normal and they will go away, and most of them will go away towards the latter part of 2016. But in 2016 it's a fairly significant call on our cash.","Secondarily, we continue to be in a phase of investing in our supply chain. We continue to invest capital there, so our CapEx is tracking at a rate that exceeds our ongoing depreciation rate, so net-net we continue to invest there. Of course, we called out that we now have a program that everybody can do the math, where at least the current expectation is we're purchasing shares at the rate of $75 million a quarter. It's $300 million this year plus our dividend. You can do that math. And those are other than our earnings are the things that you need to take into consideration when thinking about our cash flow.","I don't want to stop without speaking about efficiency of working capital. That is something that is to come. It's not something that you would see necessarily in 2015 and not in an enormous way in 2016. By the end of this quarter, we expect to have our ERP system up and running in all of our locations around the world, which is going to give us the ability to then implement tools, to much better manage primarily our investment in our inventories. Our receivables, I think we do a pretty good job there, and we certainly do the same things as everyone else with respect to payables. But we will not start to see some maybe significant cash flow from the improvement in cost of working capital really until 2017.","I wasn't specific there, David. I wasn't specific for the reason we don't want to provide specific guidance with respect to free cash flow, but I believe we've provided each of the components that will enable you to look out to 2016, 2017, and then beyond. I think when you get out into the latter part of this decade, our depreciation should start to normalize at a level close to our depreciation amount. I'll stop there.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You also asked about the quarterly progression for 2016. Let me provide a couple of comments here. So first we expect that the new product launches will have no impact in the first quarter and we expect that these products ramping up during the year. Also APOQUEL, we expect that the biggest impact we'll see from the second quarter of 2016 as we also extend the product availability in the markets where the product has been already introduced, and we also launch in new markets.","In terms of expenses of course, also our efficiency program, will have much more impact in the second half than in the first half, because in the second half, we plan really to complete most of the actions that we took as part of the announcements that we made in May, and this also will have a positive impact in our results in the second half of the year. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company.","Kathy M. Miner - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, good morning. Two questions, one first on PHARMAQ. When you acquired the company, you had stated that it was growing about 17%. Is that still a good estimate going forward, or could it be higher given their late stage pipeline that you talked about? And also do you continue to expect it to be neutral to EPS this year and then accretive thereafter, or could that accelerate?","And the second question just has to do on trends outside of the U.S. in livestock. We saw the issue in France last year where they changed the legislation on antibiotics. Are there any other areas that we should look for in 2016 where there may be similar changes? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So Thank you, Kathy, for the questions. In PHARMAQ, what we communicated is that we plan to generate that revenue for $100 million in 2016 and $125 million in 2017 and at the end of the year PHARMAQ reported revenues of close to $80 million, so we see a significant increase in terms of our revenues.","What we saw during the due diligence when we acquire in terms of the pipeline, it's performing now with the launch of the product in Chile that it was under this emergency license. And we will continue progressing in the plans that we have for PHARMAQ. So we are very excited about the opportunities of PHARMAQ. We are working also in terms of integrating the two companies, but ensuring that PHARMAQ remains a leader in aquatic health with enough identity to maximize the relationship with the customers that they already built through many years.","In terms of the comments that you made, in France, definitely in 2015 we saw an impact because of the change of the legislation in France. This was affecting antibiotics. We expect also that antibiotics will continue having discussions and restrictions in some of the markets. This has been incorporated in our guidance for 2016 and 2017. And we also think that the projections that external sources are making about the total animal health industry and also the growth in antibiotics are consistent with what with our projections. So the industry will be growing about 5%. Antibiotics is expected to grow at half of this rate. The advantage for Zoetis is that it will have in our portfolio, antibiotics which are injectables, which are considered as premium antibiotics that are kept by veterinarians as a resource to ensure that they are treating and in some cases protecting also animals against infections.","So we are confident that the impact that it will have in antibiotics will be lower in our revenue, but in any case all these elements have been incorporated in our projections. Next question, please.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Jeff, if you want to check your mute button please?","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Can you hear me now?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, we can.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. Good morning. I just want to ask a couple of questions around Sanofi and Boehringer. First off, if you expect that business combination or that potential business combination to have any impact on the competitive environment for you as you go forward into 2017 and beyond, any specific areas of concern or opportunity there? And then second, just as you got two European companies coming together there. You've talked very briefly in the past about potential inversions, lack of opportunities, that's potentially two less opportunities now. Just any updated thoughts there is that's really looking beyond you now to potentially look at any kind of inversions or spin-versions out there. Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Jeff, for the question and definitely the Sanofi\/BI merger will create a very strong competitor. It will be the second largest animal health company in our industry. But we don't think that the combination of the two companies will create additional competitive challenge to Zoetis. We have the scale, we have the diversity, and we have the business model that has been proven very successful in the past and will continue also being successful in the future. The productivity that we have in R&D is also showing very high levels. So we are confident that we'll continue growing in line, or faster than market. So we are projecting in fact in 2016 and 2017 we're growing faster than market despite of Sanofi\/BI or despite of all these additional consolidations in our industry.","Sanofi and BI, they are two European companies that potentially can be, maybe an opportunity for tax inversion, but also creating significant anti-trust issues to Zoetis. So we continue assessing opportunities that, to further consolidate, not with the only objective of saving on tax, but a combination of synergies that we can generate in terms of revenue, in terms of costs, opportunities on reducing our effective tax rate, and definitely creating a value to the company. Next question, please.","Operator","Next we'll go for a follow-up with Kevin Ellich with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin K. Ellich - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. I was just wondering if you could comment about the, I guess Juan Ram\u00f3n, did you say you guys have \u2013 supply of SIMPARICA is ready for launch? I just wanted to make sure I had that right.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I said that SIMPARICA product is ready for launch and as soon as we have approval for FDA, we'll be launching that in the U.S. and also in Europe. So we have the product in our warehouses.","Operator","And it does appear we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, for closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you very much. And thank you for joining us today. As we continue through 2016, we are determined to make the most of our business model, our interconnected capabilities and the fundamental drivers of growth in animal health. We'll complete our operational changes, becoming less complex, more efficient and more agile. And we'll invest in growth opportunities to strengthen our business. I am confident that these steps will help improve our margins, better serve our customers and build shareholder value over the long term.

Good morning and welcome to the Zoetis second quarter 2016 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Paul Herendeen, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projections.","For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release and our SEC filings, including, but not limited to, our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or U.S. GAAP.

Our performance this quarter once again demonstrates why we have confidence in the consistency and the predictability of our results and why we are the leader in the animal health industry.","True to our diverse business model, we continue generating result from many different sources, both in the U.S. and international markets and across different species and therapeutic areas; and our portfolio help us deliver steady results over the long-term despite some economic and market challenges that exist.","Our R&D investment is maintaining a high level of productivity with new products like SIMPARICA as well as lifecycle innovation and market expansions for key product lines such as DRAXXIN, VANGUARD and VERSICAN Plus. We also combine this internal investment with external partnerships and opportunities with products like SILEO, the new noise aversion medicine we are marketing for dogs in the U.S.","In addition to sales and innovation, we are demonstrating our leadership in the animal health industry with the profitability and performance of our operations. We have been executing on the operational efficiency program we announced last year; and we are on track to deliver more than $300 million dollars in savings and an adjusted EBIT margin of 34% by the end of 2017. We believe this achievement in efficiency and profitability is unparallel in the animal health industry.","Looking more closely at our second quarter results, operational revenue was up 6%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As you will recall, this year our revenue growth and focus will continue to reflect the impact from changes related to the operational efficiency program we put in place in 2015. Those SKU rationalization and business changes in countries like Venezuela and India continue to partially offset more significant gains in our core business.","Excluding these impacts and the impacts of acquisitions, our normalized organic operational growth will be 9%; and on the same basis, our companion animal products grew 15% and our livestock products grew 5%. Paul will provide more details on the bridge from reported to normalized organic operational growth in his remarks.","The growth in companion animal was based on the strong performance by APOQUEL, as well as our recently launched vaccines and SIMPARICA. In livestock, we saw growth coming from a recovery of cattle business in the U.S. In swine, the positive performance from the International segment was offset by a decline in the U.S. And in poultry, we declined globally due to market conditions and pressure from competition.","We are improving our cost of sales and gross margin as we refine our manufacturing network, execute our efficiency plan and focus on continuous improvement. On an operational basis, our adjusted operating expenses were flat in the second quarter, even as we grew revenues significantly; thanks to the ownership and mindset of our colleagues and expense management discipline.","The growth in revenues, gross margin improvement and discipline on expenses resulted in adjusted net income growth of 22% operationally; once again, supporting our long-term and value proposition to grow adjusted net income faster than revenue.","We always emphasize a full year view of our business to account for some of the seasonal fluctuation and timing patterns in animal health; and we continue to see good progress through that lens. We're increasing our guidance for 2016 based on our strong performance in the first half of the year, the continued strength of our business model and the confidence in our outlook for the rest of the year. Paul will go through updated to 2016 guidance in his remarks.","Now let me turn to the innovation investment that are fueling our performance this year and positioning us well for the future value creation. At the beginning of the year, I said we needed to execute flawlessly on our new product launches; and I'm very pleased with our progress.","In the case of APOQUEL, it has become a very positive story. For the first half of 2016, we have exceeded $100 million in revenue; until May, we have been supplying APOQUEL with no restrictions. Recently, we have launched in additional markets such as Brazil, Japan, Mexico and Russia; and in the coming months, we plan to introduce APOQUEL in the rest of the approved markets such as Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, as well as Singapore and Hong Kong.","SIMPARICA, our new oral parasiticide for dogs is now available to customers in U.S. and most of the European countries; and we expect it to be further deployed in Canada, Brazil and New Zealand during 2016.","We are pleased with the launch of SIMPARICA, despite being the most recent entrant in a very competitive oral flea and tick market for dogs. At launch, SIMPARICA was introduced with extensive published data, showing its rapid onset of action, its sustained persistence of protection against fleas and ticks and other advantages over various oral and topical parasiticides on the market.","While new products have been a big lift for us recently, we continue to build on our major established product lines and focus on the lifecycle innovation that will keep our portfolio strong and sustainable. One of the strengths of our R&D organization is ability to innovate across the phases of care that veterinarians encounter; phases that includes prediction, prevention and treatment.","Our R&D begins with an understanding of the biology of the diseases, their pathways and how they work. Then, we complement that with customer insights that come from our commercial teams working shoulder to shoulder with veterinarians and producers; and we apply this knowledge across the phases of healthcare.","We use innovations in genetics, diagnostics and increasingly digital platforms to help predict risks or detect diseases in species. This means the ability to breed healthier and more productive animals, to detect disease earlier and to develop practices informed by bioinformatics and digital applications that capitalize on the use of big data.","In the second quarter, for example, we continue to expand our business diagnostic franchise into new markets with an additional approval in Spain for livestock test kits. These point-of-care test kits deliver accurate, fast and clear results that give the customers timely and informed diagnosis without disrupting their clinical consultation.","Our customers are also seeking for new solutions to get ahead and help prevent infectious diseases. We have been placing a greater emphasis on our vaccine portfolio, some of which we introduced last year and others that we continue to expand in terms of approvals and geographies.","For example, in the second quarter, we expanded our VERSICAN Plus and the VANGUARD vaccine franchises with new approvals in Europe and Canada. VERSICAN Plus, a combination of vaccines that protect dogs against 10 canine diseases was first approved in European Union in 2014; and this quarter, we received additional approvals in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands for a smaller combination of the vaccine. Additionally, VERSICAN Plus Rabies achieved approval for a new claim in European Union three years duration of immunity.","Meanwhile VANGUARD B Oral and VANGUARD crLyme vaccines were approved in Canada after having just received their U.S. approval in December 2015. And finally, across the phases of healthcare, we develop medicines to treat sick animals. DRAXXIN, one of the Zoetis' largest global product lines and was first introduced in 2015 (sic) [2005]; and this quarter, we received approval of a new label claim in Europe for DRAXXIN and DRAXXIN 25, an injectable anti-infective for treating swine respiratory disease.","In addition to our internal R&D, we also look for partners that can help broaden and strengthen our product portfolio. For example, in May, Zoetis launched in the U.S. a product called SILEO under an exclusive agreement with Orion Corporation. SILEO is the first and only medication approved by the FDA for treatment of noise aversion in dogs. And if you were in the U.S. this July 4, you probably read about or heard about this exciting new product that brought hope to many dog owners.","In summary, we have continued our positive momentum through the first half of the year based on the strength of our U.S. portfolio and dedicated Zoetis colleagues. We continue to reap the benefits of a productive, world-class R&D organization focused on new products and lifecycle innovation across our approximately 300 products lines. And we are executing on key product launches and our operational efficiency program to ensure our long-term growth and value creation.","With that, let me turn things over to Paul. Paul?","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n. Another solid quarter with lots of good things to cover, so let's get to it, starting with a quick walk down the P&L for the quarter. Then, I'll provide some commentary on a number of areas that I believe will be helpful to understanding our quarter, our first half of 2016 and what you might expect for the balance of 2016.","Before I start, I want to point out that the SKU rationalization and the changes in business models we made in several international countries continue to have an impact on our revenue in 2016 and growth in revenue for 2016 compared with 2015.","First, we're confident that the steps that we took and are taking to improve efficiency will put Zoetis in a position to deliver higher profits and cash flows and to better grow those profits and cash flows from here forward. Second, while we're going through this transition, we believe it's important that we and you have visibility into how to the go-forward portion of our business is performing. So we prepared analyses that strictly eliminated SKUs out of our revenue to show the underlying growth of the go-forward business.","On our website, you'll see slides and you'll find a table \u2013 or tables rather that show our reported revenue growth for the second quarter and for the first half of 2016; and then walk you through the impacts of foreign currency, the operational efficiency changes related to SKUs and other business model changes, recent M&A; and in the case of the year-to-date charts, the extra days in our first quarter relative to the prior year.","The objective here is not to divert attention from the reported revenue growth rates; it's to provide perspective on how you might think about our future growth prospect in our to-be state. While we use the phrase operational growth, that means excluding the impact of changes in FX rate versus the same period in the prior year; when we say normalized organic growth for any period compared with the prior year period, that means excluding the impact of FX, the eliminated SKUs, the business changes outside the U.S., the extra days in the first quarter of the year and the impact of recent M&A. So with that lengthy preamble, let's talk about the quarter.","Revenue grew 6% on an operational or constant currency basis. We posted an adjusted gross margin of 67.9% in the quarter, resulting in adjusted gross profit growing faster than revenue; up 11% on an operational basis. Adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis, reflecting the great progress we've made on our efficiency initiative.","As Juan Ram\u00f3n said, we're on track to deliver more than the previously announced $300 million in savings associated with the efficiency initiative; and those savings are considered in our guidance for 2017. The combination of 11% operational growth of adjusted gross profit and the flat adjusted operating expenses enabled us to grow adjusted EBIT for the quarter by 25% on an operational basis.","Below the operating line, we had higher interest expense and higher effective tax rate on adjusted income, which together reduced the operational growth rate of adjusted net income to 22%. We put adjusted earnings per share of $0.49 on the board for the quarter. And the strong performance in the first half of the year enabled us to increase our guidance for the full year 2016 by 3% \u2013 excuse me, $0.03 per share across the range; a solid quarter and a solid first half of the year for sure.","So a bit deeper dive on revenue. The star of the quarter geographically was the U.S., up 10%, and by global business it was companion animal, up 13%; and both of those are on an operational basis. Of course, APOQUEL was an important driver of both. APOQUEL sales in the quarter were roughly $60 million. APOQUEL has a lot of revenue growth still ahead. And with SIMPARICA and a number of other recently introduced companion animal products, we expect our companion animal business to drive above market revenue growth through 2017.","Our International segment was up 2% operationally, and the global livestock business grew about 1% operationally. Both were disproportionately impacted by our SKU reductions and the changes we made to our operating models in countries, including Venezuela and India. On the flipside, global livestock is benefiting from M&A, mostly PHARMAQ.","Now let's talk about the components of our operational revenue growth of 6% in the quarter. APOQUEL accounted for 3% of that growth. New products other than APOQUEL, including our new companion animal vaccines, SIMPARICA, SYNOVEX ONE and SILEO, to name a few, added 2%.","In-line products added 4%, with 3% coming from increased prices and 1% for volume; and M&A accounted for another 2%. The impact of the SKU reductions and the changes in business models reduced our growth by some 500 basis points; and that gets you to the 6% operational revenue growth for the quarter. Pretty good, right? Once again, our revenue growth came from a number of sources and reflects the strength of our diverse business model.","Let's turn to our two segments, U.S. and International, starting with the U.S. Overall, the U.S. business was up 10% in the quarter. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. grew 11% in the quarter. U.S. companion animal business was up 17% mainly due to the ramp of APOQUEL, the launch of SIMPARICA and the introduction of other new products. Half of the growth was driven by the ramp of APOQUEL.","U.S. livestock grew 2% with a 4% pick up from increased selling prices that were offset in part by volume decreases related to some of the SKU reductions. On a normalized organic basis, the U.S. livestock business delivered growth of 5%, compared to a 9% decline in Q1 of this year. The business rebounded nicely in Q2 and the year-to-date normalized organic growth rate for the U.S. livestock business was negative 3%.","After the first quarter, there was some concern out there about the health of our U.S. livestock business. For the avoidance of doubt, after a slow start, we expect our U.S. livestock business to deliver growth for the full year 2016 on a normalized organic basis. Within U.S. livestock, cattle, especially beef cattle, was particularly strong as the herd size and placements in feedlots were increasing and drove higher demand for our high-value injectable anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides and the recently launched SYNOVEX ONE implants.","U.S. swine products experienced a decline due to competition for Fostera PCV vaccines, new restrictions on the use of some of our products for pork exports to China, a decline of PEDv revenue as the disease is no longer prevalent and some eliminated SKUs.","U.S. poultry revenue declined in the quarter with the impact of SKU rationalization more than offsetting growth from the increased use of our health maintenance products and MFAs for antibiotic flea production; products like Zoamix, for example.","On to the International segment, revenue from our International segment was up 2% operationally. On a normalized organic basis, the growth rate was 7%. On the same normalized organic basis, the international companion animal business led the way, up 10%, while international livestock was up 5% in the quarter; again, both of those are on a normalized organic basis.","It's worth spotlighting a few countries for you. China was up $14 million or 49% operationally. Pork prices in China were relatively high leading to favorable conditions for pork producers and for our swine portfolio, including products like DRAXXIN, EXCEDE and our vaccines. About one-third of the growth in China was driven by products purchased by producers to stock up ahead of label changes for some of our products. Finally, we had a very successful spring promotion that drove increased sales of our REVOLUTION and DECTOMAX products in China.","In Brazil, cattle and companion animal sales were strong, but partially offset by a weakness in poultry. The cattle portion of livestock in Brazil enjoyed favorable market conditions, leading to strong performance from our vaccines and parasiticides. We also saw increased adoption of IMPROVAC in the swine business.","Across the portfolio, we also benefited from increased selling prices. The poultry business saw high input prices and increased restrictions on exportation to Japan that made for a challenging market for poultry producers and saw us lose a few accounts based on price. For the quarter, Brazil grew 6% operationally.","Australia posted a solid 10% operational growth for the quarter, led by the launch of APOQUEL, the success of a promotional campaign for REVOLUTION and sales of anti-infectives for cattle.","On the negative side of the growth ledger, in the UK, we saw our sales decline 21% operationally. The biggest factor, nearly half the decline was due to weather. A wet winter to spring delayed the cattle sheep turnout seasons; and that was a factor. The second quarter was also negatively impacted as we were in the process of shifting the acquired Abbott products to our distribution and we saw the channel accelerate purchases into Q1 and work off the inventory in Q2. Year-to-date, the UK business is up 3% operationally.","Finally, the grouping in other emerging countries declined 5% operationally with the biggest drags being Venezuela and the SKU reductions. We saw growth across most of the countries in this grouping, including through the addition of PHARMAQ revenue in Chile.","So on revenue, high level, the beat goes on. Growth from many sources in a diversified model that enables us to overcome softness in parts of our business with strength in other areas.","Now let's shift to the rest of the P&L. We posted a high gross margin, 67.9% in the second quarter. But before we all start high-fiving each other, let's look at the factors that led to the 250 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. Of the improvement, roughly a third came from price increases; a third from a mix shift toward the high-margin companion animal products; and a third came from other areas, mostly improvements in our supply chain efficiency. These three net positives experienced a bit of a headwind due to unfavorable foreign currency.","Our gross margin has been improving, but it's not a one-way ratchet and there are some seasonal elements that we expect to come into play in the second half of 2016. For example, sales of our livestock products are greater as a percentage of total revenue in the second half of the year; and pricing promotions heading into the fall can lessen our net selling prices and thereby reduce gross margins in the period.","These factors are expected to result in our reporting lower gross margins in the second half of the year as compared with the first half. And finally, there's, of course, FX. Predicting the timing and magnitude of FX changes on the cost of goods sold and on gross margin in short periods is very difficult. So that's a lot of discussion designed to caution you about assuming that our guidance for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue for 2016 and 2017 are conservative.","There's good news here. We fully expect our gross margin to continue to improve over time based on increased selling prices, increased sales from our companion animal products versus livestock and increased efficiency on our supply chain. But the upward journey will not be linear quarter to quarter.","Turning to adjusted operating expenses. There is really not a lot to say except that we're on track to take out more than our target of $300 million of operating cost by year-end, so we enter 2017 in our new leaned out state. Total adjusted operating expenses were flat on an operational basis when compared to Q2 of 2015.","Note that our operating expense base is not static. We've added costs, selling, marketing and R&D to the base via the PHARMAQ acquisition and to support the launch of SIMPARICA and we may consider investing in promotion of certain key products or incremental R&D. The purpose of the efficiency initiative was to eliminate non-productive expenditures, not to ignore high-value investments we can make in our business.","At this stage, our to-be operating expense structure is what you see in our 2017 guidance table. We continue to demonstrate excellent expense discipline through the second quarter, and that combined with the gross margin improvement enabled us to post operational growth of adjusted EBIT of 25% for the quarter.","Below the operating line, we had increased interest expense due to the note issuance in Q4 that funded the PHARMAQ acquisition and pre-funded the $400 billion of debt that matured in the first quarter of the year. And our effective tax rate on adjusted income increased by some 100 basis points, mostly due to the change in our tax status in Belgium.","Bottom line, our adjusted net income grew operationally 22% and our adjusted earnings per share grew 23% operationally, about 100 basis points faster than adjusted net income, as our fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding in Q2 2016 were almost 1% less than in Q2 of 2015.","Couple of additional factors, I think, that you need to think about for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. First, as always, FX. While there has been a bit of volatility in FX rates recently, notably with the British pound and the euro, the FX impact on the balance of our year and into 2017 is little changed from our last guidance update.","The overall impact on our future expectations for our International operations, based on FX rates, in late July are negligible. That said, FX rates had a negative impact on our reported revenue and profit rates, decreasing revenue growth in Q2 by some 300 basis points compared with Q2 of 2015 and adjusted net income growth by some 800 basis points. Contrast that with a 700-basis-point drag on reported revenue growth in Q1 and a 1,300-basis-point drag on adjusted net income in Q1.","So as we had hoped on the last call, the impact of FX rates on our reported growth is moderating. Regardless, we continue to measure ourselves on a constant currency or operational basis.","Next, the SKU reductions, including the changes we made to our business models in places like Venezuela and India. As we communicated on our last call, we expect the SKU reductions and business changes to decrease revenue growth by some 500 basis points for the full year 2016. In Q1, the impact was roughly 400 basis points; in Q2, it was roughly 500 basis points; and year-to-date, it was roughly 500 basis points. I'll point out, there's a little bit of rounding in there.","You can see the impact of the SKU reductions in business model changes on the revenue growth in the charts that are on our website that I mentioned earlier; and I call your attention to those. I think they're helpful.","On to one-time costs, I won't use this time to walk through the table in the press release, but want to call your attention to a contra expense item from the reversal of a portion of our severance accrual. At the time we recorded the accrual, we based it on the best information available. As it's worked out, we expect to pay out a little bit less in severance than we had thought, mainly due to a greater level of voluntary attrition than expected. From a cash out the door perspective that's a good thing for us.","For the avoidance of doubt, the reversal did not increase our adjusted net income, but it did increase our reported GAAP net income in the quarter and was a factor in narrowing the gap between adjusted earnings and Generally Accepted Accounting Principle earnings.","Finally, on to guidance. Today, we're updating our guidance for the full year of 2016 for a couple of things. We've increased our revenue guidance range by $25 million to reflect the strength of our business and our improved visibility now that we're through the first half of 2016. And we moved our expectations for adjusted cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue from a range of 33% to 34%, to approximately 33%, so the favorable end of the range.","Adjusted EBIT projections have improved in a similar fashion, so that's been updated too. We also updated our one-time costs to reflect the lower expectations for the severance point I just talked about. All other categories remain the same and the result is that we've raised our guidance range for 2016 adjusted earnings per share by $0.03 to the range of $1.86 to $1.93 per share. Note that the operational growth rate for adjusted net income implied by our guidance increased by 100 basis points and is now a range of 10% to 14%. The majority of the increase in our guidance is operational, not FX-related.","Now, we can all do the math into what our guidance implies for the second half of the year for adjusted net income per share and you may think that that outlook is anomalous, given the second half revenue is expected to exceed revenue in the first half of the year. Here are a couple of observations about the phasing of our business in 2016.","First, we do expect second half revenues to exceed the first half, that's a good start. However, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to generate lower gross margins in the second half of the year than seen in the first half due to mix and promotional programs reducing net selling prices and, therefore, gross margins.","Next, our major promotional spending and operating expenses in support of our various product franchises are more weighted to the back half of the year. And finally, our R&D spending also skews to the second half of the year. Generally, the benefits of the increased sales expected in the second half of the year compared with the first may be more than offset by reduced gross margins, and the phasing of spending on promotional programs and R&D.","So you all know I don't like to talk about quarters, but here are a couple of tips for phasing Q3 and Q4 2016. We expect Q4 to be our highest revenue quarter. We expect gross margins in the second half to be below those in Q1 and Q2. Selling expenses are expected to be heavier in the second half of the year, particularly heavy in Q4; and R&D spending in the second half is expected to be higher than the first half and heaviest in Q4.","From adjusted net income perspective, Q3 may be the low quarter for the year. What's the most important is that we raised our full year 2016 guidance at revenue by $25 million and at adjusted earnings per share by $0.03. This is all good stuff. Our guidance for 2017 is unchanged. We expect a more detailed look at 2017 at the time we report our third quarter.","That's it from me. Keith, let's go ahead and queue up the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will take our first question from Louise Chen with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us more color on why you think livestock sales should continue to improve in second half 2016, especially since some of your competitors posted disappointing livestock sales this quarter? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, livestock is a combination of many species. Let's start with cattle and let's start with cattle in the U.S. Cattle in the U.S. have two different segments, beef and dairy. In beef, we have seen that the number of animals, it's larger than the previous year by 3%. In the second quarter also we saw that the number of placement in the feedlot increased by 5%. On the total year, we expect that the number of animals will be about 3% higher than 2015; and also the placement on the feedlot during the second half will be lower than in the second quarter we expect also to grow by about 3%.","With all this, we expect that the cattle business for beef in the U.S. will be positive. We have seen also improvement in Australia because of the weather conditions. We have seen also that the fundamentals of the Brazilian remains very strong with even increasing exportations. So in our opinion, the cattle business for beef will be positive for the year.","Dairy, prices are having a negative impact in the profitability of farmers around the world. In the U.S., we expect that the business will not be \u2013 or revenues coming from dairy will not be a significant driver of growth; although we have seen also that so far farmers are not reducing the number of animals, so which is also a good indication that they also expect improvement in pricing in the second half or first half of 2017.","Swine, and for us as we said, in the international business is doing extremely well. We expect this trend to continue in the second half. In the U.S., we are facing some competitive challenge that we also expect to start solving in the fourth (sic) [fourth quarter 2016] and first quarter of 2017. And poultry is the area in where we expect probably less positive evolution for our portfolio. But, in general, we expect that livestock at the end of the year will be showing a positive growth.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Juan Ram\u00f3n, can you talk about longer term goals that you've got for SIMPARICA and SILEO? How do you think those products over time will end up sizing compared to APOQUEL? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, we expect SIMPARICA being a key product in our portfolio. And we think that SIMPARICA and SIMPARICA also as a platform for adding new products into the parasiticide franchise will be an important product. We mentioned that we expect this product to generate more than $100 million. Based on the current trends of the market switching more into oral and moving away from topicals will represent a higher opportunity for SIMPARICA.","For SIMPARICA, we also are implementing our approach in lifecycle innovation from the very beginning. So we expect also to increase or to improve the label of SIMPARICA very soon with new ticks and also new indications and using SIMPARICA as a platform to combine the active ingredient of SIMPARICA with other active ingredients that will extend the protection of dogs for any type of parasiticide. We will be also working on how to use SIMPARICA active ingredient also to develop products for cats. So, overall, we consider that SIMPARICA as a platform will be a very strong product in our portfolio.","SILEO, it's a product that \u2013 it's showing that why we are the product of choice in the animal health industry. It's also combining our internal effort with external collaborations. We obtained the license from SILEO from Orion Corporation for the U.S. And SILEO got very good support in terms of communication at the time of the launch. And it will not be a large product in our portfolio, but it's adding solutions to our customers and definitely it's increasing the relevance of Zoetis in terms of providing any type of needs to our customers.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great, guys. Maybe I can slip in two quick ones. SIMPARICA, you just mentioned the label expansion. What about plans for a DTC similar to what we've seen from some of the competitive offerings. And then if so, on the DTC, Paul, is that embedded into some of that promotion expenses that you mentioned in the back half of the year?","And then also, if I can just ask one on APOQUEL. I think you threw out $60 million versus $50 million last quarter. What do you feel like inventory looks like in the channel, people who were sort of trying to horde or stockpile that in the early days? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Let me start with SIMPARICA and then I will ask Paul to answer on the APOQUEL question. So definitely we see SIMPARICA as a strong candidate for DTC promotion. But we also we want to make sure that the product has enough penetration in the market to benefit for this type of investment. And we'll consider this opportunity when we have the product well established in the U.S. market, and we expect that to be in 2017. In terms of APOQUEL, I will ask Paul to answer the question on the inventory channel.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Sure. And I'll come back and hit the DTC question as well. With respect to APOQUEL and the channel, I think we saw a much more normalized pull-through of APOQUEL in Q2 than we had in Q1. Anybody that wants APOQUEL can get it now. They can order what they want. And so, we're starting to see a more normalized or a matching between our revenues and the products that are moving out through the various clinics where it's been stocked.","You hit it right on the head. I mean, earlier when people were not quite convinced that we've put the supply chain issues behind us, people were hording it or holding it in the office to ensure they had supply. But that is, from our perspective, less and now you're seeing normal stocking and pull-through of the product. There may be pockets where it's still there, but much more normalized; and we're excited about prospects for APOQUEL.","With respect to DTC, and if you think about DTC for potentially two products, it's APOQUEL and it could be SIMPARICA, I'd just say that within our guidance or within our OpEx guidance for 2016 and 2017, there are dollars allocated for promotional programs, including DTC. I think when I talk about \u2013 and during my prepared remarks, not ignoring opportunities to invest and say, we made assumptions about the level of promotional spend against all of our product franchises. And it's currently embedded within our guidance for 2016 and 2017 to the extent that we see great returns from certain promotional activities, we may well increase them in the future. But for now, they're baked in.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Let me add one comment of APOQUEL. And in APOQUEL, we have seen that most of the use of the product has been in chronic conditions. Now the effort of our people, it's really to promote the product to expand also the use to acute indication. That is something that we are confident that over time the opportunity of APOQUEL will continue growing.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. As long as you went there. Some great statistics that I think are helpful, but people think about APOQUEL and the potential for APOQUEL, whether it's in the U.S. or outside. If you take the universe of itchy dogs, over half of itchy dogs are considered acute. They have average treatment days of a couple of weeks. And so, on a percentage of the market basis, it's not great, but there is a lot of opportunity for us there. And of course the thought is the next largest group in terms of a percentage are the seasonal itchy dogs and then the smallest is the chronic. About 20% are chronic; it's a little less than 20% are chronic.","And, of course, our view is that when you have an acute situation and you bring a dog is there's that opportunity where that dog can get excellent relief from using a product like APOQUEL. And to the extent that it turns out that that dog has seasonal issues, then, well, it can move into a different category.","So there is a lot of opportunity here for us. We started off by really focusing on that slightly less than 20% of the market that was in the chronic category, albeit when they go on to therapy, they go on for a large number of days. I'll stop there.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thanks. On your restructuring, SKU rationalization, overall cost structure initiatives, how should we think about the quarterly progression throughout the year? What would you \u2013 or would you say you're running ahead of plan? What were you able to accomplish in the quarter and what's left to do on that front?","And then my second question is on capital deployment. Can you just sort of outline your near term and longer term priorities there, particularly as cash flow builds heading into next year? What is your guidance also assuming in the way of share repurchases? And if I can ask just a really quick housekeeping question \u2013 if you haven't broken it out yet, the U.S. sales and International sales of APOQUEL? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. So I will answer the first question on \u2013 I think it was a question on APOQUEL? But let me \u2013 did you ask...","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","It was the restructuring process.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Restructuring. Okay. So let me cover that. So we are ahead of our plans, and we mentioned that we expect that to generate more than $300 million. The initial target was $300 million. So also the good news is that we are ahead in the implementation and we'll generate in 2016 also higher savings than initially expected.","In terms of the SKU rationalization, plans are in line with expectation. We have eliminated the majority of the SKUs now. There are still some few SKUs that we decided to keep until we have some other product that will be replacing these SKUs. So we'll minimize the impact of the reduction.","And in terms of the plans that we included as divestment or exiting, we did almost all the work now. Countries that we changed the distribution model has been fully implemented. So we are definitely extremely pleased with all the progress that we made in this program. So, Paul, will talk about the capital deployment.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah, I will take capital deployment. I think we continue to look for ways to invest our cash flow back in our business where we could earn the highest returns. Certainly to M&A and as we said pretty consistently, to the extent that there's not a better call on our cash flow within our business for M&A, then when will distribute it back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We are currently purchasing shares at the rate of about 75 million a quarter. We have a program that runs through the balance of 2016; and we're obviously in the process of looking at 2017 and beyond and thinking through what we'll do there.","But, Erin, you bring up a great point and it's something we talk about quite a bit. 2016, we don't really demonstrate through our quarter results the real cash-generating properties of our business. 2017 will be the first opportunity for the market to see in our reported results the ability of this company to generate significant free cash flow.","And the reasons for that are the obvious ones that we're completing our standup from Pfizer, and that's been expensive and lengthy; we are completing \u2013 or generally completing the payments for implementing our efficiency initiative and we hope to put those behind us by the end of 2016. And so, when we enter 2017, you're going to see a much more normalized level of cash generation from this company. And as we generate that cash, we will stick to the model of looking for ways to deploy inside, outside in value-generative M&A. And last and certainly not least, in the form of our dividends and share repurchases.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. So you also asked about sales for APOQUEL U.S.\/international. U.S. is about 75% of the total amount that we reported for the first half and 25% for international.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Is that the first half?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","First half, yes.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Just so it's clear.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.","Alex Arfaei - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good morning, folks, and congratulations on a strong quarter; and, Paul, thank you for the great visibility. Good stuff, as we like to say. Apologies if I missed this, but the tax rate was a little bit lower than we expected. I'm wondering if you could give us your updated thoughts there and if there's any updates regarding your longer term expectations?","And just a follow-up on the capital allocation strategy, given current market demand for yield and is there an opportunity to kind of reevaluate share repurchases as opposed to more aggressive increase in your dividend, particularly given that as you just mentioned, your cash flow generation and predictability should improve after 2017? Thank you.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Sure. I'll start with the tax rate. Yeah. The tax rate was a little bit lower, but you should note we did not change our guidance for the full year 2016. Tax is a fun thing. It's like I talked about how difficult it can be to calculate or predict the impact of FX on your gross margin. Similarly, trying to forecast your tax rate by quarter or by half year, the longer the period you're forecasting, the more accurate you're going to be. It is entirely likely and possible that we'll see some discrete items in the second half of our year that would cause our tax rate to be higher in the second half than it would be in the first.","Generally, what I want to report is, we've made excellent progress in managing our tax position in light of the challenge that was thrown at us by the European Commission in January of this year; and we feel good heading into 2017 that we'll be able to achieve the effective tax rate that we've guided to on adjusted pre-tax of roughly 30%. So I'll leave it at that.","And I think your other question there was around dividend versus share repurchase and how do you think about that perhaps as you move into 2017 with a more normalized cash flow coming out of the company. Let me say it's something that we will more likely address in detail later in the year.","As I said, as we go through the process of looking at 2017 in some detail and we'll come back to you. Just state that we intend to return to shareholder's, through dividends or share repurchases, capital that's not needed to invest productively within our business or for M&A. I know a lot of you would \u2013 we've been out in meetings to say do you have a personal preference for share repurchase versus dividend. Let's leave that discussion for the fall.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Holford - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to get a quick comment from the management team there, just where your barometer is right now on M&A and business development? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So we define that the first priority in terms of capital allocation is investing internally. We have a significant return on R&D, significant return on also the commercial activities. Second would be M&A. And, M&A, we consider a scenario that we will continue assessing any opportunity in the market and bringing to our company things that will enhance our core business or will complement our portfolio.","We mentioned that diagnostics was an area that we entered some years ago, and we are committed to this area. And we will continue assessing and bringing additional opportunities to our diagnostic portfolio.","Genetics is another area that we are already participating. We have seen that genetic is growing very fast in terms of genetic markets and also in terms of other areas that also will support the increase of productivity in livestock. Definitely, we'll be assessing the opportunities to participate in this broader market.","And actually, we will consider how we can enhance our core portfolio in livestock, companion animal or aquaculture now that we are also participating in aquaculture. We use also business development to support our R&D efforts. And we will continue partnering with universities, also with biotech companies and other partners that will also support our R&D efforts.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI.","Volodymyr Nikolenko - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you for taking my question. It's Vlad Nikolenko on behalf of Mark Schoenebaum. First of all, congratulation with the quarter's strong performance, EBIT and EPS. It's very nice and (53:20) that. So the question will be about the guidance and longer term margins. So back in November 2014, the company issued the long-term guidance for the first time given target 34% operating margin in 2017. So I'm wondering \u2013 and since that day, they just never re-issued the longer term guidance and did not expand to further years. So wondering if you're planning to provide longer term guidance in the future or it was more like one-time event in advance of restructuring a month later.","And if there is no long-term guidance, how should we think about operating margins going forward? And if you can also specifically and whether there is a limit for operating margin growth and whether you can specifically quantify contribution from the product gross margin growth due to ongoing supply network rationalization initiative? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Thank you. Let me make a short comment on the guidance that we provided back in November 2014; and then I will pass to Paul on how we see this margin evolving over time. So the first thing, almost three years ago or two years-and-a-half after we made this projection, we are confirming that in 2017 we'll be improving or reaching that 34% EBIT margin. And moving from at that time 25% that was projected for the end of 2014 to 34%, it's a significant improvement. And I think it's probably the confirmation of the predictability and the sustainability of our business. I think there are not too many companies that after three years they can maintain what I consider of course an aggressive target of improving our margin by 900 basis points. Now I will turn to Paul to provide some additional comments.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah, sure. And I want to be real clear. One, why did we provide long-term guidance? We provided that because we knew the steps that we were about to embark on would include the SKU rationalization, the change in business models outside the U.S. and a pretty substantial change in our OpEx base. And in light of that, outside parties trying to forecast what we would look like in 2016 and then in 2017, you would've had no chance to really be able to be somewhat accurate. And so, we felt compelled to provide longer term guidance to let people determine through their own models whether they were in the neighborhood of what we were thinking or they had a difference of opinion.","I think that was a one-time event. We, like most other companies, are reverting to having just \u2013 will revert to having just one year worth of guidance on the Street. So we'll provide the update, as I mentioned, in my prepared remarks for 2017 later this year and then we'll have 2017 on the board. But I really want to focus on comments, Vlad, that you made around the 34% kind of operating EBIT margin \u2013 or excuse me, adjusted EBIT margin target that you referenced. Because I want to be really, really clear. We're not targeting a maximum operating margin. We're seeking to maximize our cash flow and grow it at a fast rate. If that's at a 33% margin, that's okay; if that's at a 36% margin, that's okay too, but it's not focusing solely on what is that margin and let's maximize that margin. We're looking at maximizing earnings as a proxy for cash flow and then growing it as quickly and for as long as we can at an attractive rate.","Now, separately I believe you asked about is there an upper limit. One of the advantages of our company is that we have a wonderful global footprint where we have the scale to support that global footprint and generally \u2013 not completely, but generally, we have the ability to drive a lot more revenue on the infrastructure that we have deployed around the globe.","So the answer is, yeah, we have the ability to continue to leverage our cost structure and thereby improve that operating margin. But what I don't want people to do is to focus on and say, a 33% or a 35% or \u2013 and look at that and say, well, gee, that's less than I thought. The goal is not to continue to drive that percentage; it's to maximize profit, cash flow, grow it and grow it fast and grow it for a long time. So I rambled a little bit there, but I hope I covered your question.","Operator","The next question comes from David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David R. Risinger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sorry. I was just coming off mute there. Thanks very much. I was just hoping for a bit of a higher level framework for where you are with the restructuring and reorganizing of Zoetis. My sense is that you're about two-thirds of the way done of rationalizing SKUs and rationalizing people and your SG&A, et cetera. But, obviously, it's different for the cost of goods sold line than the SG&A line. So I was hoping that you could just provide a little bit higher level framework for how far you are along with the rationalization and restructuring by cost line? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","So thank you, Dave. Let me maybe provide a little bit more details on where I see we are in terms of our progress in terms of restructuring efforts. So I would say that all the efforts in terms of commercial and R&D are mostly completed. What we are still not fully finalized is related to some areas of G&A, mainly finance and IT, because this was also dependent on the implementation of SAP and we wanted to make sure that while we were transitioning to a different model \u2013 a more efficient model, we were ensuring the compliance of any type of finance, tax or IT elements. But we have no doubt that by the end of the year, all the programs will be in place and we'll start 2017 with a new base.","In terms of SKUs, I said most of the work has been completed. And there are only some SKUs that we'll be eliminating from now until the end of the year; and this will be also with the introduction of new product that also will help us to minimize a negative impact of this last SKU rationalization.","The other area that is still work in progress, but also progressing in line with expectations is the manufacturing changes. We exit the seven plants that we targeted. There is one plant that is still in progress, but five have been sold, one has been exited and the other one is in process. So in that area, things are progressing very well.","There are some structural changes also in manufacturing that are a work in progress. And, again, so we plan to finalize this work by the end of the year and start 2017 with a full implemented plan for the operational efficiency program that we announced in 2015.","Operator","The next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","This is Jonathan (01:02:05) on the line for Jami. Juan Ram\u00f3n, your discussion on R&D productivity is encouraging, but if possible we'd like to receive greater transparency on what that means. We're expecting 5% to 6% of operational growth for the next five years. Can you help us parse out what contribution comes from same product, same indication sales growth through price and volume? And based on your expectations for R&D productivity, what contribution is expected from new products and label expansions that come from this investment? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","The answer to this question in R&D is also answering how much are we allocating to new product innovation and how much we are allocating to lifecycle innovation. And we have actually buckets in our R&D expenses, one is related to regulatory expenses, about 15%; and then the other 85%, it's split between new product innovation and lifecycle innovation. So we are investing significantly to keep our current portfolio updated and competitive.","So how much are we generating in terms of growth in-line compared to new products and price. So we describe that the animal health industry will be growing 5% to 6% in the next coming years. About half of these 5% to 6% will be related to price; and then in-line, we'll have half of the growth and new products have half of the remaining growth. The ability of Zoetis and other companies to grow faster than this 5% to 6% will come from new products.","So, in 2016, excluding the impact of SKU rationalization, in the second quarter, this normalized operational growth is 9%. So how much came from the price? It was about 3% from price. New products also generated a significant part of this growth; and the in-line portfolio, it was growing volume by 1%. So the rest of the portfolio, APOQUEL generated 3 percentage points, other new products another 2 percentage points.","So you see that the new products in the second quarter were generating about 500 basis points out of this 900 normalized organic operational growth. And that is what we also expect there for the future. For the future, we have communicated that we plan to grow in-line faster than market. In 2017, based in our guidance, we plan to grow faster than the market; and this faster growth will come from new product launches.","Operator","And the next question comes from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.","Chris Schott - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Just two quick ones here. First is on restructuring. To the extent that there are excess savings relative to your initial plan, should we think about those savings falling to the bottom line or are those likely to be reinvested in the business?","And the second question was on China, you've had very strong growth for last couple of quarters. How much of this is near term in nature given some of the topics you described in the commentary versus sustainable step-up in growth in that part of the business? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, let me start with the question on how much we plan to circulate the excess of the savings into our profits and how much we plan to reinvest. And the answer will be, if we see opportunities of reinvestment, these extra savings that will generate future of growth and future profitable growth, then always we will decide to reinvestment in areas that will create future higher value for all our shareholders. And if we'll have these opportunities, then these excess savings will go to our profits. In China...","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","Hold on, before you flip to China. Again, I want to make this point and it was in my prepared remarks, but it's an important point. Efficiency initiative was all about eliminating non-productive expenses. Those are expenses that don't drive value for our company. So to the extent that we eliminate those, the returns are awesome. It's the first thing anyone should do is eliminate non-productive investments in the business.","That gives us the ability to consider investments that will produce outside returns back in our business. And so, it's a very important point. And, by the way, when we boarded on that efficiency initiative, we targeted the $300 million and we believe we're going to be able to deliver savings beyond that.","This sort of activity is a continuous process. It doesn't start and end when we announced the program last year. This is something that we will continue on and we look for ways to eliminate those non-productive expenses; and you can have the choice of either having enhanced near term profitability or we may see opportunities to redeploy those funds in more productive areas. So I wanted to make that point. Do you want to talk about China?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Yeah. In China, we see China as a country that will continue offering high opportunities for growth. We describe many times China as the largest producer of pork in the world. They have more than 600 million (pigs). Some of the statistics there are also indicating that they have 800 million of pigs; and still a lot of this production is not consolidated or is not highly sophisticated. And we expect that this will represent big opportunities for companies like Zoetis that can offer products that will increase the productivity and the quality and safety of the production in China.","We also have seen opportunities in other species like cattle. The objective for us in cattle is to build a stronger portfolio, especially to build a stronger portfolio in vaccines. And the way that we are doing that is first trying to get approval for a portfolio that is already available in other markets, also in China. And second, to invest in R&D locally to produce specific vaccines for cattle, for swine and also for poultry.","And this is a strategy that we are following, and we are convinced that China will continue growing, not only in livestock, we have seen a significant success in our portfolio in companion animal. We have now a portfolio, which is covering vaccines and covering some other products. We still have the opportunity in China to approve APOQUEL in the future \u2013 to approve SIMPARICA. This will take some time, but we are convinced that the potential growth of China will continue.","There has been in the second quarter some additional growth coming from these extra acquisitions from channel distributors in anticipation of changes on the label. This is mainly administrative changes rather than a lot of work really to update the indications updates there (01:10:23). So you have seen that we wanted to ensure that the product will be continually available in the market without any kind of a reduction.","Paul S. Herendeen - Zoetis, Inc.","I want to make one \u2013 it's one point, and Juan Ram\u00f3n covered this. But China, from a growth perspective, is attractive both on the companion animal front and the livestock front. And so that's an important point and I think he covered the structural elements that will lead to we believe good long-term growth opportunities.","What's also interesting about China is how it affects one of our other key markets, which is Brazil. I think many of you may have seen recently an article that talked about the increase in exports of beef from Brazil to China. That's a good thing for us, because we're present in Brazil and that helps with the health of our customer base in Brazil. So China has a pretty interesting influence on our business, both for what we do there, but also on other segments of our company.","Operator","We'll go next to Douglas Tsao with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Douglas Tsao - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just really quickly, in terms of APOQUEL, I think you said that you're selling without restrictions since May. Just curious what the sales would have been this quarter if you'd have been able to sell without restrictions the entire time?","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Well, it's always difficult to respond to these hypothetical questions, so I think definitely much higher than what we reported and not only in the U.S., but also in the other markets. So imagine that we have had APOQUEL fully available and fully launched in all markets from January 1, then definitely the revenues will be much higher than the $100 million at this point. How much, I think, is difficult to assess. But we are convinced that the opportunity is not only on having the product available without restrictions to all markets, to all customers, but the opportunity also to expand the use of APOQUEL not only to chronic, but also to acute indications.","And this is where we're making a lot of efforts and we are considering different ways of communicating through veterinarians and also different ways to communicate that to pet owners to increase the awareness of the product and to make sure that the pet owners are also going to the clinics asking for APOQUEL for both chronic, but also acute indications.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go next to Erin Wilson with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wilson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups on innovation, new products. Can you speak to the value proposition of IL-31 and monoclonal antibodies in the veterinary setting just in general? And on SIMPARICA, would the cat indication for SIMPARICA likely be a topical product and would it likely have the same sort of six-month age restriction similar to the canine chewable? Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Let me start with the easiest answer on the cat. So definitely cats, in general, they don't like pills. And if you want to really to succeed in the cat market, you need to offer a topical indication; and this is what would be working in our R&D program really to bring this product into the market. So IL-31 still is a product that has been commercialized under a conditional license. It means that we still have very limited promotional activities for IL-31. So we want \u2013 or we focus during this period until full license to get the experience of using this product and also to develop all the data that will support the approval, the full license of IL-31.","The feedback from the market so far is very positive. And, again, it's very complementary to APOQUEL. APOQUEL will be in both, acute and chronic. IL-31 being a product which is injectable, maybe we will position more in chronic than acute, but still will be opportunities for both indications.","And as I said, in terms of efficacy, greater response from the veterinarians, mainly dermatologists and some experienced veterinarians and also great on safety. So I think all the indications are very positive to IL-31. And this will be, as I said, very complementary to our atopic dermatitis franchise (01:15:31) itching conditions. And we are very pleased with what we are doing.","Last comment on SIMPARICA. So we continue to see SIMPARICA as a platform. So the active ingredient of SIMPARICA will be used for combination products, also for oral, for atopical; and we are convinced that this will be a significant product in our portfolio. And I think just to remind that in the cat business \u2013 or parasiticide, the cat market, we have REVOLUTION and REVOLUTION is performing very well. And we also expect that with the new lifecycle innovation that we are applying to SIMPARICA, the REVOLUTION penetration also will also be reinforced.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions. I'll return the floor to you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, for any closing remarks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix - Zoetis, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much for joining us on this call.

We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ramon.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that many of the competitive advantages that have made Zoetis the world leader in animal health. We have been able to deliver steady and reliable financial results for our investors since 2013, consistently growing our revenue factor in the market and growing our adjusted net income faster than revenue each year. ","It is our track record driven by lead innovation, a diverse and durable portfolio and a clear strategy that begins and ends with our customers, their success and the health of their animals. ","Over the last few years, we have consistently brought new innovation to market from our R&D labs, most notably, in dermatology, parasiticides and vaccines, with products like APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT, Simparica, REVOLUTION PLUS and Stronghold Plus and values new vaccines in our Fostera, Suvaxyn, and Vanguard product lines. ","We invest significantly in our productive R&D and rely on the support of our commercial manufacturing and supply chain initiatives to maximize the growth of our products and services. We also invest internally and externally to maintain the most diverse and durable portfolio in the animal health industry. This approach has helped us perform well even in the face of shifting weather patterns, changing market conditions, and the impact that emerging businesses have on our customers.","Recent external investment in diagnostic nutritionals and digital solutions keep us evolving in line with market trends, while enhancing the integrated solutions we offer to our customers, at the same time, better supporting our medicines and vaccine portfolio. This consistent performance made possible by the outstanding talented and dedicated Zoetis colleagues that execute our plans and growth strategies. ","Turning now to our financials, we continued our strong performance through the first half of the year, with 14% operational revenue growth in the second quarter. Diagnostic sales from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 5 percentage points of that overall growth. Our companion animal portfolio is continuing its positive momentum with 22% of operational revenue growth based on diagnostic sales from the Abaxis acquisition, strong sales of our key dermatology drugs and parasiticides. ","As we anticipated, livestock product sales returned to growth in the second quarter up 3% operationally, with increases across all species. Poultry products led the way growing 15% operationally and this was partially offset by more modest growth in the fish, cattle and swine which was impacted by African Swine Fever in China. ","As we indicated last quarter, African Swine Fever remains a major factor for the overall industry growth in 2019. An industry forecast expects the animal health industry to grow around 4% compared to 5.6% in 2018. We believe our diverse portfolio across species, geographies and therapeutic areas will help us once again to grow revenues faster than the market in 2019. ","In terms of profitability, we grew our adjusted net income by 17% operationally in the second quarter and generated our highest gross margin ever. ","Looking at the rest of the year, we are confident in our latest innovation and core business to generate the growth. And we have increased our full year guidance for 2019 based on the positive momentum of our companion animal portfolio, and to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of portfolio exchange rates. ","As we look ahead, we are making good progress with innovation and investment that will generate our future growth. ","In July, Zoetis received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency for our three-way combination parasiticide for dogs. This addition brings Zoetis and veterinarians one step closer to offering pet owners a new choice in the prevention of heartworm disease and lungworm, while also treating fleas and ticks and gastrointestinal worms. We look forward to a final decision from the European Commission later this year. ","Regulatory reviews for the three-way combination are also underway in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan with further submissions expected in China and Mexico this year. If approved, Zoetis anticipates this product coming to market in the first quarter of 2020. Once we have our final label approved, we\u2019ll be able to share more insight on our market expectation for this triple combination product. It is fair to say that we expect this product to be a significant entrant in the more than $4 billion global parasiticide market. ","In all parasiticide use, in July, we gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of ProHeart 12, the industry\u2019s only one-year injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs from one year of age and older. ","We are steadily building an innovative and fresh portfolio of parasiticides that will give the veterinarians a range of choices for dogs and cats, Simparica, REVOLUTION PLUS, ProHeart 12 and 6 and the anticipated triple combination products once approved will make us even more competitive, enable to challenge today's market leaders in parasiticides. We are sustaining and expanding our portfolio in an area where Zoetis was underrepresented historically. ","In the area of monoclonal antibodies, we are the industry leader in innovation with our groundbreaking dermatology product, CYTOPOINT. And we continue to advance our pipeline in other areas like pain. I am pleased to announce that we have filed in the U.S. and EU for a new monoclonal antibody candidate to control pain associated with osteoarthritis in cats and we expect approval in 2021. ","To support this new companion animal products coming to our pipeline and to maximize sales of our current portfolio, including diagnostics, we have already added additional sales force resources in international markets and we are beginning to expand our sales force in the U.S. ","In the second quarter, on the livestock side, we have expanded our Fostera swine vaccine franchise with approvals of different formulations in new geographies. For example, Fostera Gold PCV MH was approved in Brazil. This vaccine which is now commercially available in the U.S., Canada and several other markets, provides the livestock farmers with greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from PCV2 and M. hyo. And Fostera PCV, a single dose vaccine that aids in the prevention of PCV2 was approved in China. ","We also combined our internal innovation approach with external collaborations. In that regard, we've recently signed an important R&D agreement with the Colorado State University to establish a research lab there. Our teams will explore the livestock immune system and target the discovery of new immunotherapies that could pave the way for alternatives to antibiotics in food production animals.","We also continue to support future growth through business developmental activities. In July, we announced plans to acquire Platinum Performance, a privately held nutrition-focused animal health company that is highly regarded in the equine community. Platinum features premium nutritional product formulas and a unique approach to the field of scientific wellness for horses as well as dogs and cats. The expansion in nutritions will further strengthen our portfolio in the equine and pet care markets, and it aligns well with Zoetis, increasing focus on health and wellness as part of the continuum of animal care. ","We expect the acquisition to be completed in the third quarter of this year after meeting customary closing conditions. Our plan is to expand the Platinum Performance equine business through our U.S. field force, accelerate the growth in its pet care formulas with veterinarians and pet owners through our digital marketing capabilities and evaluate international expansion opportunities over the long-term. ","Finally, in closing, we remain on track for a strong year based on our diverse portfolio. And we are making important progress in key areas such as parasiticides, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, diagnostics and digital and data analytics, areas where we see both near and long-term growth opportunities. ","I will now hand the call over to Glenn. Glenn?","Glenn David","Thank you, Juan Ramon, and good morning. As Juan Ramon said, we delivered another strong quarter growing revenue 14% operationally and adjusted net income 17% operationally. ","Based on our positive performance in the first half of 2019, we are increasing our revenue and adjusted diluted EPS outlook for the year. I\u2019ll review updated guidance in more detail after discussing Q2 performance. ","Reported revenue growth for the second quarter was 9% including a 5% negative impact from foreign exchange primarily driven by the continued strengthening of the dollar against the euro and Brazilian real. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational revenue growth for the quarter was 9% with price contributing 4% and volume contributing 5%. ","Key dermatology products contributed 2%, other in-line products 2% and new products 1%. All species contributed to growth this quarter with companion animal growth continuing to outpace livestock. ","Companion animal operational revenue growth of 22% was driven by legacy Abaxis products, key dermatology product and paracitisides. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, companion animal grew 14% operationally. Livestock operational revenue growth of 3% is driven by all species including swine despite the impact of African Swine Fever in China. ","Poultry was the primary contributor to livestock growth internationally and in the U.S. and international sales of cattle also contributed. Legacy Abaxis products contributed 5% to total Zoetis operational revenue growth in the quarter with sales of $65 million. This represents a decline over the pro forma revenue from the prior year primarily driven by product launches and initial distributor stocking which occurred in the first half of 2018. ","We expect improved results in the second half of 2019 with double-digit revenue growth driving full year pro forma growth in diagnostics products. Our focus continues to be on the integration of the legacy Abaxis products into our portfolio allowing us to leverage our innovative offering of diagnostic and therapeutic products and international expansion. ","Our key dermatology portfolio continued solid growth this quarter with sales of a $182 million, a 30% operational increase over the prior year. Growth in this portfolio was driven by the ongoing expansion of the addressable market increasing market share, price and additional launches of both APOQUEL and CYTOPOINT into new markets. We expect to exceed $700 million in revenue for this portfolio in 2019. ","Other in-line products also contributed strong growth in the quarter including Simparica with $69 million in revenue and 40% operational growth. This growth was partially offset by the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever. New products, including our topical parasiticide for cats REVOLUTION PLUS and Stronghold Plus, our swine combination vaccines and Core EQ Innovator in equine also contributed to drive growth this quarter.","Now, let's discuss the revenue growth by segments for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 15% in the second quarter, companion animal grew 23% while livestock grew 3%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 9%.","Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, our key dermatology portfolio, and number of our in-line products, including Simparica, Clavamox, Cerenia and ProHeart 6. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 13%. ","U.S. dermatology sales were $127 million for the quarter growing 27% driven by market expansion, increasing market share and price. Simparica sales in the quarter were $40 million, growing 33% over the prior year. Simparica benefited from promotional investments, leading to increased clinic penetration and market share gains. U.S. livestock sales returned to growth this quarter increasing 3%.","Poultry was the primary driver of U.S. livestock growth due to the strong performance of our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives in this fast growing market. Lack of efficacy and supply constraints of competitor products also contributed to growth of our products. Our swine portfolio contributed modestly to growth driven by promotional programs in the quarter.","Our cattle products declined modestly this quarter negatively impacted by ongoing dairy market challenges as well as wet weather impacting the movement of beef cattle to feedlots. These market challenges were partially offset by price. Overall, a strong quarter for our U.S. business. Innovation, diversity and consistent field force execution are all helping to deliver positive performance. ","Turning now to our international segment. Revenue grew 10% operationally in the second quarter. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 21%, while livestock operational revenue growth was 4%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, international revenue grew 8% operationally. Companion animal product growth was driven by key dermatology products, parasiticides, namely Simparica and Stronghold Plus and the additional legacy Abaxis products. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 16%. ","International livestock also returned to growth this quarter, driven primarily by strong performance of our poultry portfolio, primarily vaccines and medicated feed additives. Our cattle portfolio also contributed to growth resulting from a favorable comparison to the prior year, which was negatively impacted by national trucking industry strike that occurred in Brazil. ","Our swine portfolio was flat compared to the prior year with growth in vaccines, including new products, offset by the impacts of African Swine Fever in China.","Now, I would like to highlight a few markets in the quarter. Beginning with China, revenue declined 1% operationally, which is strong performance considering the negative impact of African Swine Fever. Our livestock portfolio in China declined 18% operationally. The outbreak of African Swine Fever continues challenging the supply of pork. Latest estimates assume a range of 30% to 70% of the swine herd will be impacted.","We now anticipate that full year impact to our swine revenue to be approximately $50 million. We continue to anticipate other regions, primarily Brazil and the EU to increase exports of pork to China. However, the timing and magnitude remains uncertain as it takes time and investment in infrastructure to increase production. ","Our companion animal products continued to perform well growing 22% operationally in the quarter. Sales from paracitisides, newly launched APOQUEL and vaccines were the primary drivers of growth. ","Moving on to Brazil, sales grew 24% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 36% and livestock growth of 19%. ","Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by paracitisides, primarily Simparica and our key dermatology portfolio. We recently launched CYTOPOINT into this growing companion animal market and are pleased with its performance so far. Livestock growth in Brazil was primarily driven by favorable comparison to the prior year when the national truck driver strike negatively impacted the results. We anticipate an unfavorable impact in Q3 2019 results for Brazil related to the positive impact at the end that the strike had in Q3 2018. ","The UK also performed well this quarter with operational revenue growth of 24% with companion animal growing 38% and livestock growing 7%. Companion animal growth was primarily related to our key dermatology portfolio and the addition of legacy Abaxis products. The livestock growth was attributable to increased sales of cattle products. ","In Mexico, sales grew 20% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 25% and livestock growth of 18%. This market benefited from key dermatology sales including launch of CYTOPOINT and legacy Abaxis products in companion animal, while livestock growth was related to market conditions driving growth across the product portfolio. ","Other emerging and developed markets also continued to perform well this quarter particularly in companion animal and poultry. ","Summarizing international performance, we demonstrated continued strength across all species in almost all international markets despite the impact of African Swine Fever. Now moving on to the rest of the P&L, adjusted gross margin of 70.5% increased approximately 180 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The improvement this quarter is primarily related to foreign exchange, price, product mix and unit cost improvements, partially offset by an inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio. ","Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, grew 12% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and increase in certain compensation-related expenses and investments to support future growth of the business. ","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. The decrease in the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to discrete tax benefits recorded in the second quarter, partially offset by the impact of the global intangible low taxed income or GILTI tax which is effective for Zoetis in 2019. ","Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 17% operationally through a combination of revenue growth, improving gross margins and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% operationally in the quarter versus the same period in 2018. ","Now moving on to guidance for the full year. As a result of our strong growth in revenue and adjusting net income in the first half of the year, we are raising and narrowing our revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Please note, that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late July. ","I'll now walk you through each of the individual line items beginning with revenue. We're now expecting to deliver revenue between $6.175 billion and $6.275 billion representing 8.5% to 10% operational growth as compared to our previous estimated range of 7.5% to 9.5%. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of Abaxis, is now projected to be between 5.5% and 7%. The increase in revenue guidance is related to the positive performance in our companion animal portfolio, and to a lesser extent, favorable foreign exchange. ","We're now projecting adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be between 30% and 31% compared to our previous estimate of 31% to 32%. Favorability reflects the improvements in the first half of the year, which are expected to moderate in the second half of the year. We're increasing the low and high end of the range for adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.505 billion and $1.545 billion due to increased revenue estimates and promotional investments on key products, primarily in the companion animal portfolio. ","As Juan Ramon mentioned, this includes an expansion of our U.S. companion animal field force to support current and future product launches, such as ProHeart 12, our three-way combination parasiticides for dogs and monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain. ","We're narrowing the range for R&D expense, now expected to be between $450 million and $465 million. Full year adjusted interest and other income deductions is now expected to be approximately $190 million compared to the previous estimate for $200 million. The additional favorability is primarily driven by the reduction of interest expense, and favorable foreign exchange. ","Our expectation for the full year adjusted effective tax rate is approximately 20% compared to our initial guidance of 20% to 21%, primarily driven by the incremental tax benefits from stock-based compensation and other discrete tax benefits recorded in the first half of 2019. ","Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.735 billion, representing an increase of $35 million at the high end of the range reflecting operational increases, as well as favorable foreign exchange. ","Based upon our strong performance in revenue and adjusted net income, we're increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.60, compared to our previous guidance, of $3.42 to $3.52. Our range for reported diluted EPS is also increasing, now expected to be in the range of $2.93 to $3.04 based upon operational increases and lower certain significant items. ","As I've indicated in the past, we focus on full year performance as quarterly results may fluctuate. To that end, we expect Q3 operational revenue growth to be lower than what we've seen in the first half of the year, due to Abaxis having less of an impact on growth as we lap the acquisition date. Q3 2018 included one month of revenue for international and two months for the U.S., Canada and Latin America. ","In addition, we will continue to see market challenges due to African Swine Fever and the weakness in the U.S. dairy and beef sectors. Growth will also be impacted by moderated price increases in the U.S. as well as the recovery of the Brazil truck driver strike and increased revenue in Q3 2018. ","Adjusted net income operational growth in Q3 will also reflect higher operating expenses as reflected in the full year guidance to support our current and future products, resulting in moderated income growth. We previously communicated that we expect approximately $100 million in incremental capital expenditure this year to information technology and manufacturing to support our Abaxis acquisition, improve cost efficiencies and increase capacity. We anticipate continuing at this elevated level for the next three years as we invest in manufacturing and infrastructure to support future growth and product launches. ","We\u2019ve also repurchased approximately $300 million of Zoetis shares in the first half of the year. We have $2 billion remaining under the multi-year share repurchase plan that was approved last year and remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investments, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders. Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q2. ","Now to summarize before we move to Q&A, our strong performance in the first half of 2019 continues to underscore the value of our diversity, innovation and durable business model. We\u2019re confident in our revised full year guidance, where we\u2019re increasing operational growth rate for revenue and adjusted net income. And we continue to focus on long-term sustainable growth by investing in our pipeline, including infrastructure to support current and future product launches. ","Now, I\u2019ll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Juan Ramon wanted to start off with African Swine Fever, I appreciate the update that Glenn gave on the full year impact of $50 million. How much do you think Brazil and the EU and other markets can help to offset the headwinds you\u2019re seeing in China? And then my second question is on Simparica Trio. With the submissions in Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan, can you give us an update on timing for those markets as well as kind of what you\u2019re feeling about in the EU? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you Kevin and let me go through the different questions that you have asked. In terms of the African Swine Fever, we expect minimal impact in terms of additional revenue generated in Europe and other markets this year. As we have explained, it will take some time to build the infrastructure to increase the number of pigs, our potential export to China. We see Europe, Brazil as the main markets for this type of exportation to China but we are not expecting a significant impact of that expansion in 2019. Definitely in 2020, 2021, it will be time for producers to expand their operations and then potentially export to China. ","In terms of the submission on Simparica Trio in other markets like Brazil, Canada, Japan, well it's a work in progress. In Canada, we have already filed all the submission. In some other markets, we are now progressing the submission. And we expect also Simparica Trio to be approved in Europe, around September, October. What we got now is favorable opinion from the European Medicines Agency. Now the European Commission is expected to approve the product in September and October. And then we expect that to bring this product into the market in the first half of -- in the first quarter of 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. ","Jon Block ","I'm not going to put them all upfront. So first, on the implied OpEx growth in the back half of '19 is about 3.5%. I think that\u2019s what -- you largely lap Abaxis and the increased investments you referenced. So is that a good growth rate to extrapolate going forward? I guess just to push you a little bit on gross margin, your guidance applies a step down in the back part of the year. But why is that the case considering higher margin companions growing faster than livestock? And I think that's unlikely to wind -- unwind, pardon me in the near term. And then quickly, one, Ramon, the filing for pain, and I just want to make sure, I think that was specific to fee line, is that correct? And where would canine be in the process? Thanks, guys.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Jon. So we have filed for cats and we are in the process of filing also for dogs. We expect the product for cats, the monoclonal antibody for cats to be approved earlier than for dogs. And we expect that approval in 2021. And Glenn will cover the questions on OpEx and the growth rate moving forward. ","Glenn David","Yes, so Jon just to start with gross margin and the step down that's implied for the second half of the year. A, first of all, in the first half, there were some items that were particularly favorable in terms of foreign exchange, as well as the 4% price increase that we experienced in the first half. Also, as you look to the second half, you're correct that we would still expect the growth rate for companion animal to be higher in the second half of the year than livestock, the absolute sales though for livestock are higher in the second half of the year, just based on normal seasonality, where in the first half of 2019 we had higher sales of companion animal in terms of absolute sales. So those are the drivers for gross margin. ","In terms of the OpEx growth, you are correct that in the second half it would apply a deceleration in operating expense growth because of the impact of Abaxis. I'd also point that we do expect a slight change in seasonalization as well between Q2 and Q4 versus what we might have anticipated last year with a little more expense in Q3. As I sort of implied in the prepared remarks, I would not necessarily take that as guidance for 2020, the second half OpEx rate. Obviously we'll provide that as appropriate once we finish our 2020.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you. Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen ","First question I had was with respect to the Nexvet portfolio. Can you give an update on the development and commercialization timelines for those products? And then second question was on ProHeart 12. Do you still see a place in the market where there\u2019s opportunity despite the launch of the triple combo and why or why not? Thank you. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, Louise. The Nexvet portfolio, the monoclonal antibody that we mentioned that we have filed for cats, it\u2019s coming from the Nexvet portfolio, while for dogs we have [multi-dollar] programs and we\u2019ll be really submitting or filing the best of what we think would be meeting the requirements of the market. ","And in terms of ProHeart 12, definitely we see opportunities to expand the market with ProHeart 12. Part of the sales will be categorized in ProHeart 6 but also at the same time gaining the share in the heartworm market. And also we need to consider the opportunities of ProHeart 12, also with the future launch of the three-way combination that will be included also in the same indications of ProHeart 12 plus the protection for pigs and fish. ","Next question please. ","Operator","Next question is from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","A couple of questions here. So to support some of the new upcoming product launches you mentioned stepped up hiring activity. I guess where do you currently stand in terms of that effort and how should we think about some of the timing related to that as well as how quickly some of those sales reps can ramp up? And will this hiring continue into 2020? ","And then my second question relates to more of the companion animal side. I guess can you speak to the opportunity to leverage the relationships with Chewy and other alternative e-commerce channels, did this meaningfully contribute to growth in the quarter? And more broadly will this become a more significant portion of total sales that go through that channel over time and what sort of pricing mechanisms can you deploy whether it be price forwards or otherwise? Thanks. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Let me start with the question on Chewy and also some alternative channels. So definitely pet owners are also now buying animal health medicines through these new channels, mainly for medicines for chronic treatment and paracitisides. All products are available in these new channels but always with regarded prescription every time when it\u2019s a prescription product. We definitely see these new channels expand in the market and recent time the opportunity also to increase compliance. So we think that this can be definitely a positive for the animal health industry. And we think that at the same time also we\u2019ll be continuing working with veterinarians to ensure that they remain at the center of any healthcare decisions. ","In terms of the field for expansion, I will provide some rational for this expansion and then I will ask Glenn to go into some product details. So just to remember that in recent years we added to our portfolio APOQUEL, CYTOPOINT, Simparica, and all these products are reaching blockbuster sales and without any significant modification in most of the markets in terms of the field force. ","Last year with the acquisition of Abaxis we expanded our portfolio to diagnostics. We incorporated the Abaxis field force into U.S. and in 2019 we have been also expanding diagnostic field force in international markets. In 2019 we have continued adding new products in companion animal, REVOLUTION PLUS during the year that, then ProHeart 12 in July and we've expected the launch of the three-way combination in 2020 and in 2021 monoclonal antibodies to manage the payment in cats and in future also in dogs. We have decided that it was needed to expand our field force in the U.S., not only in phase of these new product launches, but also to maximize the current portfolio that now also includes diagnostics. And we expect to adding these additional resources in 2019 and 2020, at the same time, we\u2019re also adding additional expertise, and investment in new distribution channels, and also in direct-to-consumer programs. ","Now, I would like now, Glenn, to provide some details of these investments.","Glenn David","Yes, Erin, in terms of the timing for the expansion, really there are two main field force expansions that are undergoing in 2019. One is related to Abaxis and international expansion of diagnostic specialists. And we're largely complete with that hiring as of today. So that investment has already been made. People are in place and we expect to get increased revenue penetration in international markets with that field force now being fully operational. ","The other key investments that we\u2019ve discussed with the increase of the companion animal field force in the U.S. We respect those colleagues to be largely hired by the end of 2019. And then to be fully in their new position starting in 2020. So a majority of that investment would also be complete by the end of 2019.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Next question, please. ","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin ","I got a couple really quick ones. One is, you had another quarter of really fantastic price increases, 4%, repeat of 1Q, coming in sort of well above historical trends. I just want to get a sense of this going forward and what's driving it? Is it tied to higher mix of revenues, tied to innovative products like the derm portfolio and Simparica? Or are you taking up price on some of the older generation products as well? ","And then also, I was hoping for a little bit more color on Abaxis. You've had some comments down the field force expansion, you talked about how the portfolio is doing. Anything on competitive share shifts or anything new in the pipeline in terms of innovation there? Thanks. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","I will answer Abaxis, and then Glenn will lead to details of the Q2 and also the pricing and also he will provide some comments on the Abaxis performance in Q1, Q2 and what we expect for the future. Let me start saying that we consider 2019 for Abaxis as a year in we are setting ourselves for future growth. We are expanding the field force in international markets. We feel that we have the resources to generate future revenues. We are also integrating the field force in the U.S. with our core field force. And it's something that is already done. And we\u2019re also working to make sure that we have the connectivity with all the equipments with effective management system that we expect to finalize at the end of 2019. We are also -- we have planned that in the first quarter of 2020 we have also integrated all the systems and this will facilitate the integration of the portfolio and offering a much more integrated offer to our customers. So we are convinced that we are now stepping all the elements for our future success and this will be something that will be generating growth in the future as well as the growth in 2019. Glenn, you mind covering the additional comments on Abaxis performance and also the comments on price? ","Glenn David","Sure as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in the first half of the year Abaxis on a pro forma basis did decline versus the same period last year. That was really driven by the fact that Abaxis had two significant product launches last year that resulted in some additional distributor stocking for both the urine sediment analyzer and the Flex4 Rapid Test. That being said in second half of the year we expect to see double-digit growth for the Abaxis portfolio as we\u2019ve seen very positive leading indicators that would support those projections for the second half of the year. We\u2019re seeing less accretion in the U.S. in terms of instrument placements, also stronger instrument sales and we believe that will lead to increased sales of consumables. Also the fact that the international field force is now in place, we\u2019re seeing good momentum to start beginning within our international markets. So we\u2019re expecting double-digit growth in Abaxis revenues for the second half of the year. ","In regards to price in the first half versus the full year, so we typically expect to get price increases of around 2% to 3% in any given year. In the first half of this year we\u2019ve seen price increase of 4%, part of that outsized price is really driven by the fact in Q1 and Q2 of 2018 we had some promotional programs in our U.S. companion animal business that we do not repeat in the first half of 2019. That led to additional price. ","All that being said we still expect 2019 to be in the range of 2% to 3% but probably towards the higher end to that range. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Next question please.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","John Kreger ","Juan Ramon, another question on African Swine Fever. If you think about all the puts and takes that, that outbreak is causing for the worldwide livestock market, what is your early view on how \u201820 might look relative to that 4% global number that you mentioned for this year? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Well we expect 2020 go back to normal growth rates even if the situation in China because of the African Swine Fever will be not resolved. We expect still 2020 China continue suffering because of this outbreak. But we see other markets expanding production. And then in terms of comparison through 2019 we expect higher growth in livestock and also continue with the growth for companion animal. So definitely we expect 2020 back to normal growth rate of 5% to 6%.","Next question please?","Operator","Going next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst ","This is [Thomas Chi] on behalf of Dave. So first question is, can you please discuss the triple combo on NexGard Spectra in Europe including its level of success and the differentiation of Simparica Trio? Second question is if you can comment on other new launch opportunities over the next one to two years? And then finally are there any key U.S. products set the stage for new generic competition over the next one to two years? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Well as you said, we expect the new combination product in Europe competing with NexGard Spectra. Mainly the incidents of heartworm in Europe is much lower than in the U.S. So the resistances are completely different and the real opportunity for the three-way combination product is in the U.S. and where we expect now to be first to the market, because NexGard Spectra or other competitors are not announcing a launch soon. So, definitely we see a significant opportunity to gain share in the U.S. Also we expect that our portfolio will be even stronger in Europe and this also will have the opportunity to generate growth.","In terms of other opportunities in the pipeline, well, I think that we are very pleased with all the products that we are now announcing, the three-way combo, Europe, the U.S. or in other markets, also Canada, Japan, Brazil. We also expect monoclonal antibodies for cats in Europe and the U.S. coming in 2021. And following that we expect also monoclonal antibodies for dogs and definitely we will continue working on bringing new vaccines into the market. So we are convinced that we have a very robust pipeline that will ensure our future growth in line for us in the market.","Next question, please.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","David Westenberg ","So I just want to talk about the cat market. There's potential for cat APOQUEL and of course pain in cat. The cat is obviously under medicalized compared to dog market. What does it make major education efforts? Can you maybe make what might that look like when that investment might be taking place and just overall how do you how do you expect to increase that medicalization market in education not just in terms of the products that they're in education? And I\u2019ve got a second question on ProHeart 12. We had great feedback at AVMA. Basically, they talked about compliance one-year injections much better than I actually anticipated with ProHeart reception. Is there any fear in kind of cannibalization with 6? I understand the ProHeart -- just ProHeart and the triple is going to have worms but just kind of think about the dynamics for potential cannibalization there? Thank you very much. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you for the question Dave. So, definitely the cat market is a market that we need to develop. But pain exists in cats and is something that today there are not valid solutions to manage the pain in cats. We know that there are two elements that we need to consider. First, the number of cats is lower than dogs. And also the number of medicalized cats is lower than the number of medicalized dogs. But having said that, we expect the monoclonal antibodies for cats becoming a blockbuster for Zoetis. It will take maybe some years to fully develop the market. But we are convinced that we will be bringing unmet need and opportunity will be a significant.","We expect in terms of the ProHear 12 cannibalization from ProHeart 6, but what we see is that now Zoetis will be offering to veterinarians all range of solutions for pigs, fleas and internal paracitisides and will be for the veterinarians also to decide what is best for their dogs to use ProHeart 12 in combination with Simparica to use the three-way combination product or what they think is the best for protecting the animals. So even if there will be cannibalization, I think here what we need to consider is what will be the opportunity of this complete portfolio in terms of parasiticides. Next question please. ","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Schott","Just two here. Maybe first just coming back to margin trends and the SG&A investment you\u2019re making. Should we think about OpEx growth below sales growth in 2020 and beyond? Or with some of these initiatives that you\u2019re investing in, could we see a year in 2020 where spend looks a little bit more in line with sales growth as we think about kind of just the progression over the next few years? And my second question was on Simparica Trio, I guess at this point, how much of a lead do you expect you will have in the U.S. market before you see additional competition? And how much of a lead do you think you need to really impact share as we think about the -- probably different players line up in the market? Thanks very much.","Juan Ramon Alaix","I will respond to the Trio question and then Glenn will cover the margin trends and also the expenses that we\u2019ll be seeing in future years. And in terms of Trio as you know Chris in our industry there is not too much visibility in terms of the products that our competitors are making in their pipeline. We know that in the U.S. FDA it\u2019s requiring 100% protection against heartworm. We know that so far it seems that the three-way combination of Zoetis is the only one showing this type of efficacy. ","Other competitors, maybe they will be also facing some challenge because they have products protecting against ticks and fleas for two or three months and then heartworm with one month and then combining a product with different timing also can be challenging. The timing of competition is unknown to us but we are confident that being first to market will present an opportunity to gain share in the parasiticides segment. Glenn?","Glenn David","In terms of the investments that we\u2019re making in the field force, first, I just want to say that these are very positive investments that have a very strong return. So we\u2019re investing in field force to support the existing products that are exceeding our expectations and a significant number of new products that are coming out in the future, those are very high return investments. So we would expect those to be margin accretive over time as we move into 2020. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Next question please. ","Operator","Next is Liav Abraham with Citi. Please go ahead.","Liav Abraham ","Just a follow on question on your three-way combination parasiticide. Juan Ramon, any preliminary thoughts on what the launch curve could look like particularly in the U.S. of this product and how quickly uptick could be? And then secondly, interested in some additional comments on the poultry market, you cited that this has contributed to growth in your livestock segment in the quarter. Interested in your longer term outlook for poultry and some of the drivers behind this? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Liav, so on the three-way combination product, it's probably a little bit too early to define the uptake efforts. We need to ensure that we have clarity on the labels, and it is something that is still work in progress. One, we have the label. And then we also have the exact timing of the launch. We will provide that maybe how much we expect adoption of this new product into the market and is it going to be launching in January and February or March. So it is something that still we don't have a certainty of the timing of the launch. And also, we need to still get the approval of the final label. ","Poultry, it's an area that has been performing too well for Zoetis. We expect that poultry will continue -- for market segment will be continue growing faster than the average of the animal health industry and will be growing in line with this growth. For us, poultry, it's an area in where we are investing also in R&D. And we expect to bring new products into the market starting in 2020. That will be new vaccines with vector-operated technology that initially will be released in the U.S. and then later in European markets and all international countries. And definitely, it will be a surface of four categories in the world. ","And as we see the consumption of animal proteins continue growing, consumers will need to move maybe two more chicken, even more beef, and maybe at least in some countries like China, some limitations in terms of pork consumption. But definitely pork is an area of investment. We have very strong portfolio of vaccines. And again, so we will be planning to launch vector vaccines in 2020 or 2021. ","And finally, we are also combining our presence with medicated feed additives with vaccines, also with a very strong portfolio in terms of devices. We have the Inovoject, which is something that has highly significant value in the hatchery and other another segments of poultry and we also introduced products for automation in 2018 and 2019. ","Next question. ","Operator","Next is Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy Miner ","A couple questions. Glenn, could you give us some APOQUEL sales for the U.S. versus OUS this quarter? And on African Swine Fever, could you also tell us what the second quarter impact was? And if there's any update on the vaccines that you're working on for the swine fever? And then finally just a bigger picture question. I wonder if we could get your thoughts on some of the U.S.-China trade discussions. Understand it\u2019s very volatile but what are some of the possible impacts or situations you're looking for that could be impacting Zoetis? Thank you. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","So let's answer the question on APOQUEL. And then we'll move to African Swine Fever and \u2026","Glenn David","Yes, so just for the numbers for APOQUEL. I'll start with total derm just to give you overall total derm breakout between U.S. and international. So total derm globally we had a $182 million, a $127 million within the U.S., $55 million in international. At APOQUEL we had total global sales of a $133 million, in the U.S. $87 million and international $45 million. Obviously there\u2019s some rounding there. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","And the impact of African Swine Fever?","Glenn David","The impact of African Swine Fever in the quarter was a little over $10 million for the quarter. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","Okay so then in terms of the update of the African Swine Fever. We expect that there\u2019ll be some opportunities for other markets as to supply to China. We also expect that -- we\u2019re not expecting a new vaccine for African Swine Fever soon but we are working on developing this vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. and other international centers. And in terms of trade, we see trade impacting agriculture in the U.S. We have seen also that China would not be buying pork from the U.S. But it\u2019s also true that they will be buying from other markets and maybe other markets also will be buying from the U.S. So we are not at this point too much concerned about the impact of the trade in the pork industry. The pork industry has been very limited in terms of exportation to China. I think it\u2019s something that is less than 20% of the total exportation of pork to international markets and to China. So definitely it\u2019s an impact but it\u2019s an impact which is manageable. But we expect and we hope that finally the U.S. and China will sign an agreement that will eliminate all these tensions. Next question please?","Operator","Next is Mavin Jacob with UBS. Please go ahead.","Prakhar Agrawal","This is Prakhar Agrawal on behalf of Mavin Jacob. My first question is on gross margin. So you\u2019d previously guided on gross margin expansion of 200 basis points from 2017 to 2020 and you\u2019re obviously tracking significantly ahead of that guidance already despite of Abaxis. So just wondering if there is an update to that guidance and is it possible to get greater than 70% gross margin over the next three to five years? And secondly on the macro trends in the U.S. cattle. Could you provide more color on some other trends that you\u2019re seeing? You had that continued weakness in dairy and beef cattle. But when do you expect recovery in these segments? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","So let\u2019s start with the gross margin. Glenn?","Glenn David","In terms of gross margin, the 200 basis points improvement that we referenced from 2017, that was driven by the operational efficiency initiatives and some changes in our supply network that we were initiating. We are on track for that and expect to deliver the 200 basis point. At that time we said there\u2019d be other factors that either positively or negatively impact gross margin over that same period. Those factors being price, mix, foreign exchange. Many of those have moved favorable for us particularly this year and those factors will vary year-over-year. So I would necessarily take some of the benefits that we\u2019ve gotten this year from price mix and foreign exchange necessarily to carry over into the future years. ","So we\u2019re well on track for the 200 basis point improvement that we targeted as far as the operational efficiency initiative and some of the other factors have been beneficial for us in 2019. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","When I look at the macro trends in the U.S. for cattle, we're expecting dairy prices to increase in the second half. It will probably take a longer, so we continue seeing weaknesses in the dairy business coming forward. It will be something that over time will be adjusted. Now they will be adjusting production and then in the next cycle prices will be increasing and then the opportunity for again the expansion. ","In terms of beef in the U.S., there are two elements that have been impacting the performance. And first has been the weather, very cold winter. And then second, very wet spring. And this has been delaying the movement of animals from pasture to the feedlot. And there are moving animals which are heavier, heavier animals also are stronger in terms of protection against diseases. And we see that with the cattle market in their efforts been slower than expected. We expect some recovery in the second half. Although we expect that in the U.S., the cattle will be showing a very modest growth. And Zoetis will be growing in line with this growth. Next question?","Operator","Today's last question is a follow up from Kevin Ellich with Craig Hallum. Please go ahead. ","Kevin Ellich","Juan Ramon, wanted to get your thoughts on the alternative protein market, the plant-based market. Do you think that'll have any impact on the livestock production market over the next three, five, 10 years?","Juan Ramon Alaix","I don\u2019t' believe that this will have an impact. The growth of population, the increase on the middle class, it\u2019s increasing so much at the demand that it will be needed many different sources of feeding the population to meet that demand. And this will be as we have seen in other cases an alternative for people that prefer not to eat animal proteins, but still the demand for the consumption of poultry, chicken, beef, eggs, dairy will remain very strong. And I will also add fish to this list. So I don't expect that the animal health industry will be impacted because of this alternative. But this will -- definitely will offer to consumers options for their diet, which in my opinion is always that positive. ","Juan Ramon Alaix","So thank you very much for joining us today. Well as I said, we had very strong quarter. We have also increased our guidance, which is showing the confidence that we have in the performance of our portfolio. And additionally, we also share with you the good news of our pipeline and how this pipeline will be reaching to market in the next coming years. Thank you very much for your attention.

Good morning everyone.","Today, you will hear commentary on the market dynamics and quarterly result from me and Glenn. I am also pleased to have a Kristin Peck our next CEO joining us to share some remarks with her appointment in the future of Zoetis.","As we near the end of the year, let me provide some context around recent market dynamics. The animal health industry in 2019 as we may facing a challenging year for swine and cut off while we have seen a very good performance in companion animal and poultry.","We have seen growing an appetite in the companion animal market for a spending on innovation and pet care and we once again expect to grow much faster than the market in companion animals for 2019.","We are excited by the new products and lifecycle innovations giving them more advance ways to assist pet owners, weakened skin conditions and parasites. The pathology treatment continues to be a critical need. And Zoetis has been rewarded for the innovation we have developed in this space, we have continued market penetration and our goal expansion of our key dermatology products Apoquel and CYTOPOINT, they are on track to achieve more than $700 million in sales for 2019.","In recent years Zoetis has also been a strengthening its position in parasiticides. This year we added two new products to our parasiticide portfolio, Revolution Plus to protect cats against ticks, fleas and internal parasites and ProHeart 12 once yearly injection to prevent heartworm disease in dogs.","Additionally, we are planning to launch Simparica Trio in the European countries and Canada in the first quarter. In the U.S. we expect the FDA to complete the review of Simparica Trio at the end of the first quarter. If approved, we will launch shortly after. Based on these assumptions, we project to generate incremental global sales of Simparica Trio in 2020 at around $150 million.","In other areas like pain, alternative to existing treatment for dogs and cats we've spent a significant opportunity. And in the case of GILTI tax, it is a largely unmet need today. We are excited by the potential for our researcher programs we have monoclonal antibodies in this area.","As I mentioned in the last quarter, we initiated the filing process in the EU and U.S. for a new fee line monoclonal antibody candidate to treat osteoarthritis, pain in cats and we have recently also initiated the filing process in the EU and U.S. for a canine monoclonal antibody candidate to treat osteoarthritis pain in dogs. If approved, we would anticipate this product coming to market in 2021.","Meanwhile, African swine fever trade uncertainties and weather conditions affecting mainly U.S. cattle, having a significant negative impact on the livestock market. As a result of this negative impact, we expect the overall animal shelter market to grow rationally between 3% to 4% in 2019 compared to 5.6% in 2018. And as note in our guidance, we expect to outpace the market with operational growth in revenue over 6% to 7% and this excluding the positive impact of Abaxis.","Turning now to our third quarter results. We continue our strong performance with 9% operational revenue growth in the third quarter driven by sales of our companion animal and poultry products. Our companion animal portfolio continues leading the way, we had 23% operational growth based on strong sales of our parasiticides, our key dermatology products and diagnostic portfolio.","Diagnostic revenue from the Abaxis acquisition accounted for 2% of the overall growth. In terms of the livestock, we saw an operational decline of 4%. Growth in poultry was 5% but it was offset by declines in cattle mainly due to lower feedlot placements in the U.S. and the impact of African Swine fever in China.","Our third quarter result demonstrate how our diverse portfolio and focus on meaningful innovations are driving our success. These trends remain the condition of our consistent and long-term performance. In the third quarter, we grew our adjusted net income by 10% operationally.","And we continue to benefited from increase in revenue, improved gross margins and moderate growth in operating expenses. We remain confident in our latest innovation, future pipeline and core business before future growth and deliver our 2019 guidance which Glenn will discuss later.","As we look ahead, we are making good progress with innovations and investment that will generate our future growth. As I said, we are preparing for the launch of Simparica Trio in European markets and Canada at the beginning of next year with the product currently in production.","All regulatory reviews remain underway in Australia, Brazil, and Japan with a further submission expected in China and Mexico. In the U.S., we have been expanding our field force to better support our growing companion animal portfolio including the diagnostic products and in preparation for the launch of Simparica Trio next year once approved.","We also continue to enhance our vaccine portfolios for livestock. In October Zoetis received USDA approval for Poulvac, Procerta, HVT-ND, the companies first vector vaccine for poultry. It will help to protect against both Mareks disease and Newcastle disease, highly contagious and infection for poultry. The product complements our market leading innovative vaccine delivery system for poultry producers and it is the first in what is expected to become an important new global vaccine franchise for Zoetis over the next several years, especially in international markets.","We are also taking important first steps to address African Swine Fever having reached a non-exclusive license agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture in late September. This agreement gives us access to three patents and materials related to African swine fever vaccines strengths that will be incorporated into our research.","While it could take several years to complete the development our licensing of our vaccine, our work with the USDA another partner provides a comprehensive approach to addressing these three infectious diseases.","In addition to new products approval and lifecycle innovations, Zoetis continues to support future growth through business development activities. Last week we announced the acquisition of Phoenix Lab, Seattle based reference laboratory that is highly valued by veterinarians for quality assurance and customer care.","The Zoetis has first entry to the veterinary reference laboratory space and it is expected to further strengthen our overall diagnostic portfolio, building of our 2018 purchase of Abaxis, a leading provider of a point-of-care diagnostic instruments. We view reference labs as another important part of our comprehensive diagnostic offering and we plan to build our presence in reference lab over time to organic expansions and other small acquisitions in this space.","Now I would like to say a few words regarding our leadership transition. As we announced in October, I am retiring at the end of the year. This has been an amazing opportunity to be in a company like Zoetis over the last seven years.","And I feel very positive about the Zoetis future based on our proven strategy, hard and track record of execution, the diverse and innovative portfolio that underlies our success with customers and the growth investment we are making for the long-term.","I am confident our talented colleagues and management team led by our next CEO Kristin Peck will continue to capitalize growth opportunities ahead of Zoetis and create significant value for our company, customers and our shareholders.","Kristin has been with the company since the beginning of Zoetis and currently serve as Zoetis Executive Vice President and Group President of U.S. Operations Business Development and Strategy. I worked with Kristin for many years, I note that she is the right leader for Zoetis next phase of our growth and industry leadership.","She's a strong advocate for our customer needs, a champion offers Zoetis culture and values professional and collaborative leader for our people and industry. The track record of a strong performance through her tenure at Zoetis as well as her operational experience, innovative strategies and deep customer knowledge positions her well to drive Zoetis continued growth. She will build on our long-term study which she felt to develop alongside with the rest of the Zoetis management team and bringing her own vision leading the next stage of Zoetis journey.","I will remain an advisor to Zoetis during the course of 2020 and Kristin and I are already working closely to ensure a smoother transition and maintain the momentum of our business growth.","Before Glenn to discuss our third quarter results, I have asked Kristin to say a few words. Kristin?","Kristin Peck","Thank you, Juan Ramon.","I'm honored to be named the next CEO of Zoetis and I look forward to leading our Company into its next phase of industry leadership and value creation. I want to thank Juan Ramon for establishing Zoetis as the world's leading animal health company. I have deep respect for Juan Ramon and its track record of creating value for our customers and for delivering strong returns for our shareholders. His innovative mindset has kept Zoetis at the forefront of the industry and Juan Ramon confidence in our Company's solid foundation and prospects for continued growth.","So when it has a diverse and innovative portfolio, deep expertise in animal health and a winning culture shared by our talented colleagues around the world. We know how to partner with our customers to address their evolving needs across the continuum of care from prediction and prevention to detection and the treatment of disease. We have a promising pipeline of new products and lifecycle innovations and we are focused on making investments in digital technology, data and analytics that will fuel our future growth.","As CEO, I will continue to drive forward with our successful long-term strategy. I will look for opportunities to accelerate our progress in the most meaningful areas for our veterinary and producer customers and I'm committed to building on the strategies, diverse portfolio and financial discipline that have been critical to our success. To that end, I've been working with Juan Ramon, Glenn and the rest of the Zoetis team as well as the Board over the last few weeks to ensure a seamless transition.","As we look ahead, I continue to view animal health as a very valuable sector for investors. With steady growth prospects as the fundamental macroeconomic drivers of global population growth of innovation and a growing middle class in emerging markets, we'll drive growth in both companion animal and livestock. The long-term history of animal health and Zoetis is the testament to the resiliency of our business.","The drivers in pet care and animal agriculture are fundamental to the world economy. And Core to people's connections with animals for both companionship and nutrition. I'm excited by the new opportunities for raising the standard of care with innovative new medicines, biologics and integrations across the continuum of care.","As I prepare for my new role, a key priority for me has been directly connecting with our stakeholders around the world to better understand their perspective and how we can build on our Company's success. I look forward to engaging with many of you as part of this process and sharing more on our outlook for the market and plans for 2020 early next year.","And now Glenn will cover the financials.","Glenn David","Thank you, Kristin and good morning.","Before discussing our Q3 financial results, I first like to congratulate Juan Ramon on his upcoming retirement and welcome Kristi as the next CEO of Zoetis. In his role as CEO Juan Ramon has led our business to a remarkable transformation from a business unit advisor to an independent and publicly traded industry leader in animal health.","Indeed Revenue and adjusted net income growth, well above the market during that period while managing acquisitions and a significant restructuring and from a personal perspective, he supported me to my own transition to CFO during that time as well.","I'm very thankful to have worked with him over the past decade and appreciate that we will continue to benefit from his insight and knowledge as he remains an advisor & Director on the Board. I'm also very excited to work with Christian as he transitions to her new role, building upon Zoetis a strong foundation and delivering the next phase of growth. Christian and I have worked together at Zoetis for many years and we share our commitment to customers, colleague and value creation which is driven our company's success.","Now let's review the financial results. We delivered another healthy quarter with operational revenue growth of 9% and adjusted net income growth of 10%, these quarterly results which built upon our strong performance for the first half of the year give me confidence in delivering on our full-year improved earnings outlook.","For the full-year we are narrowing operational revenue growth at the high end of the range increasing operational growth for adjusted net income and increasing and narrowing adjusted diluted EPS. Reported revenue growth for the third quarter was 7% including a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was primarily driven by the strengthening of the dollar against the Euro, Argentinian peso and the Australian dollar.","Operational revenue growth of 9% for the quarter is driven by 1% price and 8% volume. The volume contribution of 8% includes 3% from key dermatology products, 2% from new products, 2% from legacy Abaxis products and 1% from other in-line products. Breaking down our operational revenue growth by species, companion animal grew 23% partially offset by livestock declines of 4%.","Companion animal revenue growth was driven by our parasiticides portfolio including new products Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 key dermatology products. the impact of the Abaxis acquisition and growth in emerging markets such as China. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal products grew 20% operationally.","Equine also had strong growth in the quarter benefiting from the acquisition of Platinum Performance, a nutrition focused animal health company. Livestock products declined in the quarter were primarily driven by market weakness in U.S. beef and dairy sectors. The ongoing impact of African Swine Fever and the revenue recovery of the Brazil truck driver strike that increased revenue in Q3 2018. These headwinds were partially offset by growth in poultry.","Our key dermatology portfolio demonstrated continued strength this quarter with sales of $217 million representing 27% operational growth. This is our first quarter with revenue, greater than $200 million. Positive performance in this portfolio was driven by the ongoing expansion of the addressable market, increasing market share and continued uptake of both Apoquel and CYTOPOINT until recently launched markets.","As Juan Ramon mentioned we are clearly on pace to exceed a combined $700 million in revenue this year. New products, especially Revolution Plus and Stronghold Plus as it's known internationally, ProHeart 12 swine combination vaccines 2% to overall growth in the quarter. This growth is net of cannibalization of the original formulations and highlights the success of our investments and lifecycle innovation.","Sales from legacy Abaxis products for $68 million in the quarter represent 10% operational growth over the prior year pro-forma revenue. Other in-line products contributed 1% growth in the quarter including Simparica with $55 million in revenue and 28% operational growth. This growth was partially offset by declines in U.S. cattle and the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever.","Now let's discuss the revenue growth by segment for the quarter. U.S. revenue grew 11% with companion animal growing 26% and livestock declining 9%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, U.S. revenue grew 10%.","Strong companion animal products performance in the quarter were driven by growth of our parasiticide portfolio, key dermatology products and the impact of the Abaxis acquisition. Excluding the impact of legacy Abaxis products, companion animal growth was 25%.","Our parasiticide portfolio including in-line products such as Simparica and ProHeart 6 and new products such as Revolution Plus and ProHeart 12 which launched in the quarter contributed the strong companion animal growth. U.S. dermatology sales were $154 million for the quarter, growing 28%. Growth this quarter was driven by market expansion, increasing market share, returns on direct to consumer investments and price.","Positive companion animal performance was partially offset by U.S. livestock declines in the quarter driven by cattle and to a lesser extent swine. Sales of our cattle products were negatively impacted by unfavorable market conditions in the beef and dairy sectors, while feedlot placements in the quarter impacted sales of our products as well as pricing pressure driven by competition.","While we continue to see good adoption and growth of the Fostera Gold swine vaccine declines in other product sales while it's the lowest swine revenue this quarter primarily due to the timing of promotional activities. These challenges in cattle and swine were partially offset by continued growth in poultry, primarily due to sales of our portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives.","In addition, we were able to capitalize on competitive challenges, including lack of efficacy and supply constraints. To summarize, the U.S. business had a very positive quarter with diversity and innovation driving results despite challenging market conditions in the cattle sector.","Our International segment also contributed to growth this quarter with operational revenue growth of 5%. Companion animal operational revenue growth was 16% while livestock declined 1% operationally.","Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, international revenue grew 4% operationally, companion animal product growth was driven by key dermatology products, the addition of legacy Abaxis products and growth in emerging markets such as China excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition companion animal operational growth was 13%.","International livestock declined modestly primarily due to the impact of African Swine Fever as well as an unfavorable comparison to the prior year which included the revenue recovery from the Brazil truck driver strike. Growth in cattle and poultry, partially offset the declines in swine driven by favorable market conditions in key markets including Mexico, the U.K. and Canada while poultry benefited from increased sales in China, Australia and Brazil.","Now, I would like to review in more detail a few markets in the quarter. Beginning with China, revenue declined 9% operationally driven by the ongoing impact of African Swine Fever which was partially offset by continued double-digit growth in companion animal.","Our livestock portfolio declined 40% operational in China driven by swine declines that were partially offset by growth in poultry and cattle. As we indicated in last quarter, we expect the full-year impact of African Swine Fever to our revenue to be approximately $50 million. While the outbreak has continued to spread to other markets in Southeast Asia, our full-year estimate remains consistent.","In the medium to long term, we continue to anticipate that other regions will increase exports of pork and other proteins however, we have not seen increases in productions to any significant extent. Our companion animal products continue to grow significantly in China increasing 43% operationally. Sales from parasiticides, vaccines and Apoquel were the primary drivers of growth aided by field force expansion and effectiveness.","Moving on to Brazil, sales grew 1% operationally driven by companion animal growth of 17%, partially offset by our livestock decline of 5%. Companion animal revenue growth in Brazil was driven by our key dermatology portfolio including CYTOPOINT which launched in the second quarter as well as growth in Simparica.","Livestock declines in Brazil this quarter were driven by an unfavorable comparison to the prior year when sales were recovered due to the resolution of a national truck drivers' strike that occurred in Q2 of the prior year.","In Mexico, sales grew 22% operationally driven by livestock growth of 15% and companion animal growth of 46%. Livestock benefited from sales of our premium products for cattle while strong companion animal performance was driven by growth in legacy Abaxis products, parasiticides and vaccines.","Other emerging and developed markets also contributed to international growth this quarter, particularly in companion animal driven by parasiticides and key dermatology products. Overall, our International segment continued to perform well, demonstrating the importance of our global diversity and helping to offset the impact of African Swine Fever.","Now moving on to the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 70.1% increased approximately 140 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis compared to the prior year. The increase is driven by foreign exchange, product mix and price partially offset by tariffs on certain products and the inclusion of the lower margin legacy Abaxis portfolio.","Total adjusted operating expenses including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition through 6% operationally. The increase is primarily related to compensation-related expenses and investments to support future growth of the business.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%. The increase from the comparable 2018 period is primarily related to the impact of the global intangible low tax income or GILTI tax which is effective for Zoetis in 2019.","Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter grew 10% operationally and adjusted diluted EPS grew 11% operationally, again, outpacing revenue growth. The combination of revenue growth, improving gross margins and disciplined operating expense growth enabled us to deliver strong bottom line results while still investing strategically for long-term sustainable growth.","Now moving on to guidance for the full-year. As a result of our strong performance in the first nine months of the year, we are narrowing operational revenue growth at the high end of the range, raising operational growth for adjusted net income and raising and narrowing the range for adjusted diluted EPS. Please note that guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October.","I'll now walk you through each of the individual line items, beginning with revenue. We are now expecting to deliver revenue between $6.2 billion and $6.25 billion as compared to our previous range of $6.175 billion to $6.275 billion. The dollar decrease in revenue guidance at the high-end of the range is related to unfavorable foreign exchange. Operational revenue growth is now expected to be between 9% and 10% as compared to our previous estimate of 8.5% to 10% reflecting the continued momentum of our companion animal portfolio.","Our organic operational revenue growth which excludes the impact of Abaxis is now expected to be between 6% and 7%. We are now projecting adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be approximately 30% compared to our previous range of 30% to 31%. Adjusted SG&A for the year is expected to be between $1.525 billion and $1.55 billion compared to our previous range of $1.505 billion to $1.545 billion.","The increase in narrowing at the high-end of the range reflects our focus on critical investments to support revenue growth including promotional activity on key companion animal products. Adjusted R&D expense for 2019 is now expected to be between $445 million and $455 million for the year compared to our previous estimate of $450 million to $465 million. The decrease was related to the timing of project spend.","Our full-year adjusted interest and other income deductions is expected to be approximately $190 million and our full-year adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 20% which are both consistent with previous estimates.","Adjusted net income is now expected to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.745 billion representing an increase of $10 million at the high end of the range. The updated adjusted net income range represents operational growth of 11% to 14% compared to previous range of 9% to 12%. The improved outlook for adjusted net income is primarily driven by gross margin favorability.","We are also increasing our adjusted diluted EPS to a range of $3.57 to $3.62 compared to our previous guidance of $3.53 to $3.60. Our range for reported diluted EPS is increasing and narrowing now expected to be between $2.99 to $3.08 based upon operational increases. Our previously estimated range was $2.93 to $3.04.","We expect approximately $450 million to $475 million in capital expenditures this year with increased investment in information technology and manufacturing to support our Abaxis acquisition, improve cost efficiencies and increased capacity. We anticipate continuing an elevated level for the next few years as we invest in manufacturing and infrastructure to support future growth and product launches.","We also repurchased approximately $450 million of Zoetis shares in the first nine months of the year. We have $1.9 billion remaining under the multi-year share repurchase plan that was approved last year and we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities of internal investment, M&A and returning excess cash to shareholders.","Our guidance for reported and adjusted earnings per share reflects the shares repurchased through the end of Q3. While we not provide guidance for 2020 until February, we view next year as a continuation of strategic investment to support recent and future product launches, our recent acquisitions including Phoenix Lab and Platinum Performance and other strategic priorities.","Now to summarize before we move to Q&A. We have consistently delivered strong top and bottom line growth in the first nine months of the year despite market challenges in cattle and swine. We are narrowing our outlook the operational revenue growth at the high end of the range and we are increasing and narrowing our outlook for adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS reflecting the strong performance year-to-date.","And our investments in R&D, diagnostics integration, manufacturing capabilities and field force expansion will provide a solid platform for continued growth in 2020 and beyond.","Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Juan Ramon, it's been great working with you and I hope you enjoy your retirement and get the play a lot of golf.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you.","Kevin Ellich","Congratulations. We all know you're going to do a terrific job succeeding Juan Ramon. The questions I have first, I think you guys talked about some Simparica Trio saying that your assumption is if it's approved in the U.S. by the end of Q1, revenue would be about $150 million in 2020 did I get that right?","Glenn David","Yes. The incremental sales that we expect for Trio over our existing portfolio is $150 million.","Kevin Ellich","And what is the underlying assumptions there Glenn in terms of pricing, how much will come from the U.S. versus international and how much cannibalization?","Glenn David","So in terms of the breakout between U.S. international like we've set all along, we expect the majority of the sales for this product to be in the U.S. I really want to go into details on price from a competitive perspective at this point but like we said we do expect it to be priced significant premium to Simparica and the cannibalization impact obviously there'll be some cannibalization to Simparica but we also expect to take significant share from competition.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Louise Chen","So Juan Ramon, we will miss you and Kristin and congratulations on the new role. My first question is for you, Kristin, as the new CEO of Zoetis what will you do differently from Juan Ramon? And then also just on 2020, I know you're not giving guidance till February but how should we think about the pushes and pulls as we look into next year? Thank you.","Kristin Peck","Sure. Thanks so much Louise. I'm going to be focused on really continuing the strong path of value creation. If you look at the strategy that we've had over which I feel actually is delivered significant results both for our customers and for our shareholders. It is been a dynamic strategy that has always been predicated on continuous innovation and disruption which I think is really would have helped us stand out.","It's also been characterized by a great diversity of our portfolio and my goal is to maintain that strong momentum to stay ahead of competitors. I think if I look into 2020 and 2021 and beyond, I'm really going to be focused on innovation, making sure we continue to bring to market products that really solve both our customers and animals\u2019 challenges.","I will continue to relentless focus on our customer making sure that we're finding ways to make their job easier to do and to make them more productive. And I'll be looking for better leverage our digital and data both to make us more efficiently internally as well as to drive better productivity and greater growth in some of our data and digital revenue products both in diagnostics and precision livestock farming. So that will be my focus as we look into 2020 and some of the sources of where I think you'll see our continued growth.","Glenn David","And in terms of the pushes and pulls for 2020, starting with the revenue line, where we continue to see good momentum in our companion animal business and particularly with the expected launch of Simparica Trio subject to approval, we expect to see very strong performance there as well as the continued growth in some of the new products that we launched this year such as ProHeart 12 and Revolution Plus.","Also, when you take into account the impact of African Swine Fever that we had this year, we would expect that to stabilize this year and not to be a negative detractor to growth in 2020 so that should benefit us as well. When we look at the expenses, obviously there'll be some investments to support our new product launches.","We want to make sure that we get those products off to a strong start and also some investments to support the recent acquisitions that we have in place. So overall, we would expect revenue to grow faster than the market again in 2020 and we would expect that we able to grow our income faster than revenue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks and Kristin congrats, Juan Ramon as well. It's obviously been very, very nice working with you. I had a quick question on Simparica Trio - $150 million in 2020, it's a little bit higher I guess than what we were contemplating on a net basis, I just want to confirm some of the assumptions that you're making, does it assume that you launch ahead of ZeoMAX and does it assume that you'll be the only player in the U.S. and does it also assume of puppy indication or other label caveats from a safety perspective. A separate question here, but can you also speak to the diagnostic strategy in the reference laboratory market. I guess how quickly can you scale up the U.S. lab footprint and what are some of your plans internationally from a reference lab perspective as well? Thanks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","So, Kristin will answer all this question, so please Kristin.","Kristin Peck","Sure, so starting with Trio. We do not expect to be launching ahead of ZeoMAX and Western vet but we do expect to be launching ahead, a very important Q2, Q3 parasiticides season. So I think we will not be there but I do think if you look at the $150 million to your point, we still expect to deliver a very strong year there.","We do expect to get puppy claim that is part of the assumptions that is in there that's obviously subject to back to approval but that is our going in assumption as we look at that. So as I move towards the reference lab, we continue to believe that diagnostics is an important part of our go-forward portfolio.","It is critical to that and as a part of their business that will stay there, we think it enhances as Zoetis is currently value proposition and is a great complement to our existing portfolio, it's a large and very fast growing market. As the market has been growing at 10% plus, we strongly believe that we can accommodate a third player.","We've also known the customers that we're looking for a third-party alternative and if you look and different MSAs shares of third-parties have actually been significant as our acquisition of Phoenix demonstrates, they had over 50% share in the MSA they operated in. Our plan in this space is to invest both organically and inorganically over the next few years and we remain committed to the space.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott","Great, thanks very much for the question. I guess my first one was on Apoquel and CYTOPOINT ex-U.S., can you just provide any additional color in terms of where penetration rate stand in some of the bigger markets in terms of Europe, Brazil, et cetera and where do you think those penetration rates can go over the next several years? And my second question is, sorry I keep going back to $150 number but I'm still not quite clear, can you help me understand again how much of that 150 is incremental revenue on top of what you're parasiticide business is already doing as compared to erosion from I guess legacy Simparica and some of your heart products et cetera. I'm trying to understand the magnitude of overall growth I should be thinking about for parasiticides next year. Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Glenn will provide some data related to the penetration range and also details of the 150, how much is [indiscernible] revenues.","Glenn David","So when you look at Apoquel and CYTOPOINT particularly in the U.S., we see that we are plus 60% share in that market. The data internationally is not as clear in terms of, we don't get the same level of data but we know we're not at that penetration rate. Also we've launched Cytopoint later international than we do in the U.S. so we do think we have continued uptake there.","So we do see significant opportunities in international if you continue to gain share as we move up to similar levels that we have in the U.S. We also see continued opportunities in the U.S. as we continue to expand that market and raise disease awareness of dermatology and atopic dermatitis. So we see continued opportunity in the U.S. as well.","In terms of $150 million revenue for Simparica Trio, I want to be clear that is incremental sales overall what we see for Simparica alone and that does include the cannibalization effect. So we would expect greater sales of Trio then $150 million as a stand-alone product.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Ryskin","And I want to mirror the earlier comments, congrats Juan Ramon. It's been great working with you and Kristin look forward to working with you going forward. Two quick questions from me, one on some of the moving pieces in the quarter and sort of looking forward, I would say one of the bigger surprises this year has been in the entire market not just very specifically but some of the challenges in U.S. livestock, particularly given the negative tone of ASF internationally, there is an expectation that you will see some stabilization in U.S. livestock in the market in cattle and swine.","And it's been a little bit slow probably slower expected this year, if you look back in the line months earlier. How do you see some of these dynamics playing out? We talked about ASF internationally but if you think about the cattle herd in the U.S., some of the feedlot pressures that we've seen this year in terms of placements, if you could talk automatically sort of over that six months to 12-months.","And then a quick follow-up on the seasonality question, you talked about the Simparica Trio approval likely end of 1Q early 2Q launch, could you talk about the timing that you think about the vet purchasing a lot of the ordering by that's happens relatively early in the year. So how much wiggle room do you have built-in and how quickly can you ramp up manufacturing to make sure that you don't miss a fleas season if there is a month or two movement either way there.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Let me answer the question on Simparica Trio and then Kristin will cover the trends and also the challenge that we have seen in the U.S. livestock and we also talked about the African Swine Fever. We expected approval in late first quarter from FDA and then shortly after we launched the product in the market. We are thinking already they are prepared to step to ensure ample supply of the product as soon as we obtain approval in the U.S.","So we don't think that the supply will be efficient in terms of capturing the opportunities of the high season that it's mainly in the Q2 following the Q3. We are confident that we told earlier we are making now it is probably is approved by the FDA, we will be able to generate a significant opportunity for Simparica as we are in 2020.","So moving into the U.S. livestock, Kristin?","Kristin Peck","Sure. As you saw our numbers both dairy and beef in the U.S. continue to be weak. As we said in previous conversations in previous quarters, we expect this to continue for the rest of the year. From a dairy perspective and we've seen depressed milk prices versus historical trends which has limited producer profitability income and in the last few months there has been a small improvement in pricing but it's not yet sustained enough we believe for producers to believe recovery M&A and to start investing significantly.","On the beef side, we're at the end of what's been a very long expansion period. So we are expecting a little bit of contraction or flattening out over the medium term. As you look at beef, there has also been a lack of innovation that has driven significant pricing and competitive pressures.","We had a wet spring which had good past through this year which is kept cattle out longer and as you've seen there's been a significant increase in some of those prices and live cattle prices, which has encouraged them to wait of their animals were heavier and older to put them in the feedlot.","So as we look at U.S. cattle, I think we'll continue to see challenges of there as we look into next year. And as we look at ASF as we've spoken about previously, we believe with China specifically, we see about a $50 million impact across the Zoetis primarily based out of China. As we look into next year, we are hoping for that to stabilize and we are hoping to see some recovery moderate but obviously that remains to be seen based on how that goes. But we do see offsets were the Chinese swine.","We are expecting imports from EU, Brazil and the U.S. both in swine as well as across other proteins to help compensate that we've seen significant price increases in pork globally. We see Brazil and EU probably best positioned to take some of this, but I think overall, it seems certainly enough in the U.S., the U.S. will also go after trying to get a greater share of. So we remain quite committed but I think what we believe that the impact of ASF should flatten out as we look into next year. So hopefully that explains.","Operator","We will go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jon Kaufman","This is Jon Kaufman on for Kreger. Juan Ramon, we wish you well and Kristin congrats on the new role. One of your competitors has talked a lot recently about the importance of alternative channels. Can you guys talk a little bit about that? How important are the online and the mass market retail channels for you today? How has your strategy evolved here over the past year or so and as you think about the future outlook for the company, how much of the growth, do you think will come from these alternative channels? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","We have seen Jon the changes on the how vet owners are getting that product from different channels, we have seen that mainly the U.S., but also in some other markets there are changes but really having an impact into the veterinary space but Kristin will provide much more color on how things are changing in the U.S. as these affecting the market, affecting manufacturers, affecting alternative channels, so Kristin do you want to provide some comments please?","Kristin Peck","Sure. I would certainly. If you look at our portfolio is the contrast of other is the majority of what we sell requires a prescription. So our goal is to work with vet to make our product available to pet owners in a way that works best for them.","And what we've seen is in the areas such as parasiticides and chronic medications, many pet owners have looked more to buy their products from e-commerce and retail and as such we've evolved our own strategy to work more directly with e-commerce and retail. We implemented as we discussed on previous calls the minimum advertised price or Matt pricing which is an agreement with all e-commerce and retailers to ensure that they cannot advertise our products beyond a certain price.","This has allowed us to legitimately sell our product, eliminate some of the great market and provide veterinarians and pet owners the convenience to fill their prescriptions where and how they want. This I think is an evolving thing so just to give you context still 50% of what we sell we'll have to remain no matter what in the clinic.","It's definitely expanding quickly but still on a relative basis is still a small part of our business today, but something we're monitoring closely and we're making sure that we continue to develop and enhance our capabilities to best serve this new channel as we move forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jon Block","And maybe just a handful of small questions most of is clarification. So first clarification for companion animal, did you guys see both canine and theme line labs both targeting U.S. approval in 2021 one, a clarification for ASF I was a little mixed up there is the thought that the drag for 2020 will be less than the $50 million incremental hit in '19 but you still think there could be additional incremental headwinds for 2020?","And then lastly, Glenn, not going into 2020 guidance on you but just only we think about that COGS in sort of hitting that 70% bogey for 2019 which is certainly impressive. I would think you still going to have a favorable mix shift in 2020 is companion grows faster than livestock based on all the commentary but do somebody investments in manufacturing offset that. Thanks guys.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, John. Let me confirm that we have to file both antibodies for cats and dogs in EU and the U.S. and we expect to launch in 2021 of these two products in the U.S. Moving into the African Swine Fever, the assumption that we are making on the comments that we provided today is we are assuming that there will not be a further spreading of African Swine Fever outside of China.","We have seen that cases in the Southeast Asia, Korea, the Philippines to a lesser extent also in Eastern European markets. But we expect that customers now are improving that vital security and they are protecting better against the African Swine Fever.","We are not expecting that China to continue growing in terms of cases may be an opportunity to slight increase in production in China and definitely we see the opportunity in other markets to compensate the gap that have in terms of supply of meat into the Chinese population with more production from Brazil, European markets, Spain, Germany and some other markets, Canada and the U.S. and this is something that in our opinion will help also to generate that growth in livestock in 2020.","So moving into the third question, in terms of gross profit Glenn, you want to cover that?","Glenn David","Yes, so John your thoughts on gross margin. When you look into 2020 there should definitely be a favorable mix impact as we would still expect companion animal to grow faster than livestock in 2020. Just one thing to note on that Trio being the first year of product launch will not be as favorable to gross margin as the rest of the companion animal portfolio we typically be. Over time we do expect that product to have very favorable margin.","But with the first year of launch there is always learnings and efficiencies that will be delivered over time. The other thing to take into account is that FX had a very positive impact in 2019 our overall gross margin. We would not expect it to be positive in 2019 probably be somewhat of a detractor in 2012.","Operator","We'll go next to David Westenberg with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","David Westenberg","I echo the congratulations. So just in terms of market sizing up, can you help us size the market for the cat opportunity given that there is no existing market? just any sort of framework so that we can think about in terms of there would be population age, et cetera.","And then secondly, a competitor called out the ASA-African Swine Fever vaccine market is a multi-billion dollar market. Can you maybe give us a framework on the size of that as well? Do you agree with that assessment? What are the puts and takes there? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Okay, so let's me provide some comments on the market size for cat and local antibodies. So first, there is no any specific product today in the market developed specifically for cat. We know that the number of cats, it's lower than the number of dogs and even more the number of medicalized cats it's even lower than the number of medicalized dogs in the U.S. and also worldwide. If I compare the market of dogs in terms of managing their pain it's about $400 million to $500 million worldwide.","So with the comments I made in terms of medicalization rates and the number of cats, you should expect that the market potential for cat in pain is lower than these $400 million to $500 million. But the advantage is that we will be entering into a space that there is no any clear product addressing that pain in dogs and that we think that we can generate a significant growth opportunity in these areas.","Then how big is the African Swine Fever market? Well, I don't know if the question is related of how much has been the impact on the African Swine Fever and the vaccine. Well, I think it's something that it is reaching because definitely we see a significant opportunity in China, developing this vaccine but also not only in China that we have already the disease but also, they need to protect African Swine Fever in other markets.","We are convinced that this can be one of the top vaccine products worldwide, more than FMB or even more than PCV2. So the opportunity for developing a vaccine in this area is significant.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","And me please add my congrats to you both Juan Ramon and Kristin. So my two questions are first, with respect to U.S. tick, could you help us understand what percentage of the U.S. dog market needs tick coverage. Obviously, there are no ticks in the south, I just don't know what percentage of dogs reside in tick infested areas in the country? And then second, could you comment on livestock pipeline launch opportunities in the next year or so? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you, David, Kristin?","Kristin Peck","Sure. If you look at, U.S. tick average, very significant tick coverage across the United States. There are different ticks. In the South, you might see more of a Gulf Coast tick which is actually a very difficult tick to treat [indiscernible] tick in the North. So we do believe that most pets in the United States needs a comprehensive tick protection. There may be some geography where there's not a lot but I think there may varies a tick but insect protection is critical we move across the U.S.","As we think about our livestock population opportunity, as you saw in the press release, we are quite focused on driving innovation across livestock. We announced a partnership with Colorado State. So look at antibiotic alternative to the livestock space. We're also really focused on immuno therapies in livestock as alternatives to antibiotics and are excited about some projects there as well.","We're also looking at precision livestock farming can make producers more productive and to better predict animal looking sick. We are also excited in the area of genetics where we can breed healthier animals that are also more productive. And as we've talked about in previous calls looking through diagnostics to bring more shoot side farm side diagnostics across that.","Operator","We'll go next to Mavin Jacobs with UBS. Please go ahead.","Prakhar Agarwal","This is Prakhar on for Mavin. I had two questions. First on Simparica Trio, one thing we are hoping to get more clarity on is around duration of therapy, so tick free products are more seasonal which is not typically the case with hard one product. So how are you thinking about the duration of therapy for Simparica Trio? Do you expect this to be predominantly used in the tick season or good duration of therapy, be more? And secondly on Abaxis you've talked about expansion into OES markets are the key opportunity so could you provide an update on the expansion plan and have you identified target markets or regions that might be ideal and longer term could Abaxis reach similar size in international markets and the U.S. market. Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you very much for the two questions. So let me answer the duration of therapy. One thing is that what should be the duration of therapy that we believe that it should be in many of the markets are 12 months. And what is the actual duration of therapy that is probably three or less month. So a significant opportunity in terms of compliance and we may see some high season for ticks and fleas depending on the warmer weather but they need to protect animals goes going across the year and definitely in the case of a high warm, it's a 12-month the need of protecting against these type of disease.","And I like Kristin to talk about our budgeted rate expansion plans both U.S. and international.","Kristin Peck","Sure. When we announced back since there, we talked a lot about the fact that we think we can continue to operate the business in the U.S. much better and drive more efficiencies and drive growth but acknowledged that the competition in the U.S. is a little steeper. As we look into international, we strongly believe in international, there are significant growth opportunities. It's more of a blue ocean with a much more fragmented base. The use of diagnostics also varies dramatically by market.","We're very focused on and building our own direct demand generation field force which is really being lacking across most companies, the operator international we looked at 2019, as we've talked about for Abaxis as a platform year to really establish ourselves there and we plan to move to direct distribution from some of our existing distributors across most markets as we look into 2020.","So we do think there is a significant opportunity in Abaxis to reach us by a similar if not higher share than we have in the U.S. just given it is a less mature market with much more fragmentation but it will require a market by market approach.","Operator","We'll go next to Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Nathan Rich","Thanks for the questions and let me also offer my congratulations. On the triple combo, have you guys gotten feedback from the FDA just on where they are in their review process and kind of what is driving your expectations for maybe a little bit later of an approval than you originally expected. And then can you also talk about the timing for a submission. And when you would expect approval for the triple combo in China and some of the other geographies that you mentioned like Mexico?","Juan Ramon Alaix","Let me make some comments about the process of approval in the U.S. There is something which is part of the normal process of questions and answers. We get there some additional requests for information from FDA, not related to safety or efficacy and we already answered these questions and now we are waiting for the feedback and we expect the final decision on Simparica Trio by late first quarter next year. But there is something that is part of a regulatory discussion with many of the regulatory authorities across the globe. We said before that we were expecting approval and launch in the first quarter.","We have already obtained approval in Europe and Canada and we have the first quarter in these markets. And we'll be ready for launching shortly after approval in the U.S. And as I said, we are already taking the steps to have ample supply to meet the market needs in the 2020 always base with the assumption that we provided that today of these 150 additional revenues in Simparica sale.","And then you also ask about approval time in China. These unfortunately something that at this point, it's difficult to answer. We are preparing the filing in China and then after the filing probably we will get a little bit more clarity on the timing and we expect that to launching in this market.","So first we intend to launch Simparica as a single item in China and then also CYTOPOINT that is another important product that we plan also to launch in China and then later we'll be launching Simparica Trio. So even if it will take maybe some years, we have products that are coming into the market in China that will generate very positive growth momentum in this market. Next question please.","Operator","Our next question is from Kathy Miner with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Kathy Miner","First again Juan Ramon and Kristin congratulations to you both. Just a couple of questions, first on the canine pain map that you filed. Can you tell us if that is the compound that you acquired from Nexvet a couple of years ago? Second, I noticed that fish sales were down 9% this quarter and that's somewhat unusual that's been a growing market. Is that something temporary or is there a change in the outlook? And last question when we look at African Swine Fever, I think it took everyone by surprise, are there any other diseases that you're monitoring that could impact your business over the next three to five years? Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you for the question. So let me start with answering the question about the monoclonal antibody for dogs. So we have multiple programs in our R&D activity. The product that we are now planning to launch it's an internal product for dogs. The one that we are planning to launch for cat is coming from Nexvet. You also asked about the decline in the quarter related to fish.","We have been growing very fast in previous years in fish. This year we had some challenge related to the PD vaccine in Norway. We expect that it is a temporary adjustment and we expect fish to continue growing faster than the overall animal health market. The long-term opportunities in fish is related to adding new vaccines to protect all species different than salmon. Today, we have most of our revenues concentrated in salmon in Norway and Chile.","But we expect to continue developing new vaccines to protect animals different than the salmon and to review the use of antibiotic which is today the only treatment or the only protection against infections for species like the gases or tilapia or other fish. Definitely, we continue investing in fish and we are confident that fish will be a growing opportunity in the future. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Gregg Gilbert","A couple longer term ones for Kristin and clearly Zoetis is the leader overall industry but is there an area or areas we'd like to see is they want us be more of a leader than it is today. And secondly on the companion side do you think pet owners they are anywhere close the maxing out and what they can afford or where they chose to afford in carrying for their pets, I realize flees, ticks heart worm is not in this category. But thinking the three to five years plus on the line we spent biotech products, et cetera. Maybe this comment on that longer term. Thank you.","Juan Ramon Alaix","So let me answer the first question and then Kristin will cover the second. So when we see that we can improve our market share and becoming the leader and becoming leader and, in this call, we announced that we obtain approval of new vaccine for both which is related to vector technology it's an area that we believe that will be a growing opportunity.","So I think we are starting that with one vaccine but the objective is to develop a complete set of vector vaccine to cover multiple diseases in totally and this will help us and also to maximize the opportunities with our leadership in lower vaccination which is the machine that is used in country to protect chicken before hatchery.","So we are injecting X and we see an area in where we are less share that the overall share that this area has. The second area in where we think that we have been improving significantly is the launch of Simparica followed by the launch of Revolution Plus, ProHeart 12 it's parasiticides and we expect also with the launch of Simparica Trio to become much stronger leader in parasiticides than today. Kristin?","Kristin Peck","Sure, on you second question. We've seen as increases over the last few years and the spend per pet, I think a lot of that has to do with the demographic shifts in developed markets where people are having fewer children, spending more time with their pets, Millennials in particular are much more engaged with their pets. And we've spoken about the increase in pet spending start when they move from the backyard to your house and then ultimately to your bed. So we don't see any end in this market. It's been a very resilient business even in times of economic challenges people have continue to spend on their pets.","So we don't see right now any indicators that that spending per pet will be going down. So I think it remains a strong market as we look to the future and if you look at the urbanization and the emerging middle class and emerging market, we see significant growth there as you add more markets that keep more pets and medicalized like that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","So one quick one, thinking about African Swine Fever in a different way, down the road when it's time to re-populate the herd, just wondering how much benefit that could bring to Zoetis especially given your presence in genomics and genetics?","Kristin Peck","Sure. If you look at repopulation I mean essentially in China and some of these other geographies will repopulate. We believe when they do more move more to industrialized production and more away from the small backyard farms. We think that does play to the strength of innovative companies like Zoetis so we do see the future of African Swine Fever as it goes down meeting, more technologically based production which we think it will be an increase for us and certainly if we're able to create a vaccine for African Swine Fever that will be even more in picture.","Operator","And there appears to be no further questions, I'll return the floor to Juan Ramon for closing remarks.","Juan Ramon Alaix","Thank you very much and since this will be my last earnings call, I want to thank you all of you for the support you have given to me and Zoetis over the last seven years. It has been an amazing journey and I'm very proud of the value that we have been created. I know that you will enjoy the same ongoing commitment to our valuable provision from Kristin, Glenn and the rest of our leadership team and the data as I think into the next phase of growth.","In closing, I remain confident in a brighter future of Zoetis.

[Operator Instructions]","It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Steve Frank. Steve, you may begin.","Steve Frank","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Zoetis fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. I am joined today by Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix, our Chief Executive Officer; and Glenn David, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'll remind you that the slides presented on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website and that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, that actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements in today's press release and our SEC filings, including but not limited to our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our reports on Form 10-Q.","Our remarks today will also include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures is included in the financial tables that accompany our earnings press release and in the Company's 8-K filing dated today, February 14, 2019. We also cite operational results, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange.","With that, I will turn the call over to Juan Ram\u00f3n.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our 2018 results once again confirm the strength of our business and our leadership in the animal health industry. We delivered another year of strong performance and executed on investment plans to continue to strengthen our portfolio across the continuum of care.","Our successful innovations, the high quality of our manufacturing, our best-in-class field force and the diversity of our portfolio has been driving our steady revenue growth over the years. Since we became a public company in 2013, we have consistently grown revenue faster than the market and this revenue performance has been achieved, while significantly improving our profitability, with our adjusted EBIT margin, increasing from 24% in 2013 to 35% in 2018.","In 2018, we delivered our sixth consecutive year of operational revenue growth, 10% overall, with organic operational growth of 8%, which excludes the revenue related to our Abaxis acquisition. In terms of organic revenue drivers, we achieved our strongest growth in our dermatology portfolio, vaccines and parasiticides.","Meanwhile, our anti-infective and medicated feed additives show modest growth and this was because of regulatory changes around the use of antibiotics in animal products. For the second year in a row, our broad base of about 300 product lines generated operational revenue growth across all our core species and major markets.","We expect our 2018 organic growth to once again outperform the market and deliver our value proposition of growing in line with or faster than the animal health market. We also increased profitability faster than revenue growth for the full-year, growing adjusted net income by 31% on operational basis, consistent with our value proposition. This improvement was driven by higher revenue, improved cost structure and tax reform.","In 2018, we achieved other important milestones that will support our future growth and success. Apoquel, our largest product by revenue, achieved $464 million in sales in 2018, an increase of 28% from 2017. We added two new blockbusters to our portfolio in 2018, bringing our total number of products with more than $100 million in annual sales to 12.","Our oral parasiticide Simparica and our monoclonal antibody or dermatology Cytopoint, each exceeded $100 million in sales for the first time, with $158 million and $129 million in annual sales, respectively. We also introduced critical new lifecycle innovations that keep our portfolio updated and competitive and support the durability of our major global franchises.","For example, Fostera Gold PCV MH, our latest swine vaccine was introduced in the U.S. and Canada to provide greater options and flexibility in protecting pigs from diseases. We also built on the sarolaner compound in Simparica to develop Revolution Plus, a topical parasiticide for cats that was recently approved in the U.S., Japan and Canada, combines two ingredients, sarolaner and selamectin, and it\u2019s already marketed in the European Union as Stronghold Plus.","All these new products and lifecycle innovations demonstrate the actual return on our investments in R&D. We also took important steps to expand our manufacturing capacity. In the U.S., we enlarged our production facility for poultry vaccines in Charles City, Iowa and our expansion in Kalamazoo, Michigan is progressing ahead of schedule. With the first commercial batches of oral solid dose medicines expected to be delivered to customers by the middle of 2019.","Outside the U.S., we expect to complete the construction of our vaccine manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China by the end of 2019. And we acquired a facility in Tallaght, Ireland, to help increase the supply of our market leading bovine sealants that help protect cows from mastitis infections.","During the year, we made our largest acquisition to date purchasing Abaxis for $2 billion in the fast growing point-of-care diagnostics space. We see diagnostics as an important area to growing our portfolio and with a tremendous growth opportunity ahead, especially in international markets.","We also acquired Smartbow, where it's sensor technology and monitoring systems, which will be essential to our expansion in precision livestock farming, and other digital and data analytic solutions that are emerging in animal health. And we returned excess capital to our shareholders. In December, we announced a $2 billion multi-year share repurchase program and the increase of our quarterly dividend by 30%.","Looking ahead in 2019, we will continue investing to generate short and long-term growth. We'll support our key dermatology and parasiticide products with direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional campaigns, through advanced penetration and launches in new markets.","In the U.S., we'll be launching two new products in our companion animal business. Revolution Plus, the topical parasiticide for cats that I mentioned before, has launched this quarter, and pending FDA approval this year, we would expect to launch a new injectable formulation to protect dogs against heartworms for up to 12 months.","In terms of R&D, our pipeline remains very strong and we expect to see more progress in 2019. Potential filings for new products and continued market expansions of major products like Cytopoint, Simparica, and Apoquel, which is expected to launch in China this year.","In 2019, we'll continue our work on new monoclonal antibodies to manage pain in dogs and cats, as well as for dermatology in cats. We are making good progress with our research products and we feel very positive about the potential these type of treatments offer for greater compliance, convenience and efficacy for different species. This remain an area to watch as we invest further internally and we build on our partnership with Regeneron in this space.","As I have mentioned in previous communications, the application for our new three-way combination parasiticides, composed of Simparica and two other active ingredients, has been filed in the U.S. and with European Medicines Agency, and if approved, we still anticipate coming to market in 2020.","Additionally, we'll be investing more in research for diagnostics, devices, digital and data analytics technologies that can be integrated with our core portfolio of medicines and vaccines. Diagnostics for livestock has a promising long-term opportunity, and areas such as sensor technology, monitoring systems and other digital application for animal health will be receiving more investment.","In terms of our deeper commitment to diagnostics, we look forward to a full-year of selling a more robust portfolio of point-of-care diagnostic instruments, consumables and test kits. We are seeing a great progress with integration of the legacy Abaxis that's imposed in the U.S. And outside the U.S., we are building the infrastructure, sales and technical teams needed to support our diagnostic portfolio.","Moving to market creation for 2019. We expect the overall industry to grow approximately 5%, excluding the impact of foreign currency. The swine market, companion animal market and poultry are all expected to be somewhat in line with the market growth. The cattle market growth is expected to be more limited based on the challenging market conditions for beef and dairy customers.","For Zoetis, we expect to grow faster in the market for companion animal and swine based on our new products and to grow in line with the poultry and cattle market. We announced our full-year 2019 guidance today and we are expecting organic operational revenue growth of 4.5% to 6.5%, excluding a three percentage point contribution from Abaxis.","Operational growth for adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of 8% to 11%. In 2019, we are committed to invest in net profits to generate short and long-term growth while returning excess capital to shareholders.","In conclusion, our strong performance in 2018 is based on our diverse portfolio, our leadership innovation and customer experience across the entire cycle of care. In 2018, we have invested to support the growth of our core business as well as evolve in spaces like diagnostics, devices, digital and data analytics. We expect to build on this strategic approach to our growth in 2019 while delivering on the full-year guidance.","With that, let me hand things over to Glenn, who will provide more details on our 2018 fourth quarter results and full-year 2019 guidance.","Glenn David","Thank you, Juan Ram\u00f3n, and good morning, everyone. As Juan Ram\u00f3n noted, we had another exceptional year in 2018 with strong performance in both revenue and adjusted net income. Revenue exceeded our guidance and adjusted net income was in line with the high-end of our range.","We expect our 2018 organic growth to again outperform the market once industry figures are finalized, delivering on our value proposition of organically growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue.","Revenue for the full-year 2018 was $5.8 billion with both reported and operational revenue growth for the year at 10%. Excluding the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, operational growth for 2018 was 8%. Of this 8%, 3% comes from price and 5% from volume.","Included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2%, new products, including Simparica of 2% and in line products of 1%. Adjusted net income for the full-year was $1.5 billion, representing reported growth of 29% and operational growth of 31%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin improvement and a lower effective tax rate.","In 2018, we grew our business operationally, across all core species, therapeutic areas and major markets. Our key dermatology portfolio and Simparica continued to grow and gained additional market share, both in the U.S. and international. For the full-year, we recognized combined revenue of $593 million for Apoquel and Cytopoint. This portfolio continued to grow rapidly in 2018 and is well positioned for future growth heading into 2019.","For livestock, our diverse portfolio of products drove growth across both developed and emerging markets capitalizing on industry trends of higher protein consumption and improved productivity.","Turning to the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth was 7%, which includes a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Currency depreciation in Brazil continued to be the largest driver of the unfavorable foreign exchange impact in the quarter.","Operational revenue growth in the quarter was 11%. Excluding the impact of Abaxis acquisition, operational revenue growth was 7%. Of this 7%, 3% comes from price and 4% from volume. Included in the volume growth are contributions from our key dermatology portfolio of 2% and new products including Simparica of 2%.","Q4 represents the first full quarter of Abaxis-related revenue being included in Zoetis results. We recognized $65 million from legacy Abaxis products contributing 4% growth to overall Zoetis in Q4. These results included destocking of wholesaler inventories in U.S. as we normalized wholesaler inventory levels to be consistent with the rest of our business.","New products, including Simparica, Stronghold Plus and PCV combo vaccine were also growth drivers in the quarter. Simparica generated $32 million in global sales this quarter representing operational growth of 90% over last year. Equine's CORE EQ Innovator, the first and only vaccine to contain all five core equine disease antigen also launched in 2018 and it helped to drive operational revenue growth of 12% in equine for the quarter.","Our key dermatology portfolio, comprised of Apoquel and Cytopoint, also continued strong performance this quarter with sales of $156 million, a 25% increase over the prior year. Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21% operationally driven by revenue growth, discrete other income items and a lower effective tax rate.","Now let's discuss Zoetis segment revenues for Q4. Beginning with the U.S., revenue grew 14% in the fourth quarter, including 6% growth due to legacy Abaxis products. Including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal grew 26%, while livestock grew 3%.","Companion animal sales in the quarter were driven by sales of legacy Abaxis products, our key dermatology portfolio and new products, including Simparica. Certain in-line products decline due to competitive pressure partially offset these increases.","Excluding the impact from the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal growth was 14%. Key dermatology sales were $110 million for the quarter with both Apoquel and Cytopoint exhibiting significant growth over the prior year. Simparica also had another positive quarter with U.S. sales in the quarter, nearly doubling over the last year.","Revenue growth continued due to increased clinic penetration and market share resulting from our field force selling efforts. Partially offsetting growth in our companion animal business were declines in RIMADYL and CLAVAMOX due to anticipated competition. The U.S. livestock business delivered growth across all species in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, this growth comes off a strong fourth quarter in 2017.","In the cattle business, we continued to see challenges in both the beef and dairy segments. However, growth was primarily due to higher sales of premium products as well as competitive supply constraints in the quarter. In poultry, the Zoetis portfolio of alternatives to antibiotics in medicated feed additives, continued to be a solid contributor to growth as we saw additional market expansion of no antibiotics ever production. Overall, the U.S. demonstrated another strong quarter with growth across all species.","Turning now to our International segment. Revenue grew 5% operationally in the fourth quarter, including 1% growth due to Abaxis legacy products. Including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, companion animal operational growth was 14% and operational growth in livestock was 2%. As a reminder, international markets faced a headwind of four fewer calendar days this quarter resulting from the change in our accounting calendar implemented this year.","Full-year operational revenue growth of 9% was not impacted by calendar days and provides a more accurate indicator of international performance. Companion animal product growth was driven by the addition of legacy Abaxis products, new products such as Simparica and Stronghold Plus, our key dermatology products and increased medicalization rates in key international markets.","Livestock growth was driven by poultry, swine and fish, while cattle was relatively flat in the quarter. The complete quarter and annual results of our top 11 international markets are provided in the table included in our earnings release, but I would like to highlight a few items for the quarter.","In Brazil, sales grew 8% operationally with companion animal growing 22% and livestock growing 4%. Companion animal revenue in Brazil benefited from growth in vaccines due to improved supply and key products primarily Simparica and Apoquel. Livestock benefited from damp weather condition, which increased the use of cattle parasiticides as well as expanded usage plan on vaccines, which helped drive premium pricing.","Moving onto China, we had another great quarter growing revenue 16% operationally, largely due to continued growth of companion animal products, primarily vaccines and parasiticides. Canada grew 10% operationally with balanced growth between companion animal and livestock.","Companion animal growth was driven by the inclusion of Abaxis legacy products as well as growth in Apoquel. Livestock benefited from sales of new products and swine and strong performance of key brands and cattle. Other emerging markets also performed well in the quarter.","Summarizing International performance. The addition of Abaxis legacy product, continued growth of new products and diversity across our portfolio, all contributed to another solid quarter for our International segment, despite the impact of fewer calendar days.","Now moving onto the rest of the P&L. Adjusted gross margin of 66.4% decreased approximately 250 basis points in the quarter on a reported basis versus the prior year. The decline this quarter is primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, a full quarter of Abaxis related revenue included in our results and increased inventory charges.","The declines are partially offset by strong revenue growth and continued cost improvements and efficiencies in our manufacturing network. The Q4 margin is not indicative of the gross margin we anticipate going forward.","Total adjusted operating expenses, including the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, grew 15% operationally. The increase is primarily related to the acquisition of Abaxis and additional spend in R&D, including investments in monoclonal antibody for chronic pain and other pipeline programs.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. This tax rate is significantly lower than the rate from the comparable 2017 period due to the favorable impact of U.S., tax reform and discrete items recognized during the quarter.","Adjusted net income for the quarter grew 21% operationally through a combination of strong revenue growth, favorability in other income and a lower effective tax rate. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 25% operationally in the quarter versus the same period of 2017.","Our income growth and balance sheet discipline have enabled us to continue increasing operating cash flow. Inventory improvements are one area I'm particularly pleased with, having decreased months on hand since 2016 by more than two months. The current level of less than nine months on hand is consistent with industry standards and we expect we will continue around this level going forward. The significant improvement in inventory has released approximately $300 million of cash from our balance sheet since 2016.","Now moving to guidance for 2019. We are committed to our value proposition of growing revenue in line with or faster than the market and growing adjusted net income faster than revenue. Before I get into the specific numbers, please note that you can find our guidance table included in the press release as well as the investor slides. Also note that all foreign exchange impact is based upon exchange rates as of late January.","In 2019, we are projecting revenue between $6.175 billion and $6.3 billion, reflecting operational revenue growth of 7.5% to 9.5% over 2018. Foreign exchange is expected to reduce revenue growth by approximately 1.5%. Our organic operational revenue growth, which excludes the impact of the Abaxis acquisition, is projected to be between 4.5% to 6.5%.","In addition to Abaxis legacy products, our key dermatology portfolio and new products will be strong contributors to growth in 2019. From a species perspective, we expect companion animal to grow to faster rate than livestock, driven by the Abaxis acquisition, continued growth in our key dermatology and parasiticide portfolios, increased medicalization rates in emerging markets and market dynamics, including growth in per pet spending. From a geographic perspective, U.S. and International markets will contribute balanced growth.","Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of revenue is expected to be in the range of 31% to 32%. The expected improvement over 2018 is driven by price increases and manufacturing cost reductions, partially offset by the impact of the Abaxis acquisition and currency movements.","We expect adjusted SG&A for the year to be between $1.47 billion and $1.52 billion. We anticipate foreign exchange to reduce growth by approximately 1% on a reported basis. Operational growth in SG&A reflects a full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition as well as investments in our diagnostics international field force and technical service teams. We'll also continue to fund strategic investments that has demonstrated a strong return including direct-to-consumer advertising for Apoquel and Simparica.","Moving on to R&D. We expect 2019 expenses to be between $445 million and $465 million. Consistent with 2018, we have committed to an increase over 2018 in R&D spending to ensure we're well positioned to capture future short, medium and long-term growth opportunities in critical spaces.","These spaces includes a new combination of parasiticides, monoclonal antibody therapies for pain in cats and dogs and new vaccines for poultry. We'll also continue to invest in the next wave of diagnostic innovations, building on our existing Zoetis and newly acquired diagnostic platforms to ensure we're delivering best-in-class point-of-care diagnostic solution.","The increase in adjusted net interest expense and other income deductions is related to our 2018 debt offering primarily used to fund the Abaxis acquisition. Our adjusted effective tax rate for 2019 is expected to be within the range of 20% to 21%. The increase over 2018 is related to the impact of favorable discrete non-recurring items in 2018 and the impact of the GILTI tax which is effective for us in 2019.","We project adjusted net income in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.7 billion representing 8% to 11% operational growth. While we do not provide specific guidance on cash flow, we anticipate that in 2019, operating cash flow will decline compared to 2018. As mentioned previously, we have significantly decreased our inventory months on hand to be in line with industry norms, which has provided a significant cash flow benefit in the last two years.","In 2019, we expect to continue in our current levels of months on hand, and as a result, we will not have the benefit of a working capital release in our cash flow. In 2019, we also expect an incremental increase of approximately $100 million in capital expenditures for information technology and manufacturing to support our recent acquisition, improved cost efficiencies and increased capacity.","In terms of our capital allocation priorities, we continue to focus first on internal, commercial, manufacturing and R&D investments, then business development opportunities, and finally returning excess capital to shareholders. We recently announced an increase to our dividend for Q1 2019 of 30% in line with our 2018 earnings growth and we also announced a new $2 billion multi-year share repurchase program resulting our consistent performance, financial discipline and the strength of our business model.","Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be in the range of $3.42 to $3.52. Our range for reported diluted EPS of $2.83 to $2.99 includes purchase accounting, Abaxis acquisition related costs and certain significant items. I'd also like to remind you that while we take a long-term view of our business and prefer to focus on annual rather quarterly results, there are some considerations, I want to point out for 2019 within the quarter.","The full-year impact of the Abaxis acquisition will have a disproportionate impact on growth across the P&L in the first half of 2019 and partially in Q3. In addition, foreign exchange will negatively impact growth in the first half of the year by approximately 400 basis points in Q1 and 300 basis points in Q2 in revenue.","Now to summarize, before we move to Q&A. 2018 was another strong year delivering topline operational growth of 10% and bottom line growth of 31%, demonstrating once again that Zoetis is committed to delivering on its value proposition. We also remain committed to creating shareholder value, returning more than $900 million to shareholders in 2018, through dividends and share repurchases.","We expect to continue delivering on our value proposition in 2019, driven by solid growth in our core business and increased contribution from the legacy Abaxis portfolio of diagnostics products. Finally in 2019, we will continue to invest internally and externally to grow profitably in the short, medium and long-term.","Now, I'll hand things over to the operator to open the line for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take today's first question from Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Ryskin","Thanks guys. Appreciate taking the call. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of quick questions. First one, you talked about 5% market growth for the overall industry in 2019. I just wanted to go into that a little bit deeper, because in the past, we've seen something more in the 5% to 6% range. So I'm wondering what you're seeing there, if you could give a little more color on the dairy markets, cattle markets in the U.S., some of the swine issues we're hearing about internationally?","And what I'm getting at with this is, what should be our expectation for the in-line portfolio in 2019? You know, if you exclude Abaxis, if you exclude the dermatology portfolio, Simparica, what's the base portfolio doing in terms of volume and price? And then I've got a quick follow-up questions on the margin expansion for 2019.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Okay. Thank you, Mike. I will try to cover some of the questions, and also, I will ask Glenn to provide some additional details on how we can see the growth, the in-line growth in 2019. So I agree that in previous communication, I mentioned that we expect in the market, a growth of 5% to 6%. Then we have seen that the cattle market, especially in the U.S., both beef and dairy has been showing some weakness and we expect that rather than 5% to 6%, now, we are projecting the total market growth of 5%.","We still expect that the cattle business worldwide will be showing growth, but definitely growth that will be below this 5%. The rest of the species, as I mentioned in my comments, companion animal, and also swine and poultry will be growing in line or slightly above the market and the only species that we see some market growth below the market will be cattle.","Then, moving into the details of the organic growth, as part of our guidance, it's 4.5 to 6.5. And then if Glenn can provide a little bit more details of how much will be price growth and also volume growth and new products?","Glenn David","Sure. So in terms of just the overall breakdown, it's really consistent with our long-term expectations. So price, we would to expect to generate around 2% price this year, we're particularly strong with price at 3% for 2018. Going into 2019, probably more in line with our long-term proposition of around 2%.","New products, again consistent, probably 1% to 2% and then the remainder comes from the in-line portfolio. We do consider derm part of the in-line portfolio as it has matured and has been on the market for a number of years at this point.","Also in terms of your question on margin expansion, when you look at where we closed 2018, cost of goods sold, as a percent of revenue, was a little over 32%. Our guidance for 2019 is 31% to 32%. And we made significant progress in cost of goods in 2018, improving our cost of goods, as a percent of revenue by over 100 basis points.","So that leaves about another 100 basis points to deliver our commitment of improving cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue by 200 basis points by 2020. You'll probably see that spread between 2019 and 2020 that attainment.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kevin Ellich with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.","Kevin Ellich","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just wanted to start off on the cost structure. I mean, it looks like some expenses this quarter came a little bit higher than we expected. And then Glenn you made comments about where you think things will line up in 2019 with increased investments in R&D. Can you just talk about some of the moving parts and given how good the year was for you in 2018? Did you pull-forward any expenses or how should we be thinking about that?","Glenn David","So Kevin, in terms of cost of goods, I'll start again. We had significant improvement this year of 100 basis points improvement in cost of goods. For Q4, we did see elevated cost of goods and that was really related to the impact of FX, also Abaxis and higher inventory write-offs in the quarter. Really the Q4 should not be viewed as a run rate for 2019. We have good visibility into our cost of goods, and we're confident in the guidance of 31% to 32% for 2019.","As we look into 2019, from an expense perspective, consistent with what we've said, we are making investments in R&D and R&D is growing more in line or closer to revenue. As we do have many projects that we're very excited about in our pipeline that we want to make sure that we fully fund. SG&A, when you look at the operational growth is growing below revenue even with the investments that we're making in Abaxis.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you. Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Erin Wright","Great, thanks. Can you speak to the underlying performance at Abaxis and how the integration is progressing in the longer term cross-selling opportunity with diagnostic portfolio? And then my second question is on Simparica Trio. Do you think there is a possibility that you're first to market there in that category? And how should we think about your competitive positioning there? And do you still feel confident in the 2020 timeline and do you anticipate one or two review cycles from FDA. Thanks.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you very much, Erin. I will probably start with the comments on the Abaxis integration. Glenn, will also provide some details of Abaxis performance, and then I will also talk about the Simparica Trio. In terms of Abaxis integration, things are progressing in line or even in some cases faster than initially planned. In the U.S., both teams, Abaxis legacy team in the field force and also our teams are already working together.","And as we communicated initially, the Zoetis team is already identifying the opportunities and also helping the other team also to identify customers to complete the sales. They will be also engaging, ensuring that we increase the use of consumables and this will be an opportunity for future growth.","We are working definitely that in the future we will be, not only the teams that are working together, but also the portfolio will be fully integrated, and this also, it's depending in some of the work that we are doing in terms of the SAP implementation for Abaxis operations that we plan to do it in 2019.","In international markets, we're also progressing pretty well. We have almost completed the hiring process of field force and also technical support, but still some positions that will be completed in the next coming months. But this team is already working together with the field force team of Zoetis, generating the demand. In most of the markets, the supply to customers will be still done through third-party distributors.","And in 2020, we'll be deciding if we keep distribution or we go direct in some of the markets. But definitely, all the integration opportunities or integration plans are progressing pretty well. We are also working on continue identifying opportunities in terms of R&D and the scenario that also we are integrating the teams of \u2013 sitting in Kalamazoo, also in Denmark and Union City. Altogether are defining the future portfolio of Zoetis in both companion animal and livestock. Glenn, do you want to give details of Abaxis performance?","Glenn David","In terms of performance for the quarter for Abaxis, as we mentioned, we had $65 million in sales for the quarter. I want to remind you that Abaxis was on a different accounting calendar. But however, if you do normalize the accounting calendar, that would translate to approximately 8% growth.","Again, within the quarter, we did have some destocking to bring Abaxis more in line with our overall levels of inventory with wholesalers. If you adjust for that destocking, the growth for the quarter is double-digit. Also for the year, again if you try to look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, the growth is double-digits for the year with and without the destocking.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Glenn. And then moving to triple combo. So let me maybe provide a little bit of a context. So when we launched Simparica as a single agent, we were two or three years behind competitors, Nexgard and Bravecto. Now with the triple combo, it will be first \u2013 second to market. But what we did is significantly reduced this gap of two or three years and then we expect that if FDA approval is coming in line with our filings and expectation is to introduce this product in 2020.","So given we are second to market, we will be only second with few more different with competitor. We see a significant improvement compared to the situation that we had with Simparica. And with Simparica, we have been able to continue growing that patient share. In 2018, we increased patient share from 13.1 at the beginning of the year to 15.6 at the end of the year. So we are confident that with the efficacy and also the safety profile of Simparica and the future efficacy and safety profile of triple combo, we'll have the opportunity to have significant market share.","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll go next to Louise Chen with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Louise Chen","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So my question here is, can you talk more about your pipeline as it pertains to the mAbs, livestock diagnostic and aquaculture? When will some of these new products hit the market? Do they have the potential to be blockbusters or an aggregate to be blockbusters? And then just a quick follow-up on the triple combo, is that expected to be a blockbuster product for you as well? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","I'll start with the easiest question. Thank you, Louise. It's definitely, triple combo is expected to be a blockbuster. Definitely Simparica is already a blockbuster, but we expect also that the triple combo will reach this status. In terms of the rest of the pipeline, definitely there are products for livestock. These products \u2013 there are a lot of product that maybe in aggregate basis will represent a significant growth opportunity. But I will not describe these products as probably in livestock as a blockbuster potential. But definitely, it will help us, first to protect the current portfolio, and second, to bring innovation in livestock into the market.","In terms of monoclonal antibodies for chronic pain, we expect that this will have the opportunity of being a blockbuster and we are convinced that the monoclonal antibodies for dogs and cats will represent significant opportunity for treating dogs and cats in a different way that is today with NSAID, especially for cats, that there is nothing especially developed for these animals in terms of pain.","But we also are excited about the opportunity of developing monoclonal antibody for dermatology in cats. Again, it's an opportunity that we expect that will be coming in the next year and this will strengthen our derm portfolio, also moving another species with monoclonal antibody.","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to John Kreger with William Blair. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Kaufman","Hi, good morning. This is Jon Kaufman on for John Kreger. So a couple of questions on cattle here, you mentioned premium product sales in the U.S. Is that a trend that you foresee continuing in spite of market weakness? And then internationally, where are we in the cycle and some of the key markets? Looking out beyond 2019, can international growth more than offset U.S. weakness? And what are your expectations for long-term growth in this market? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Definitely, the U.S. market for cattle has been driven by our premium products. But some of our products, they face competition during the year, especially when the situation of the animal was of lower risk profile. But we also have seen that in risk situation, our premium products are the best products that we need to protect or to treat animals. So we are confident that our premium products also will remain generating growth in the future.","In the U.S., definitely we see the cattle business growing below market and maybe also growing below what we expected some months ago. Because we also projected dairy recovery in the second half of 2018, then we think that it will take even longer to see a recovery on the dairy business.","In the case of beef, I think, it will be always cycles, animals moving into the big lot sooner or later, but we don't see a significant change on beef. We're still projecting that beef will be slightly increased in the number of animals only by 1%. But we think that beef will be probably in line with what we expected some months ago. We expect that the overall cattle business of Zoetis will be growing in 2019 and maybe growing faster in international markets than in the U.S.","And as we said many times, the diversity of our portfolio in species and geographies is helping us to manage these cycles. These are cycles that we have been facing forever. And one of the things that, not only our industry, but also Zoetis has been very consistent even in the phase of change cycles, regulatory situations, very consistently delivering growth inline with the market or even higher in the last six years of Zoetis as a public independent company.","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Block","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe a couple of questions and I'll try to rope into one long one. So Glenn, 150 FX basis point headwind, I thought you messaged maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points recently at JPMorgan. So I just want to see if I'm correct, and what if anything has changed there? And then on that same question, does the midpoint of the 2019 EPS of $3.47 imply any sort of a share repo? I think just trying to flow through your numbers. I get towards the lower end of the EPS, if I use the 4Q share count.","And then just to pivot over to Abaxis, when you guys bought Abaxis, Juan Ram\u00f3n, they had a bunch of new products in their pipeline and your own sentiment, blood gas, rapid assay, so just any more color you can give us, in your control now for four or five months, how is the uptake been on some of these new products within that portfolio? Thanks for your time guys.","Glenn David","So Jon, so I'll address the FX question. So you're correct, when we're at JPMorgan, we did see a bigger impact of foreign exchange based on the rates that were applicable at that time. In terms of the guidance that we have today, we based the guidance based on FX rates as of the end of January. And as I mentioned based on that, there is 150 basis point impact to revenue.","However, if you look the last few weeks, the dollar has continued to strengthen and based on the rates that we see actually as of yesterday, our revenues would be negatively impacted by about another $50 million and EPS by a few pennies. So this is currently not reflected in our guidance and something that we'll continue to monitor.","The other question you had was, in terms of the midpoint and share repo, when we set our guidance range, we really only assume that will offset dilution from compensation in terms of setting our guidance, but nothing additional.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Jon, then on the Abaxis question, so the focus that we have been there in the last [indiscernible] has been to ensure that all the portfolio, existing portfolio were really meeting the needs and the quality that is expected from our customers. And one of the efforts that we have been doing significantly is to make sure that our equipments are connected to the practice management system and that's really helping veterinarians to have a full integration of information from different equipments in the clinic.","We have also been working on defining the priorities in terms of R&D focus and we are progressing well. In terms of, you were asking also about new products, well, definitely FLEX4 is working very well. We also are planning to introduce FLEX4 in the international market within Canada and some other markets. And we will provide a little bit more details on the future launches as we are making progress in terms of defining all the priorities and all the products that will be coming in the next coming year.","So next question.","Operator","We'll go next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David Risinger","Thanks very much. Well, first of all, congrats on the performance. I have two high level questions. The first is with respect to Abaxis, we spoke with a consultant who suggested that it will be difficult for Abaxis to displace IDEXX at many U.S. customers. Could you speak to that, your ability to knock IDEXX out of U.S. customers and drive placements of Abaxis going forward?","And then with respect to the FDA's assessment of heartworm drug efficacy and potential resistance concerns, could you just speak to where the FDA is in that process and whether the heartworm coverage that you're able to demonstrate to the FDA for TRIO will be at the 100% level or whatever level the FDA will require? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Dave. Well, starting with the question on heartworm, definitely we have presented to the FDA all the support of 100% efficacy in terms of protection against heartworm. So what is the process of the FDA is something that probably we cannot comment. But we are confident that we have submitted all the data to support our efficacy and safety profile. We will continue working with the FDA. It's a process. It's the process of submitting the different dossiers information and also responding to questions. We are confident that the process will be able to introduce the product in 2020.","About the question on, can we gain share in the U.S.? Well, the answer is, yes. And we are convinced now that Zoetis is competing with any competitor in the market on equal or even stronger conditions. In the past, Abaxis was limited in terms of access to customers and I mentioned that maybe they were meeting or visiting customers once per quarter compared to the other competitors having even more frequency than once a month.","Now we have the opportunity to really be in front of our customers even more than once a month for few customers. And also very important, we have the opportunity also to combine all the diagnostics portfolio with our strong portfolio of vaccines, parasiticides, derm and so on and so forth.","And also create a value proposition to the customers that it was not available at the time of Abaxis. So I understand that it maybe people that need to be convinced, but I hope and we are working hard to make them wrong in terms of the assessment that we cannot compete against IDEXX.","Next question please.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Schott with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Schott","Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I guess, first one was on Apoquel. I'm just trying to get a sense of where we are in the growth cycle here. So specifically how much more growth potential do you see for the product in the U.S. market? And when we think about the ex-U.S. opportunity, can you just give us little bit more color about how uptick has trended relative to the U.S. in the markets you've launched and what are the biggest ex-U.S. opportunities that you're watching?","My second question was on margin expansion over time. So beyond 2019, I know you've highlighted 2019 to be of an investment year with Abaxis coming on Board and the R&D investments. But when we look beyond 2019, can we think about OpEx growth returning back down to low single-digit levels or should we think about Zoetis in a period of kind of multi-year period of OpEx investment as you have become as growth drivers [indiscernible] just beyond 2019 as we think about the longer-term model? Thanks very much.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Chris. Well, on Apoquel, I'm going to comment for the U.S. and also comment for international. In the U.S., we started the year with a patient share of 59% and we ended 63%. We still think that there are opportunities for growing patient share.","Second, we still see opportunities for expanding the market. I will continue expanding the market or hoping to expand the market with DTC campaigns, that will be the third year that we are investing to create this market demand.","And third, we still see opportunities for pricing. So these three elements are probably supporting the growth in the U.S. for Apoquel. Definitely, lower growth than what we have seen in previous year. So the growth has been in the market now for four years, it would be five years in 2019. So we should expect that there will be some reduction on the growth in the U.S.","In international market, well, the situation is slightly different, and I'm not talking about only Apoquel, I'm talking the full derm portfolio, including Cytopoint. Cytopoint has been introduced in the market recently in some of the international markets. We expect growth in the introduction of Cytopoint.","We still expect growth for Apoquel definitely in terms of patient share, it's below the patient share that we have achieved in the U.S. and we expect that over time reaching similar level of patient share. Although the number of medicalized drugs outside of the U.S. is lower than in the U.S.","And finally, we expect in 2019, to introduce the product in China. And again, China has been a market that has been surprisingly positive in terms of growth in companion animal. Now, if I remember well and Glenn you can correct me if I'm not, now China in terms of companion animal is the second largest after the U.S. and maybe some other market, but second or third. It's in companion animal growing very fast and we expect also that Apoquel will be successfully introduced in this market.","Talking about margin expansion, you wanted to cover this question.","Glenn David","Of course, Chris, there are number of opportunities for us in terms of margin expansion beyond 2019, just starting with cost of goods and beyond 2020 and delivering on the proposition of delivering a 200 basis point improvement in 2017.","As we look past that, we should be able to continue to get improvements in our cost of goods as a percent of revenue. Really, the cost of goods efficiency coming from a lot of the capital investments that we're making today, which we expect to payoff in longer-term in terms of improved cost of goods and we'll continue to also get margin expansion from price.","Looking at the OpEx line, from a G&A perspective, we do expect general administrative expenses to grow more in line with inflation as we already have the infrastructure established in most of our markets.","Selling will probably be more between the overall inflation rate and the growth in revenue, and depending on the level of revenue growth that we have and new product introductions that we'll need to support. And then from an R&D perspective that will really depend on the opportunities that we have, but that will probably grow more in line with revenue than others.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Glenn. And then maybe adding that to the question on Apoquel or derm, I did mention that one-day we should be also facing competition. It's an area that Zoetis has created. It's not the first time that we are creating the market. We did it for pain and now with derm.","But we are convinced that we have developed a significant portfolio in derm, portfolio, which is showing high level of efficacy, excellent safety profile and we'll be also adding in the future monoclonal antibodies for dermatology issues for cat. So we are confident that we have the opportunity of continue growing. Always we need to consider future competition in this respect.","Next question please.","Operator","And we'll take today's final question from Kathy Miner with Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kathleen Miner","Great, thank you for taking the question. One, just a brief follow-up on the dermatology area, and I apologize if I missed it, but did you give an update for your expectations for 2019 for dermatology, particularly as you've met or exceeded the $500 million-plus for 2018?","And the second question just on M&A, does your 2019 guidance assume any small bolt-on acquisitions? And given that Abaxis is now on board, what would be the key areas we should watch for that? There might be some interest in adding? Thank you.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","Thank you, Kathy. And well, in terms of the sales, big sales for our derm portfolio, so in 2018, we almost reached $600 million, it was $593 million. We are projecting growth in 2019, but definitely we are not now updating in terms of big sales. We know that in the future, we'll have competition in this space, so it's a little bit complicated now, what is the full potential. We are convinced that we still have opportunities to continue growing.","And as I mentioned before, we also expect to add new products to our portfolio, monoclonal antibodies for cats and maybe also working to ensure that we also apply lifecycle innovation to Apoquel to protect this franchise. And this can be in terms of formulations, in terms of expansion to other species, so it's something that will continue working on lifecycle innovation.","And then you also ask if we are including any acquisitions for in 2019 guidance and the answer is no, so it's just our current portfolio including Abaxis portfolio and what we described now as organic growth including Abaxis, and that we will continue assessing opportunities in the market.","We are convinced that we have the infrastructure, we have the expertise to integrate and also we have the reach to the customers and we will continue assessing opportunities available in the market and if these opportunities are meeting the criteria of strategic value creation and supported by financials. We think that we have the cash flexibility to go and acquire other companies.","Juan Ram\u00f3n Alaix","And I think with that, we conclude this session. So thank you very much for attending the earnings call. Thank you for your questions. And with that, we close this call. Thank you.","Operator","And this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."]}}
