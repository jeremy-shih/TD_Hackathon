My name is Jessica Morgan and I will be your conference facilitator. (Operator Instructions). At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary Rodkin","","Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I am Gary Rodkin and as usual I am here with John Gehring, our CFO and Chris Klinefelter, our VP of Investor Relations. Before we get started, Chris has a few words.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that can influence and impact our expected results perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks Chris. First quarter diluted EPS on a comparable basis was $0.39 versus $0.37 a year ago which is ahead of where we expect it to be. During our first quarter of fiscal \u201915 we drove progress in a number of areas. First, Consumer Foods volumes strengthened, we improved share, made sales gains in alternative channels and posted good productivity savings.","Also we continue to improve the underlying health of our Private Brands operations positioning us for margin expansion and new business as the year progresses and within commercial foods we continue to pick up new business through Lamb Weston.","We\u2019re pleased with our start to the fiscal year and we see the hard work from last year beginning to show returns. We know that one quarter does not make a year and that there is a lot of time left in fiscal \u201915. I feel good about the underlying progress. We continue to have a very high sense of focus and urgency against our objectives and we look forward to delivering the full potential of ConAgra Foods. With this good start to the year we are very confident in our full year EPS projections.","I want to acknowledge the news I shared last month about my intent to retire at the end of this fiscal year. The reason I'm retiring is simply that I want to spend more time on the personal side. At this point I have had an all-encompassing corporate job for a very long time and I'm ready to devote more time to family, friends and outside interest.","I feel honored to have led ConAgra Foods for the past nine years. It's been a meaningful journey personally and professionally and I believe the dramatic changes we have made at ConAgra Foods in terms of the operations, the culture and the strategies will serve shareholders well over the long term. I'm fully engaged in achieving our near term objectives as well and I'm confident that we will meet expectations. It's very hard for me to leave this role and company that I care so deeply about but I believe we will be on a very solid footing as we finish fiscal \u201915.","Now on to segment specific news. Within Consumer Foods, we had a 1% decline in sales which includes flat organic volume, and flat price mix. Clearly the volume performance was a big sequential improvement over Q4 and came in a bit ahead of what we expected. Comparable profit increased 19%.","The work to get to that volume performance in Q1 was important in foundation building. In fact there is a lot of work going on now to grow volume, increase share and improve margins all across the segment and particularly in our fixed and grow brands.","I will touch on each of those in a minute. But first I want to tell you about a significant milestone. We achieved the number one dollar share position in frozen single serve meals during the quarter. As you know that\u2019s been a challenging category for retailers but it's still very large, important and profitable for customers and food manufacturers alike and we believe this is still a good business. We think the combination of deep insights, a focus on core users and leveraging differentiating innovation can help us continue to grow.","As you know one of our major frozen brands Healthy Choice has struggled in single serve frozen meals. It's one of our fixed and grow brands but we\u2019re confident of our direction focused with that brand. As you may recall we are moving out of slow selling SKUs and into more of our proprietary Healthy Choice Caf\u00e9 Steamers line which has been consistently strong since it's introduction in 2008.","The Caf\u00e9 Steamers we have market are showing strong growth and we\u2019re confident of bigger second half progress in Healthy Choice as we begin to lap some of the assortment pruning we did last year on slower selling sublines.","Meanwhile Q1 for Marie Callender's was particularly strong with the single serve dinner business up double-digits in dollar and volume sales. Marie Callender's has a long winning streak and increasing household penetration, a good testament to the quality of the food, advertising that resonates and the focus on the core user.","Overall in Frozen we\u2019re confident of our portfolio and it's strength and are looking forward to better numbers on Healthy Choice later in the year.","Chef Boyardee our second challenged brand is beginning to perform better and return to the easy open can that consumers prefer and our new merchandising strategy has begun to pay dividends at some of our key customers already. Performance on Chef Boyardee is improving as we speak.","On Orville Redenbacher's we\u2019re working through some packaging, assortment and merchandising changes that will all go into the market late this calendar year. We expect these changes to be meaningful and positive as we look forward.","Within popcorn we have seen a strong quarterly performance from Act II which benefited significantly from some simple graphic changes in the packaging. We know this category has room for growth and we know the Orville Redenbacher's brand equity is strong.","Snacking is clearly a growth area and Slim Jim was a great performer in the quarter growing double-digits and volume in net sales and taking share. This is another example of a strong brand that knows it's core consumer and communicates them with them in a way that really resonates.","Reddi-wip is another brand that had an outstanding quarter and the key here is expanding usage occasions. Reddi-wip\u2019s success is an example of being persistent and tenacious with a good idea specifically getting displays of Reddi-wip next to fruit."," ","We had a terrific summer season with the brand with double digit growth and volume of sales and great share pickup as well. Our intensified focus on club, dollar and convenient stores is beginning to drive impact. As you know these retail outlets are growing faster than traditional grocers and we\u2019re beginning to seize our share of this growth.","We\u2019re gaining sizeable distribution in club stores with brands like Reddi-wip, Hunt\u2019s, Bertolli, Swiss Miss and Marie Callender\u2019s. And we\u2019re securing new distribution for some of our brands as well in the dollar store format. All-in-all we\u2019re making some big strides in channels and have more room to grow.","In terms of the bottom-line Consumer Foods comparable profits increased 19%, productivity and other efficiency initiatives offset inflation and we continue to find ways to work much more effectively freeing up resources to focus on growth.","Within our Private Brands segment sales were down 2% versus last year\u2019s first quarter and comparable operating profit declined 28% reflecting the fact that we made pricing concessions in the second half of our last fiscal year because of our customer service and quality execution issues.","While a meaningful decline is sequentially better than last quarter, the good news is that we have resolved these issues and we will start lapping those pricing concessions that we had to make last fiscal year as we get into the second half of this fiscal year. I also want to point out that while we have to do some firefighting last year the fixes we put in place are sustainable and provide us with a much better operating model and foundation.","We\u2019re gaining deeper, faster and more granular visibility into our private brand operations now and because of that we\u2019re being much more proactive on both the challenges and on the opportunities and having stable operations lets us begin to leverage our scale and use some important tools like SAP which are just starting to be implemented in certain parts of the segments operations.","And most importantly stabilizing our operations and delivering our customers what they expect, when they expect it, allows us now to compete for business proactively not reactively which means we have the opportunity to return to more normalized pricing in overall improved customer relationships and by that I mean partnerships where we\u2019re squarely focused on growth.","Let me share a bit of color now in some of our larger product lines and Private Brands specifically snacks, bars, cereal, in-store bakery and pasta. We\u2019re taking advantage of snacking demand through new emulations in some of the fastest growing snacking areas like pretzel flats and pieces, a new bolder flavors of crackers and we\u2019re also doing some of our own unique innovations for several retailers.","We\u2019re also a major player in the large and growing snack nuts category. In bars the focus in growth off-late is really on the protein and fiber bars where we have strong emulations sold under the retail labels. While some parts of the overall bars category growth slowed we have a broad set of emulation and manufacturing capabilities across many different bar types and we\u2019re adjusting those resources to the areas of the category that are in the highest demand.","As you all know the cereal category has been very soft so this will become we believe more of a share proposition for us. What we have to do is better leverage our very strong emulation capabilities and a margin structure that\u2019s attractive to retailers. Our fourth product line I want to mention is our in-store bakery business where we make everything from bagels to artisan bread to cookies sold in the parameter of the store. We have tremendous capabilities here and the growth prospects are very solid as sales in this part of the store grow.","For example we just launched a new flavor platform for our Lofthouse Cookies that allows us to leverage our strength during holidays and expand on it year around and finally a word on pasta, a category that has experienced significant pricing competition in the past several years. This is a sizeable business for us and one where we will use our state of the art capabilities particularly in operations to rebuild our margins overtime.","So you can see our breadth across the store, and with our arms around the operational issues we can work with retailers to design solutions to meet the shopper needs. In fact we have picked up a good bit of new business over the past six months that we\u2019re working to bring to market in the second half of fiscal \u201915.","Our current projections are for modest sales and profit growth in this segment in fiscal \u201915 and for growth to accelerate in fiscal \u201916 and \u201917 on both the top and bottom-line as we continue to get good synergies, operations continue to become more efficient and we gain new business and distribution. The fundamental appeal to consumers, the strategic importance and profitability of Private Brands to trade customers and value added capabilities of the ConAgra Foods Private Brands operations make this a long term growth factor for us.","Moving on to commercial foods, sales were $1.1 billion up 2% over a year ago. The volume increased 3% while a comparable operating profit as expected decreased 9% versus a year ago.","In our biggest business in this segment, Lamb Weston potato product sales were up primarily due to more growth in the food service channel. Profits were below year-ago amounts, the year-over-year profit decline reflects less profitable mix given the loss of a large food service customer last year which we have not yet lapped and the last quarter of last year\u2019s poor potato quality both of which we have talked about before. We will get both of those issues behind us in the fiscal second quarter as we lap the customer loss and our into the new crop.","We have diversified and strengthened our customer base since last year so we feel good about the sales potential and our prospects going forward. On the international front for Lamb Weston some of our customers are facing the impact of adverse food quality news in China. This will give us some short term headwinds but the long term growth potential in developing markets will continue to be robust. Importantly we completed our acquisition of a Chinese potato processor during Q1 giving us the ability to process potatoes close to our fast growing QSR customer base.","Also Lamb Weston\u2019s newly expanded board Portland, Oregon plant had a very successful startup recently and is running smoothly and this plant will help us better serve the growing demand from our global customers. Within the rest of the commercial food segment, sales and profits were in-line with a year ago.","And just as a reminder, we completed the Ardent Mills transaction, so we no longer have any flour milling operations in our results for continuing operations. We will recognize our share of Ardent earnings through equity method, investment earnings. Ardent Mills is off to a very strong start, we\u2019re excited that the startup of that operation has gone so smoothly. This deal will be accretive to comparable EPS in a few short years and clearly as a long term strategic and financial win for us.","To wrap things up before I turn it over to John, Q1 was a quarter of important progress. We said fiscal \u201915 would be a year of stabilization and recovery and we got off to a very good start on that in Q1. We are continuing to drive great urgency in getting more effective and efficient throughout ConAgra Foods and we\u2019re on track for the resulting SG&A savings. This favorably impacts the performance for all of our segments.","Consumer Foods is making good progress overall in the tough environment. There are many bright spots with our brands and the brands that have weighted on results are beginning to respond to our efforts to improve. Private Brands is starting to stabilize although a still good bit below our long term expected profitability and we\u2019re operating with more confidence. We\u2019re picking up new business, have clear line of sight to better margins and we\u2019re moving toward our strategy vision that will capitalize on the strength of our unique portfolio. And commercial foods continues to be a very strategic and profitable scale business for us. The recent short term challenges will soon be in the past. The more diverse base of customers we have built over the last year will help us over the long run. We see fiscal \u201915 as a more normal year in regard to the potato crop and the international growth prospects are real and sustainable.","We\u2019re pleased with our results for Q1 and we look forward with conviction to delivering the rest of the year. We\u2019re also confident the work we have done will drive strong performance in fiscal \u201916 and \u201917 where we plan for EPS growth acceleration. John will share additional details now.","John Gehring","Thank you Gary. Good morning everyone. I'm going to touch on four points this morning, I will start with some comments on our fiscal first quarter performance. Next I will cover comparability matters and then on the cash flow capital on balance sheet items and finally I will provide some comments on our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.","Let\u2019s start with our performance, overall for the fiscal first quarter the results were a bit better than our expectations and reflect progress against several key focus areas for fiscal 2015.","We have reaffirmed our full year goals and continue to expect fiscal 2015 results to reflect stabilization and recovery. Before I cover some of the details I would remind everyone that with the formation of Ardent Mills early in the fiscal quarter flouring milling results prior to the formation of the JV are reflected as discontinued operations. Historical results from continuing operations reflect this change most notably within EPS and the results of the commercial food segment. We have provided revised numbers in the written Q&A document associated with this release. Also our share of earnings from our 44% interest in Ardent Mills is included in equity method investment earnings. Importantly we continue to use $2.17 of a share as are comparable 2014 earnings base.","For the fiscal first quarter we reported net sales of $3.7 billion in-line with the year-ago quarter. For the quarter we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.25 versus $0.30 in the year ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability fully diluted earnings per share were $0.39 up $0.02 over comparable year-ago amounts reflecting strong performance in our consumer food segment, increased equity method investment earnings and lower interest and corporate expenses offset by lower earnings in our commercial foods and private brand segments.","Now I will share few comments on our segment performance starting with our consumer food segment where net sales were approximately $1.6 billion down about 1% from the year ago period reflecting flat volume flat price mix and some rounding. While we have more work to do to drive consistent top line growth we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making and the improvement in trends.","Our Consumer Food segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $199 million or up about 19% from the year-ago period. The operating profit reflects improving volume trends and lower marking and SG&A cost. The impact from foreign exchange on net sales and operating profit for the segment this fiscal quarter was immaterial.","Our consumer food supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results. This quarter cost savings approximately offset inflation of about 3% which was in-line with our expectations and was driven by cost increases on certain inputs particularly proteins. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was 72 million down 30% from the prior year quarter which included significant cost associated with several large new product launches.","Our private brand segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $980 million down about 2% from the prior year quarter. The net sales decrease reflects modest volume declines a portion of which relates to the elimination of certain low margin business.","Operating profit excluding items impacting comparability was approximately $48 million or down about 28% from the prior year, this decline reflects the continuing but moderating margin compression driven by the pricing consensus in the prior fiscal year. As well as temporarily higher operating cost associated with supply chain initiatives.","While we still have significant margin recovery ahead of us we\u2019re pleased with a continued progress and improved operating stability of this segment. In our commercial food segment net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or up about 2% from the prior year quarter. The net sales increase reflects about 3 points of volume improvement partially offset by about 1 point of negative price mix. The commercial food segment\u2019s operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $125 million or 9% below the year ago period.","The operating profit decline reflects the impacts on gross margins from a less profitable sales mix and from the poor quality crop. As Gary noted the transition to the new crop will be completed in the second quarter. The gross margin decrease was partially offset by lower SG&A costs across the segment. Equity method investment earnings were higher this quarter reflecting approximately two months of earnings from the Ardent Mills joint venture as well as improved profits from our international potato joint venture.","Moving on to corporate expenses, for the quarter corporate expenses were approximately $141 million adjusting for items impacting comparability corporate expenses were $64 million versus $66 million in the year ago quarter.","And briefly on discontinued operations as I noted earlier subsequent to fiscal year the fiscal 2014 yearend we completed the formation of Ardent Mills. As part of the process we divested three of our flour mills and recognized the gain of $91 million in the fourth quarter of last year. The company also recorded a gain of $625 million in connection with the formation of Ardent Mills in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. These gains are now reflected in discontinued operations.","Now I will move on to my next topic items impacting comparability. Overall we have approximately $96 million or $0.14 per diluted share of net expense in the quarter\u2019s reported EPS related to several items. On hedging for the fiscal first quarter the net hedging loss included in corporate expense was $50 million or $0.07 per share.","We recorded a loss of approximately $25 million or $0.04 per share related to extinguishment of debt. Next we recorded approximately $23 million or $0.03 per share of net expense related to integration and restructuring cost. And finally in the fiscal first quarter we recognized a net after-tax benefit related to historical legal matters of $3 million or approximately $0.01 per share.","Next I will cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First we ended the quarter with $134 million of cash on-hand and $545 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowing. We continue to target operating cash flows of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015 and we expect this will provide us ample cash to achieve our fiscal 2015 debt repayment target.","On working capital for fiscal 2015 we expect working capital changes to contribute modestly to operating cash flow. On capital expenditures for the quarter we had capital expenditures of $112 million versus $174 million in the prior year and for the full fiscal year we continue to expect CapEx to be approximately $600 million. Net interest expense was $84 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $96 million in the year ago quarter. Dividends for this fiscal quarter and the year-ago quarter for $105 million.","On capital allocation as we have previously noted our capital allocation priority through fiscal year 2015 will be the repayment of debt. In connection with the formation of Ardent Mills in the first quarter of 2015 we received proceeds from the sales of three mills and distributions from Ardent Mills which totaled approximately $569 million or about $530 million after estimated tax liabilities.","During the first quarter we completed two transactions related to our debt repayment plans. First we essentially refinanced approximately $550 million outstanding under our term loan through the issuance of two year floating rate notes and terminated the term loan.","In addition we utilized proceeds from the Ardent Mills transaction to repurchase about $500 million of our outstanding long term debt across various maturities. By the end of fiscal 2015 we expect to have repay about $2 billion of debt since the Ralcorp acquisition, including $1 billion this fiscal year was about 500 million of that coming from the Ardent Mills proceeds.","As we enter fiscal 2016 with a stronger balance sheet we expect to have more flexibility in our capital allocation to consider dividend increases, share repurchases and additional growth investments. We remain committed to a strong dividend and intend to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we delever. However during this period we expect to limit our share repurchases and this quarter we did not repurchase any shares.","And while we expect limited acquisition activity in the near term as we repay debt we will continue to prudently support the right investments for our business. For instance during the fiscal first quarter consistent with our global growth strategies we acquired a potato processing facility in Shangdu, China for $93 million. This investment accelerates our strategic plans in this important market but it does not interfere with our other capital allocation goals.","Now I would like to provide a brief update on our fiscal 2015 outlook. For fiscal 2015 we continue to expect diluted earnings per share adjusted for items impacting comparability to grow at a rate in the mid-single digits from our fiscal 2014 comparable base of $2.17.","Our current full year guidance reflects our view of several key performance factors including the following. First, in our consumer food segment we continue to focus on stabilizing volume performance and expect a stronger year-over-year operating profit performance.","In our Private Brand segment we expect volumes to improve over the course of the fiscal year and we\u2019re very focused on margin recovery in this segment. While we\u2019re incurring some temporarily higher operating costs related to supply chain initiatives which will benefit future years we do expect to see gradual margin improvement as we move through fiscal 2015. And overall we currently expect profits for this segment to be up modestly for the fiscal year.","In our Commercial Food segment we expect good sales and profit growth led by strong performance in our Lamb Weston business driven by international growth and improved margins from a better potato crop beginning in the second quarter.","We expect that our other food service and commercial businesses in this segment will post moderate profit growth in fiscal 2015. We also expect higher equity method investment earnings due to the contribution from Ardent Mills. As a remainder while we\u2019re confident that overtime Ardent Mills will be accretive to our earnings there is about $0.08 of EPS dilution included in our fiscal 2015 outlook. Overall equity method investment earnings in total are expected to be in excess of $100 million for full fiscal year.","In addition we continue to expect our supply chain productivity benefits including Ralcorp synergies, to exceed $350 million in the aggregate for all three operating segments in fiscal 2015.","Further our SG&A effectiveness and efficiency initiatives will drive at least $50 million of savings for the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2015 we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% although this rate may fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter. Also as a reminder the income tax expense line includes tax on a portion of our equity method investment earnings which are shown pretax.","We\u2019re off to a good start but at the same time we recognized there is a lot of the year left so we\u2019re maintaining our current full year guidance.","As we indicated in the release we expect the remainder of this year\u2019s EPS growth to be in the back half of the fiscal year for all of the reasons you\u2019ve heard us talk about before. As such we expect our second quarter comparable earnings per share to be in-line with the year ago amount. It was our strongest quarter last year so we have our toughest lap at that point. In summary, we are pleased with the start of the fiscal 2015 and while we have a lot more work to do we are encouraged by the progress we\u2019re seeing against the objectives we have set forth for the year.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass we\u2019re happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And it looks like our first question will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Gary on your last call I think you guys mentioned that you expected consumer volume for the year to be flat maybe just slightly down I guess for the full year and then with sequential improvement throughout the year. I'm trying to get a sense if that\u2019s still your thinking because obviously you started out the year with flat volume there and if it is still the case is it possible we will see a step back in volume maybe over the next quarter or two just because of the way either comps flow or what you\u2019re doing on the merchandising plan. Trying to get a sense how we should view that?","Gary Rodkin","Yes Andrew, I would tell you that we feel really good about the start on consumer volume. A really intense focus on the fundamentals, we call it perfect at retail, is gaining traction and it's demonstrating it's power in Consumer Foods. So I think that the traction is real. Let me turn it to Tom for some more color.","Tom McGough","Sure Andrew. You know what we expect is the foundational progress that we made in Q1 we should sustain throughout the year. What we will be facing going in the Q2 is we\u2019re going to be executing pricing based on the commodity increases that we have seen in several of our businesses that will create a headwind but overall we expect the volume to be fairly flat for the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","We have heard here and there of some let\u2019s call it smaller frozen entree players that are really more in the health and wellness arena that are trying to be pretty aggressive about or expecting to get one or two full doors of placement in the freezer case that some retailers going forward. Obviously that would add significant pressure to the incumbent brand that are currently there and we will see how successful these companies ultimately are but I'm trying to get a sense of whether that\u2019s something you see in your conversations with retailers or is that a risk that perhaps is something that we should worry a bit less about given what you\u2019re doing around SKU reduction at Healthy Choice and focusing on the steamer line?","Gary Rodkin","Yes Andrew, I would tell you we certainly do see some of that. There is always smaller players looking to get in and that is the case in the freezer case. But I can tell you we have got really good feedback from our customers that given our performance in frozen and what we have been doing to try and grow the business and obviously gain share that it will impact us in a very immaterial way. Our competitors will potentially feel more of that but that really shouldn\u2019t disrupt us at all.","Operator","We will move now to Citi\u2019s, David Driscoll.","David Driscoll - Citi","Gary, can you describe the current service levels to your private label customers and kind of how things have changed over the last maybe two quarters and can you discuss related to this the process of private label contract rebidding, how long did these contracts typically go? Is it a six months? Is it a year? And just trying to get a sense for what we should expect going forward on the progression and recovery of this operation?","Gary Rodkin","Yes David, I could tell you that we feel really good about the service levels in Private Brands, it's night and day difference from a year ago, Paul, maybe a little more.","Paul Maass","Yes, especially a year ago and seasonality, the second quarter is a really important quarter and we are working through just very significant issues. Our service levels are where they need to be in the 98% range, we measure them consistently. Big focus area for us and the good news is that our sales team is on their heels reacted to a bunch of issues, we\u2019re really managing the business the way it needs to be managed. On the color on the rebidding, I would say on Private Brands it's part of the business so it's ongoing element that we manage through. There is different things that will trigger a rebid by category, by customer, our focus is on the fundamentals, we\u2019re building the business out the right way, developing stronger customer partnerships making a ton of progress and have confidence in how things will evolve as we go through the year.","David Driscoll - Citi","A separate question, I think you guys said that the Ralcorp-ConAgra savings are now expected at 350 million. Do I remember correctly that the original forecast was 300, is this a $50 million step-up and can you give us any color as to the specific savings expected this year fiscal \u201815?","John Gehring","Yes David let me clarify that for you. I think the two numbers are a little mixed up there. We continue to see that the synergies from the Ralcorp deal by fiscal 2017 to be a run-rate of 300 million. The $350 million that I referred to is our total productivity for our supply chain across all of the company for fiscal 2015 and probably subsequent years also as what we talked about at CAGNY last year. So 300 million run-rate by fiscal 2017 for Ralcorp synergies, total productivity and supply chain this year of about 350 million.","This year and as it relates to our Private Brands business. We\u2019re probably looking at something in the range of a $125 million to $150 million for productivity there most -- big chunk of that is synergies.","Operator","We will take our question now from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Congratulations on a sequential progress. I was hoping I could understand some of the drivers of the profit erosion in private label little bit more. When you disclose sales growth of one on 3% volume decline implicitly we\u2019re talking about 1% price growth but you\u2019re referencing price concession. So how do I foot those two numbers?","Gary Rodkin","Yes let me start with that Jason. So, we made as we have talked a lot about, we were on our heels very reactive last year and those price concessions that we made are still with us. So those are in our base but as we move forward and we start to selectively manage our mix and we take some pricing on some of the new business that starts to eat into those price concessions and that\u2019s why we have got that dynamic. Paul?","Paul Maass","Yes and the other element I would mention John referenced in his remarks supply chain initiatives and the picture I will paint it's really about taking one step back to take two steps forward. We\u2019re changing our broad [ph] distribution network to optimize how we execute there. In the short term that adds costs but in the long term it puts us in an advantage position to execute the business. We\u2019re also consolidating production at certain plants, increases capacity utilization. Again these are expensive things to execute that hurts the profit performance in the short term but really positions us better in the longer term and that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving against and that\u2019s what you see coming through.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Do you guys have a sense of the magnitude of these incremental costs that may prove transitory that you are not excluding as onetime items?","John Gehring ","Jason, I believe in the range of $30 million this year.","Operator","We will take our question now from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets","My first question is on Consumer Foods and the advertising promotion expense. I know you had a tough lap, what's the expectation for the year? And Gary, since you've been on at ConAgra, in-charge rather, you've tried to increase advertising promotion generally over a longer term. Are you resetting that now to a much lower level? I mean what's the number for this year and what's the sustainable advertising promotion number for the Consumer Foods business? And with the lower number this year what impact might that have on sales?","Gary Rodkin","You know philosophically I would say the most important thing -- two things, one last year we spent heavily on some new product introductions that didn\u2019t live up to expectations and that out of the numbers this year so that\u2019s a big impact. Maybe more importantly we\u2019re working smarter and deploying our resources more judiciously and that\u2019s really about demanding and raising the bar for our folks to say, if we are going to spend the resources we need to see the growth that comes along with it. So Tom, maybe some more details.","Tom McGough","Sure. As Gary said, as with any investment we make we have a very sharp ROI focus on allocating those resources. Given the breadth of our portfolio, we are investing but we\u2019re going to get the highest returns. Those include many of the businesses that Gary highlighted earlier, Marie Callender, a tomato crop [ph] platform, crop platform, Slim Jim, Reddi-wip. We will continue to invest, but we\u2019re getting a very strong ROI. Overall our FY \u201915 spending for the balance of the year will be roughly in-line with year ago levels.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Just on Private Brands, are you in a position now to look at this business since it's stabilized in terms of its performance, look at it longer term and give us some guidance in what a long term margin profile for this could look like? I mean your long term targets imply that we should get somewhere close to double digit segment EBIT margins on Private Brands, but is that something that's achievable?","Chris Klinefelter","As you know from our statements we expect modest growth this year for things to accelerate over \u201916 and \u201917. In terms of giving a hard number we haven't cited one, but I can tell you is reaching double digits in a reasonable amount of time of long term is not out of the question.","Operator","We will move now to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","A couple of questions. One is on the synergies for the Private Brands business, the 300 million. I'm sure you've addressed this before, but to what extent does that entail consolidating the Private Brands supply chain with the Consumer Foods supply chain? Have you announced those types of steps yet, if there are any at all? And the reason I ask, Gary, is that I'm sure that the Board in the future will continue to evaluate the role of Private Brands in the portfolio. And as you integrate them together, perhaps you even take the step to pull them apart at some point? And then I had a quick follow-up?","Gary Rodkin","Yes let me just tell you that our objective is to really leverage the infrastructure that we have that\u2019s what we have talked about when we made the acquisition and we still are aligned through the Board on that strategy but John?","John Gehring","Yes just a follow-up we have done a lot of integration I think you know this year for instance the big portion of the ramp-up in our synergies is coming from procurement and it's really leveraging the buy of really common materials across all of those businesses and then certainly from rolling out our manufacturing cost savings initiatives within the plants we really are doing a fair amount of integration of these businesses and the supply chains in particular. Other thing you think about things like distribution networks and how we move product to customer. So there is an awful lot of progress we have made there and more to come but clearly we\u2019re looking at a total supply chain.","Gary Rodkin","Rob, one other thing I would just mention as you think about it on a go forward basis, most of our competitors are pretty small in Private Brands and when you think about total delivered cost and ultimately and this is going to take a bit longer but ultimately the total delivered cost just from a logistics standpoint of being able to combine loads and deliver is certainly going to be an advantage for us. So that\u2019s just one other example of what we have to look forward to. ","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. I get it. My follow-up was about the R&D capabilities in the private label business. Your competitor in private label talks a lot about how they use their R&D and marketing capability to come up with ways to segment the market for their private label customers. Gary, you gave a lot of good detail on private label during the quarter, but I was wondering, if you get these new business wins, are they asking you to leverage your R&D capability to come up with new product ideas or premium versions or is it just like you are bidding for business and you're displacing someone else?","Paul Maass","I would just describe national brand emulation is a critical part. We have really strong capabilities especially of the categories that we\u2019re in as a core competence that is required for success, effective interaction with our customers and developing the right products. So leveraging our total R&D capabilities across our company is absolutely part of our total value proposition and we believe it gives us competitive advantage and we\u2019re leaning into it and frankly back on the comments on the supply chain, I would put supply chain in that same realm and the same outlook. It's a strong capability, we\u2019re leveraging it to help us win over the long haul.","Gary Rodkin","Yes I mean so the sweating the assets clearly important. Getting the emulation right, that\u2019s kind of the bread and butter of the business but clearly our customers are really excited about our capabilities on the innovation side, that\u2019s to come as we go forward, we dabbled in that in a small way thus far and have some wins there but that\u2019s going to become a bigger piece of the business as we go forward particularly as the customers go up market.","Operator","And Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research has our next question.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","I wanted to come at the margin question on Private Brands a little bit different way. If we go back to -- I mean forget about the run-up between -- around the time of the transaction -- but we will take an average of \u201908 through 2012. If you look at the legacy Ralcorp business, pre-synergy you were looking at excluding the branded side of that business, excluding the post-acquisition of theirs and anything related to that. You were talking about 10% to 12% operating margins -- segment margins and so 2% of that was corporate overhead. So level is already higher than what you are reporting and talking about and then, you take another $300 million I mean significantly, 500, 600 basis points incremental in terms of the legacy Ralcorp sales to where that is.","So, I'm trying to bridge maybe where -- have competitive conditions changed that you just can't sustain those kinds of margins and so that 12%, 13% isn't attainable? How much of this is temporary dislocation related to the problems last year and how much of this is any change in the marketplace that might have happened due to higher commodity prices, more competition from brands? Just your thoughts on that, Gary? Thanks.","Chris Klinefelter","First thing I will remind you of is that the -- we have taken some portion of the former Ralcorp and it exists in more than just the Private Brands segment. So there is going to be some difficulty in drawing a trail from before and after. And that same statement also applies to our synergies. Jonathan all of our synergies are not just going to hit the Private Brands segment, they are going to hit other spots but to get the sort of the substantive part of your question, I mean last year, we certainly had some unusual conditions that put us at a different level of profitability. So right now we\u2019re still in a period of recovering from that and so when we talk about things getting better going forward we are not -- again not necessarily we\u2019re trying to cite some reference point that wasn't our company, but we do have a lot of cite to things being a heck a lot better than they are now. Double digits are not out of the question over some reasonable period of time but to trace it back to former entity is just -- it's not a reference point for us. Paul?","Paul Maass","Yes and just a little color, I would start with our current margin performance is not acceptable and our focus is on improving it. A lot of effort around the top line working with customers and just basic blocking and tackling - filling distribution voids, gaining new business, getting it in market all the things that we talked about from a supply chain leveraging our R&D capabilities. So we\u2019re making progress, there is sequential improvement, feel good about the outlook but also acknowledge that the current margin structure is not where it needs to be and the one that we haven't hit on much is pricing and we\u2019re surgical pricing low margin SKUs that\u2019s an element of it and that where we were a year ago we had to give a lot of pricing and that was just a situation we were in, but we\u2019re fundamentally changing it and know we have to get a better outcome.","Operator","And we will hear a question now from Alexia Howard with Sanford C. Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company ","Can I ask about the progress that you're making on what you've termed the troubled brands before? I think a while ago, you were saying it's very hard to recruit new consumers into those brands. From your comments today, it looks as though they are still seeing negative sales growth. I'm not sure how negative that is, but it sounds as though you\u2019re making progress. Was it as simple as just putting the little snap-top lids on the Chef Boyardee? Or is there merchandising, pricing, other marketing or innovation activity that's allowing you to see a bit of progress there? And will we see positive growth on those brands at some point soon? Thank you.","Tom McGough","","As you have highlighted we have talked a lot about these brands, we have been working to stabilize the three businesses of Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice, and Orville Redenbacher's and it is focused on getting the fundamentals right and being perfect at retail. In Q1, we made very tangible progress in improving the trends. Specifically on Chef Boyardee it's been a combination of two factors, certainly adding our easy open lid to the product has improved our non-promoted velocities, but we have also been more effective in our in-store merchandising. On Healthy Choice, while the nutritional segment continues to be challenging we\u2019re transforming our product line around Cafe Steamers, which is a very proprietary format for us. It's growing at strong double digit rates. This is work we\u2019re going to continue throughout FY \u201915 and then finally on Orville Redenbacher we will be fielding several initiatives in the latter part of this calendar year to get those fundamentals right and we anticipate improving trends in the second half. Microwave popcorn is a category that we believe and we\u2019re confident we can grow and I think you can see that in our Act II performance that we\u2019re posting very significant year-on-year increases in our consumption as we have gotten the fundamentals right on that business.","So overall we expect to see continued sequential improvement from these brands as we progress through the year.","Operator","There are no further questions Mr. Klinefelter. I will hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","So thank you. This concludes our call today and just as a reminder this is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release and as always we\u2019re available for discussions.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year FY '16 earnings. I'm pleased with our results which reflect the progress we're making as we continue to execute our strategy to drive focus and discipline across the Company. Diluted comparable EPS for FY '16 was $2.08, compared with $1.93 in FY '15 which included an extra week. For the fourth quarter, we delivered comparable EPS of $0.52, slightly above our $0.50 guidance. Before John and I get into details of our full year and Q4 results, I want to provide you with a bit of context and perspective on where we're as we continue to build the foundation to support ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston as separate, pure play businesses following the spin plan for later this year. It's been a very busy year and I'm pleased with the way the Organization has embraced the changes needed to drive value across ConAgra. We have not only implemented many of the structural changes necessary to create a more focused Company, but we have materially evolved our culture, adopting the discipline, focus and performance orientation we need to succeed going forward. We began the year with an aggressive agenda and accomplished a tremendous amount. You've heard me discuss many of our accomplishments throughout the year and we haven't let up. We have much more to do to fully optimize our business which will take time, but we're committed to the challenge. Consistent with our efforts to become a more focused Company, over the last several weeks we reached agreements to sell two terrific businesses that will be better served by more focused ownership, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank. We will receive combined proceeds from these sales of approximately $480 million. These divestitures will sharpen our attention around our core product portfolio to drive sustainable growth and the sales of Spicetec and JM Swank further position us to execute a smooth separation into two pure play companies, ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston, in the coming months. We expect to utilize the proceeds from the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan which includes debt reduction, an attractive dividend, share repurchases and acquisitions. In addition to bringing more focused, the actions we took during the year enabled us to reduce our debt by approximately $2.5 billion and our balance sheet is much stronger than it was just 12 months ago. Since we last spoke in Q3, we've also continued to build momentum around our $300-million efficiency plan and our efforts to transform ConAgra into a lean, agile and more focused Company in order to improve profitability and unlock shareholder value. We recognize there's still more to do on this front and we continue to expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in FY '17 and FY '18. As part of our transformation to a more leaner and nimble Company, we're settling into our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago. In fact for, the first time, we're conducting this call from our new space. We moved in early this week and we're excited to have the Leadership Team and our consumer business under one roof. It's a great new space and our Team is energized and the more open floor plan will foster enhanced collaboration and accelerate our shift to a more innovative and tightly connected culture which will play a key role in driving performance and in creating value. Our Team also remains hard at work on the separation of ConAgra into two public pure play companies. We expect to file the initial Form 10 by the middle of July and will be hosting Investor Days for both companies in advance of the completion of the spin. We will be following up later this Summer with more specifics regarding the date, times and locations for those meetings. Our teams are working diligently to prepare ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston for their lives as standalone public companies. We remain highly confident that this is the right path to maximize value for stakeholders, who will benefit from improved operating performance and consistency from both businesses.","With FY '16 complete, the Team is proud of our accomplishments on behalf of shareholders and we now begin FY '17 ready to build on our momentum. It will take time to truly optimize ConAgra, but this Team has developed the refuse-to-lose attitude that I believe will enable our success. So on to our segment performance. As you know, our focus in Consumer Foods is on unlocking the significant latent potential of the business by expanding margins, improving brand health and delivering more consistent performance. We have aggressively executed against that strategy during FY '16 by allocating resources more efficiently through portfolio segmentation with a focus on building a higher-quality investment-grade volume base. At the same time, we're becoming more effective in pricing, mix management and trade promotion productivity and more efficient from a supply chain perspective. These advancements, coupled with favorable commodity input costs, provided us with fuel to grow profits, reinvest in the business and position our volume base for the long term. Clearly, we still is have more to do to realize our full potential as a branded food company. That said, we've made tremendous progress by re-igniting our operating performance this year. For the year, sales declined as we expected, consistent with our efforts to upgrade our volume base, take selective pricing actions were justified and improve our trade spend discipline. As we said early in the year, the payoff was going to be in margins, not sales and our results reflected our progress against that objective. Gross margins expanded, providing good fuel to reinvest in the business. For the full fiscal year, comparable operating margin grew to just under 17%, almost a 200-basis-point improvement over last year and comparable operating profit grew 7% to $1.2 billion, overall, a strong performance by the Team. In addition, we made progress throughout the year as we invested behind A&P Reddi brands, like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender's, PAM, Bertolli, Slim Jim and Hunt's. For the year, we increased A&P spending 12%, including 8% in Q4. Importantly, we have developed a much more rigorous and targeted approach to allocating these dollars against brands where we can drive the greatest margin impact. Our results for the quarter mirrored our results for the full year, as we experienced a 5% decline in net sales after adjusting for the benefit of the extra week last year, principally driven by volume declines related to the actions we're taking on pricing and trade spend. In fact, virtually all of the volume decline was a result of Banquet pricing associated with product upgrades and a broader portfolio decision to walk away from promoted volume that offered weak returns and conditioned the consumer to look for deep discounts. Once again, this was planned as we successfully expanded gross margins, allowing us to increase our brand investments and strengthen our non-promoted volume base. Operating margins also increased during quarter to slightly over 17%. Although comparable operating profit declined for the quarter to $290 million, this was a function of the extra week in the prior year, FX and the volume impact of pricing and trade actions, partially offset by lower SG&A. Expanding operating margin was our goal for the quarter and our focus on price mix and supply chain and SG&A productivity delivered results. Our FY '16 results are a testament to the fact that our strategy is working. Importantly, we're at the early stages of what we can achieve as a standalone business and I'm more encouraged than ever about the work happening in Consumer Foods and the significant opportunity ahead as we continue to accelerate our progress. As I've said before, discipline and investment create a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands lead to better pricing power and higher margins and we're clearly on the right path to maximizing value here. We look forward to sharing much more with you on ConAgra Brands at the Investor Day this fall.","Now, turning to Commercial Foods, for the year, net sales were approximately $4 billion, up slightly from the prior year. Operating profit was approximately $630 million, up nearly 12% from the prior year. Fourth quarter net sales were approximately $1 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year, due principally to the 53rd week in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $156 million, in line with the year-ago results. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, supported by food-away-from-home trends in the U.S. as well as growing demand in emerging markets. Consistent with our plans to capitalize on these trends, we recently announced an important investment in our Richland, Washington facility to expand our domestic production capacity which we also leverage for exports. We also announced an exciting investment in Russia by our Lamb Weston\/Meijer joint venture. These investments will enhance our ability to support the increasing consumer demand for value-added potato products and the steady growth in key emerging markets like Russia. Ultimately, we expect these investments will contribute to our ability to continue to grow our share and deliver strong top- and bottom-line results for shareholders. More broadly, we continue to make good progress in preparing Lamb Weston to become a standalone business. We will be providing more details in the weeks to come. Before I turn it over to John, as always, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the resilience and dedication of our talented Team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent Company with a more valuable future. While FY '16 was a year of significant change, we remain a work in progress.","That said, I'm more confident than ever as we look ahead and I greatly appreciate the energy and focus on serving our customers that I see on display on a daily basis. Over to you, John.","John Gehring","Thank you, Sean and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics, including a recap of our 2016 fiscal fourth quarter performance; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and some brief comments on our outlook for FY '17. I'll start with some comments on our performance in our fiscal fourth quarter. Overall, we reported a loss of $0.07 per share from continuing operations, compared with $0.54 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the prior-year quarter. The decrease from prior year is principally driven by a substantial noncash charge related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts.","I'll provide some additional comments on this pension charge when I discuss comparability items. After adjusting for this charge and other items impacting comparability, diluted EPS from continuing operations for the fiscal fourth quarter was $0.52, slightly better than we had planned and modestly below the $0.55 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, the prior fiscal year and fourth quarter included an additional week which added roughly $0.04 per share to the EPS base. In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter, down about 12% from the year-ago period.","We estimate that the extra week impacted Consumer Foods sales and volume by approximately 7%. After adjusting for the benefit of the extra week in the prior year, net sales declined 5%, reflecting a 4% decline in volume, flat price mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $290 million in the fourth quarter, versus $324 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline in comparable earnings reflects lower volumes, including the impact of the extra week in the year-ago quarter and a negative FX impact of about 2%, partially offset by lower SG&A. For the fiscal fourth quarter, operating margin, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded modestly, driven by a slightly larger increase in gross margins.","While the year-over-year comparable margin expansion slowed this quarter, we note that the FY '15 fourth quarter delivered very strong margin expansion and during that quarter, we began to see the impacts from our margin expansion efforts. For the full year, operating margins, adjusted for items impacting comparability, expanded over 180 basis points reflecting pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable input costs, offset by higher marketing and incentive costs. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $64 million, up about 8% from the prior-year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.","Foreign exchange this fiscal quarter had negative impacts of $15 million on net sales and about $7 million on operating profit. In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or about 6% below the prior-year quarter, principally reflecting the impact of the extra week in the year-ago period. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $151 million, versus $154 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects the impact of the extra week in the prior year and higher incentives expense, partially offset by good sales and margin performance in our Lamb Weston business. Equity method investment earnings were $31 million for the current quarter and $30 million in the year-ago period.","Moving on to corporate expenses, for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $414 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million, in line with the year-ago quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings efforts, offset by higher incentives expense. On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we're making good progress and we expect to realize the majority of our $200 million of SG&A cost savings over the next two years. Further, as I have previously noted, the benefit of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in our Consumer business and we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can both offset modest stranded costs as they arise and selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.","Discontinued operations posted diluted EPS of $0.34 in the fourth quarter. Substantially all of the earnings relate to a $147-million tax benefit associated with the recognition of a portion of the capital loss carry forward asset resulting from the sale of the Private Label operations earlier this year. We expect to utilize the $147 million of capital loss asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to the recently announced divestitures of our Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and our JM Swank business which are expected to be completed during the first quarter of FY '17.","On comparability items, this quarter included several items as follows. First, we had approximately $0.49 per diluted share of net expense related to the year-end remeasurement of pension amounts. This charge is related to the accounting change we made several years ago whereby we elected to immediately recognize significant actuarial gains and losses in our P&L rather than amortize them over time. The non-cash charge this year is driven by the drop in interest rates and therefore our discount rate and some lower returns on investments over the short term. Importantly, we remain comfortable with our current funding levels. In addition to this item, we also had approximately $0.07 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for our Chef Boyardee brand, driven by our plans to improve the quality of the volume base which we expect to result in lower net sales over the near term.","Next, we had approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the previously announced planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. We also had approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net gain related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs, temporarily classified in unallocated corporate expense. Finally, we had several smaller items, including approximately $0.01 per diluted share of expense for recent developments in a legacy legal matter, approximately $0.01 per diluted share of benefit from selling certain assets within the Commercial Foods segment, approximately $0.01 per diluted share expense for adjustments to prior-year tax credits and about $0.01 of rounding. ","On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $835 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows from continuing operations for FY '16 were approximately $1.05 billion, versus $1.22 billion in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $150 million, versus $103 million in the prior-year quarter. Net interest expense was $61 million in the fiscal fourth quarter, versus $88 million in the year-ago quarter and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $109 million, versus $107 million in the prior-year quarter.","On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. For the year, we repaid approximately $2.5 billion of debt, mainly from the proceeds from the sale of the Private Label operations earlier this year. During the fiscal fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Also, the Company recently announced agreements to sell its Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings business and the JM Swank business, each of which is part of the Commercial Foods segment. The transactions are expected to generate combined proceeds of approximately $480 million and both transactions are expected to close during the fiscal first quarter of 2017.","As previously noted, we plan to utilize approximately $147 million of our capital loss carryforwards to substantially eliminate taxes that would otherwise be payable in connection with these sales. Also, the remaining capital loss of approximately $3.6 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax, is available to offset capital gains over the next five years. We remain confident that the Company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. These proceeds are expected to be utilized as part of our broader balanced capital allocation plan. ","Now, I'd like to provide a few comments on our outlook for FY '17. First of all, given the pending Lamb Weston spinoff, we're not in position today to provide EPS guidance for the full fiscal year. As we have noted, we believe our Investor Days will be the proper form ever forum to provide both FY '17 and long term guidance for both companies. Further, on the timing of the spinoff, we're on schedule to complete the spin this fall. We expect to file a Form 10 over the next couple of weeks and once we get further into the Form 10 process later this summer, we expect to be in a position to provide dates for our Investor Days.","For FY '17, while we're not in a position to provide full-year EPS guidance, I would note the following. For Q1 FY '17, we expect EPS growth to be in the mid to high teens from our earnings base of $0.41, driven by continued focus on margin management across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments, continued strong top-line performance in our Commercial Foods segment, increased benefits from our cost savings programs and lower interest costs. We will also continue to invest in capabilities to strengthen and position our brands for stronger growth over the long term. ","Overall we expect the positive trends from our FY '16 to continue into FY '17. We look forward to building out our long term expectations at our Investor Days, at which time, we can provide more details about portfolio segmentation and expectations for top-line growth, margin expansion, capital allocation of financial policies, phasing of our SG&A and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets, as well as the short term impacts of any stranded costs associated with the planned Lamb Weston spinoff. In closing, we're pleased with our FY '16 performance and the changes we were able to execute to improve the long term health of the Company. We still have a lot of work to do, but we're confident we're taking the right actions to drive attractive value creation over time. That concludes our formal remarks.","Before I turn it back over to Sean, I just wanted to briefly address my pending retirement. I'm excited to begin the next phase of my life and am looking forward to the opportunity to allocate more time to my family and interests outside of business. I'm equally excited, though, about the future of this Company. I've enjoyed seeing new Team come together under Sean's leadership and I'm confident that the Company is on the right track. It's been a privilege to work at ConAgra Foods for the past 14-plus years and to have served as its CFO for the last 7.5. Lastly, I will miss the relationships I've developed with many of you in the analyst and investor community over the years and I appreciate your interest in the Company and the insights and questions you've shared over the years. Now, let me turn it back over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, John. Before we turn things over to the Q&A section, I'd just like to say how grateful we're for John's many years of distinguished service to our Company. Johns has been an outstanding CFO, leader and friend and John, we wish you the very best of luck in your next chapter.","With that, Operator, let's move to the Q&A please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar","One of the key strategies you've embarked on is the Consumer segment de-emphasizing the non-investment grade volume in favor of margins and returns and we've seen that obviously manifest itself on the top line with lower volumes but higher price mix. So I was a little surprised to see that price mix in the quarter was flat despite the more significant volume decline in the quarter, so was there any specific reason I guess discrete this quarter that we didn't see more of that come through and then in the forward-looking commentary for the first quarter, price mix was one of the things listed that was expected to be a positive contributor so maybe what's expected to drive that improvement sequentially versus what the pricing that did not come through in the fourth quarter?","Tom McGough","Let me just kind of set the background on price mix. We think about pricing in terms of three components, the first is inflation justified, the second, proven by trade productivity and the third pricing in conjunction with brand and quality upgrades that we made. When you look at Q4 there are several things that are affecting price mix in the quarter. Our pricing activities are focused on how do we increase our overall margin which we did in the quarter. So in terms of inflation justified pricing we're being more disciplined and timely in pricing for commodity changes both up and down. As you know the vast majority of our brands are not in pass through categories but there are a categories that tend to be pass-through and one of those is fresh meat and in Q4 we saw protein deflation that we pass through on brands like Hebrew National and Odom's Tennessee Pride.","So that was a deflationary, we built our overall margins. We continue to make progress on the second piece in terms of our trade productivity, we've committed to $100 million of productivity savings that's going to show itself up into additional gross margin which we saw in the quarter. You see it in the measured results we're making progress in lowering our percent on deal and you'll continue to see positive impact of that forward.","And then finally when we restage a brand like Banquet which we\u2019ve talked about we'll increase our price with those product upgrades. In this quarter we also launched a line of organic Healthy Choice steamers at premium pricing so that was a positive contributor. So what you see overall is the impact of this pricing end market, higher average price, lower promoted volumes and importantly a healthier more profitable non-promoted base. So overtime I think what you can expect is that our pricing margins will move up while there may be some quarter on quarter variations.","Operator","We'll move now to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","One quick one and then if I can sneak that one in then my more fundamental question. John, are you planning on sticking around until the next CFO has been identified? I was a bit confused because your comments today seem to suggest you may be departing a bit sooner than that?","A \u2013 John Gehring","No, I will be here and I will work with the new CFO when he or she comes on Board and we will have a very full transition process so there will be plenty of overlap.","Ken Goldman","And then I guess my question is this in terms of the consumer segment margin -- I realize you were up -- you talked about some of this and I realized you were up against a tougher comparison in the fourth quarter but if we go back even if we look at a two year basis the pace of margin improvement did slow fairly meaningfully from Q3 and you talked about certain things like FX, but you also did just mention cheaper meat which usually is a tail-wind for margins. So I'm just curious if you could really help us sort of bucket some of those margin headwinds you faced in the quarter and which of these you think will stick around into 1Q perhaps?","Tom McGough","So just for background, expanding margins is a foundation of building stronger brands and accelerating our growth in the future and that's an ongoing continuous process. As we talked about there's a lot of components in terms of margin, there's certainly the pricing components, there's the productivity component, there's improvement in mix and then margin growth through renovation and innovation. So only the first really inflation justified pricing is only one component of margin but we did see some deflation of protein. In light of that we did see overall gross margins expand from the other component of our plan, particularly productivity lower commodities. I think you see end market our average price per unit is increasing and our margins were up as a result of this holistic approach. Over time our margins are going to grow, there's going to be quarter on quarter variations but we're committed to continue to drive a holistic approach to the margin expansion.","A \u2013 Sean Connolly","I think one of the keys is as we pursue margin expansion we pursue higher quality volume base. We're not going to get overly exercised about some variability from quarter to quarter because every quarter has got a bit of a different story to it whether it's wrap, whether it's seasonality, whether it's the mix of products that we've got moving through it. The fact of the matter is our absolute margins and consumer continue to be in a significantly improved position versus where they've been historically and that's because of the discipline that we're driving and you know we're going to continue to drive that discipline here in the next couple of quarters because we've got a [indiscernible] out of our base some behaviors that we're not adding to value.","So you're going to continue to see as we've talked before we want to see the center line of our profitability move north over time. There may be some variability around that quarter to quarter based on the dynamics of the quarter we're in but our goal is to drive the center line north over time and reduce the standard deviation around that center line and we continue to feel excellent about kind of the progress we're making in the path we're on.","Operator","Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley has our next question.","John Colantuon ","This is John calling in for Matt. There has been some recent speculation around the potential for Lamb Weston to potentially be sold rather than spun. Without commenting on any specific transactions can you just address whether you're still open to potential alternative transactions for that specific asset and is there anything that you would lead -- would there be anything that would rule out you leading \u2013 would there be anything that would rule out you divesting the business at this stage rather than spinning it off?","A \u2013 Sean Connolly","Well I appreciate you not asking to comment on rumor or speculation because we wouldn't be able to do that but I will reiterate that we're and we have been focused squarely focused on value maximization. We remain highly confident that our planned spin does the best job of meeting that objective. I've also said that many times that if something real and clearly superior were to emerge we would be open minded but the fact is we feel great about the spin and have all of our energy focused on executing that with excellence.","Operator","We'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Looking at the Commercial Foods segment, a little bit of a deceleration at the top line and just a couple of questions within that, first, you\u2019re broadly kind of what's going on pricing versus volume in that and regionally if there's any other special details in there and secondly, it looks like you sold about 11% of the annual revenues of that business and these two transactions, was there anything outsized in those two businesses that presumably were part of that base and won't be going forward that may be affected that top line trend in commercial this quarter. Thanks very much and congratulations, John.","A \u2013 Tom Werner","This is Tom Werner. Commercial Foods, the fundamentals of the business remain intact and I think your deceleration question is referring to Q3 to Q4 I'm assuming. If you remember in Q3, this year, we were lapping the port impact from prior year and that was significant volume and sales contributor to Q3 no question about it. On a comparable basis, in Q4 total commercial, we saw modest single digit low single digit growth volume and sales and the business fundamentally are in good shape going forward, feel really good about the growth prospects.","Jonathan Feeney","And anything specific about the businesses you sold trend wise versus the business you're keeping?","A \u2013 Tom Werner","No, they performed really well in FY '16. You know and as Sean mentioned we feel excited about their path going forward with their new owners.","Operator","We'll move now to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Two quick ones for me first, the Form 10 now going to be filed in Mid July, John can you just -- I think previously you were thinking about late Spring so can you just give us some color in terms of why it's taking a little longer to file it?","A \u2013 John Gehring","I think that it's just the process of going through all of the carve out financial statements and as I'm sure you're familiar with 410s there's a lot of comprehensive information that has to be gathered at a much different level of detail that is just taking a little bit longer. So I don't think there's anything significant there. We feel good about the timetable.","Obviously, there's a significant SEC review process that probably adds some variability to the time as we go forward but as I indicated, I think we're going to monitor that process closely and then like I said by the end of the Summer we should have a better opportunity to bracket precise timing on the close as well as the Investor Day, but nothing significant other than just the volume work required to get the document put together.","Bryan Spillane","And then just the second one in terms of the $300 million of targeted savings, can you just give us a sense just how much you've already realized maybe what was in the quarter and how much you've realized so far to date?","A \u2013 John Gehring","I'd say for the year for fiscal 16 I think we were something north of $50 million, might be a little bit more than that and then as obviously as we\u2019ve said as we get into fiscal '17 and '18 we would expect to see and again I'm speaking right now the $200 million of SG&A. So we would expect to see the lion share of the SG&A in '17 and '18. I would tell you we would expect to see some ramp up in SG&A savings as we go through FY '17 because as we enter the year we still have some duplicate costs as people transition in new jobs and people transition out of the same jobs, for instance. So I think we feel good about the lion share of that going forward and then on the trade phasing I might ask Tom or Sean to comment briefly on any significant insights there.","A \u2013 Sean Connolly","Sure, our process in terms of trade spending is going to be a perpetual process of using advanced analytics to measure, learn and improve our spending. Certainly over the course of this fiscal year we've made fairly significant improvement and you'll continue to see those in the upcoming periods.","Operator","We'll move now to Citigroup's David Driscoll.","David Driscoll","Just a couple of details and then a question for you, Sean. Just wanted to know, could you quantify what the benefit from lower input cost was in the quarter? And then is there any concern just about comping that next year? And then in the guidance, the double-digit number -- apologies guys, maybe you don't want to answer this -- but is that like 10% to 12% or does that mean 10% to 15%? I just don't know what the double digit means or how to appropriately deal with that for the Q1 guidance.","And then Sean, the big picture question for you is, clearly, your enthusiasm is loud and clear. The volume losses, though, from an outside perspective, they do sometimes worry us and I'm just concerned about shelf space losses and does it mean that you have to put in a sizeable marketing investment to start to moderate these things in FY '17 and FY '18. Thank you.","John Gehring","I was trying to write all that down, so I may miss something here. But let me start with the Q1 FY '17 double digits. As I clarified in my script, we're looking at that to be in the mid to upper teens. I recognize that double digits probably means anything from 10 to 99, so I think if you think in terms of mid to upper teens, that's probably the range that would help you tighten up that range. I think you asked a question about deflation in the quarter. I'd say it was fairly modest. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but commodities probably showed a little bit of favorability. Our conversion costs were probably up a little bit.","As we look forward to FY '17, I would say we probably are looking at continued benign commodity markets as we sit here today, that probably means we may still have some modest inflation just because we're coming off such a low base of commodities, but overall, we feel pretty good about the commodity inputs for FY '17 as well as our -- we'll have some conversion cost inflation which is not the majority of our COGS. But the important thing is, to the extent we have inflation or commodity moves, I think as Tom has indicated and Sean has certainly indicated, our muscles and our capabilities around pricing and expanding margins in the face of either increasing or decreasing margins is much better than it was even a few years ago. So I think the whole margin management capability and the holistic capability for us to manage margins higher as commodities move around is much stronger.","Sean Connolly","David, let me address the point you're making out of volume because I think this is a critical point. First of all, if you look at our overall story in Consumer, as I've said many times, we've got to remember this is a transformation we're undergoing here, not a flip of the switch. And on volume in particular, the bottom line is this. It is an undeniable fact that our past promotional practices have embedded in our volume base a group of consumers who are not brand loyal, who only buy on hot deals and who contribute virtually nothing to our profitability.","It's also true that by catering to them, we have underserved the bulk of our volume base and these are consumers who would be willing to pay more for more contemporary, higher-quality offerings. The good news here around this whole dynamic is that it's reversible if we're willing to stick to our principles around optimizing mix and also refreshing the targeted brands for a new day. No one said this was going to be easy, but it is absolutely the right way to manage a branded asset for value creation. We know from years of experience what the alternative gets us and that's precisely why we do not get spooked when we see volumes pull back and margins expand.","It's exactly what we expect [indiscernible]. In fact, I think in Q4, the volume backoff in Consumer was in the ballpark of 3.7% which frankly, in the scheme of what we're trying to do of purging some of these really bad deep-discount promotional behaviors, is frankly small in my mind. So that is a key point. The end game here is obviously what we're all about which is stronger brands, better innovation, better margins and ultimately, stronger growth and shareholder returns. And recall in the last year, we recruited a new Chief Growth Officer to run our Growth Center of Excellence and he is quite busy installing new work processes and raising our overall capability in this area.","I'm looking forward to sharing some of these updates with you guys at Investor Day, but overall, I am quite optimistic around what the Growth Center of Excellence in partnership with our brands will be able to accomplish in this portfolio. In the meantime, we will absolutely let some of this non-investment-grade volume go and we will happily take the associated margin expansion.","Operator","We'll move next to David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Really following up on that, you mentioned the $100 million opportunity in promotion and spending and efficiency. How much did ConAgra decrease in its promotion spending in FY '16 and how, specifically, did the Company achieve this? Was this predominantly in frozen entrees and done in conjunction with SKU rationalization? And I have a follow-up.","Sean Connolly","Let me make one general comment and I'll turn it over to Tom to give you some specific comments. ConAgra historically has probably been the least disciplined Company in our space with respect to taking pricing when it's justified, but also we've probably been the most over reliant in terms of deep discount trade and we clearly need to undo that. But what I find interesting is you really see that in the scanner data right now.","If you look at the percent of our total volume base sold on deal past 52 weeks, past 26, past 12 and past four, you see sequential reductions in percent of our volumes sold on deal, to the point where we've gone from being one of the most over promoted companies in our is space to one of the leaders and obviously, as we do that we're going to see volume impact, we're going to see efficiency, but we're also going to have to reinvest behind the brands in other ways which is what we've done this year as you look at our A&P spend and increase year on year, but with respect to the $100-million program that you're talking about, like the SG&A program, it will build sequentially across 2016, 2017 and 2018 and a big part of that is because we're getting our sea legs.","We're going from being fairly rough around the edges so to speak in terms of our capabilities here to much more system-based, much more analytical and once you develop the database on what's working, what's not, it's that virtuous cycle you improve on it. So small amount of improvement in this past year, ramping up this year and continuing to ramp up through 2018. I miss anything there Tom?","Tom McGough","I think what I would add is we talk about $100 million of productivity improvement. That's likely going to come through margin expansion and not necessarily lower spending. This is not simply about cutting trade spending. It's about using advanced analytics to develop programs that have higher impact and better returns for both ourselves and our customers. So we measure our progress in terms of margin expansion and not so much in terms of the absolute amount of money we spend on trade.","David Palmer ","And my follow-up on that is it strikes me this reminds me a little of Kraft Heinz where it looked like you are building capabilities at the same time you're ripping off band-aids that are more obvious opportunities but perhaps have volume consequences. So in other words, perhaps going forward, you think you might be smarter at shifting trade promotions into the better ones, whereas earlier on, this had to do a little bit with just cutting unprofitable volume and taking that hit. Is that a fair characterization of what's going on?","Sean Connolly","There should be a mix shift over time, certainly, but let me just address something that somebody may have mentioned before and perhaps we didn't hit it, but it comes up on every call and I just want to address it head on which is should you guys expect a rebase from us in terms of A&P spend as we back off trade and things like that and I just don't see a rebase in front of us. We're a year into our game plan. We're making progress.","We're going to keep working at the fundamentals here because we feel really good about what we're seeing. We certainly have more to do, but it's not like we're in inning one and we need to double down and wildly ratchet up our A&P in a sudden way. I just don't see that for us. We're going to do this in a thoughtful, analytical, disciplined way and if there's a migration, it will be an orderly migration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Akshay Jagdale","Just two questions, first one is for Sean and the other is for John. But this first question is bigger picture in terms of your portfolio segmentation process, Sean. I know you are not ready to give us all of the details of what's going to happen, but can you just give us some insights on where you are timing-wise in that process and the only evidence we have seen as a function of that process is you decided to fix Banquet. You're selling some ancillary brands or businesses that you have.","So those are the biggest things we see so far. Is that a fair assessment? And so just can you give us some insights into timing and where you are really in the process and maybe big buckets in which we should think about your portfolio, like fix, sell, ready for A&P and so on and so forth, anything that would be helpful and then for John, just on the business that you just sold, the Spicetec business, I believe you said it was $470 million in sales. There was some pretty vague commentary on profitability. If you could give us some insights into how much the EBIT was that you're losing from that, that would be very helpful. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Let me touch on portfolio segmentation. First of all, we will go deep on that with our investors at Investor Day and we'll have Darren Serrao literally walk through how we went about the process, because if you look at our branded portfolio, we have roughly 50 brands and unlike the old days, we're not going to take a first-horse-to-the-trough approach to resources around here on those 50 brands. We will be very disciplined around the roles each of those brands play in creating value.","The simplest way to think about it is, first, we look at where do we compete in categories that are fundamentally healthy and growing and within those categories, do we have brands that are proven and strong competitors? If you'll see those markers, those are obviously places, especially assuming if you've got a good margin structure, where you're going to get a good return on A&P investment, so those become priorities in terms of renovating the brand, innovating the brand and supporting the brand. In other cases, we find we've got categories where perhaps the format has changed and it has shifted, but we still have perhaps the leading trademark with respect to the product, but we haven't moved into adjacencies or updated formats with the category. That's a simple innovation opportunity that is existing because, frankly, we're just not minding the shop.","There are other businesses where we have historically invested in innovation and growth, but that shouldn't be the role of those businesses. Those businesses are major cash contributors. They are in mature categories. They have excellent margin and cash flow and we need to manage them for that because if we do that, that will provide fuel to really unlock all of the potential in the higher-growth categories. And then as we'll look at the portfolio, there may be one or two things we say, gee, we don't necessarily love the category. We don't necessarily have the answer in terms of what to do with these businesses. Maybe it's more valuable to somebody else than it is to us and if we find those, we've got this capital loss carryforward that's an asset that we've got here for roughly the next five years.","So it will be a holistic approach to improving the businesses we have, optimizing the mix within our portfolio and also, if we see something on the outside that would be complementary to our portfolio, enable us to refresh our portfolio, especially in the areas of premium, gourmet organic, natural, that could be a good enhancement and addition to our portfolio. We did Blake's last year. That was a small one, but it's the right kind of stuff to really round out our portfolio and capitalize on our manufacturing assets and capabilities.","John Gehring","And on the businesses we sold, we're not in position today to disclose the EBIT on those businesses. What I would say is your sales are right. $470 million will come out on an annualized basis roughly. The proceeds were $480 million and I would tell you that the divestitures will be very modestly dilutive.","Operator","Deutsche Bank's Mario Contreras has our next question.","Mario Contreras","I just wanted to focus in on the Banquet brand. So for the last couple of quarters, that's obviously been a volume headwind, although it sounds like it's been relatively in line with your expectations. Has there been any sequential improvement this quarter versus what you saw last quarter? Are consumers getting any more used to the change in the promoted price point strategy? And then on top of that, I think in conjunction with this activity, there's been some price increases related to quality changes, so is there any way to parse out what the response has been to those actions in particular? And then just building on top of that, if there's any learnings you can take from that and apply to other brands that may be undergoing this type of strategy going forward?","Tom McGough","This is Tom McGough. In terms of Banquet, it's been a very consistent and reliable contributor to profits over time and what we've done is we've looked at ways to invest to sustain that. And there are two things going on. As you mentioned, we took an everyday price increase getting off a decades-long price point of $1 and at the same time, we've eliminated discounts that took that price well below $1 at times. We're essentially just a couple quarters into the migration. I think it's important to highlight is that we made product quality improvements in conjunction with the pricing.","What we're seeing from a consumer standpoint is that there are certainly households that bought Banquet because of the tremendous price value. We anticipated that we would lose some of those households. What we're beginning to see in the data is that the product quality upgrades are beginning to improve our repeat. So over time, we're going to see a business that our repeat purchase rate, our purchase frequency builds. But we're starting from a base of decades of $1 pricing and it is going to take several -- it will take time for us to rebuild business. What we do know is that we've significantly improved the margins of the business that have allowed us to invest.","Operator","We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask about the innovation priorities? You've talked about increasing advertising spending and I'd love to hear maybe a little bit more about the advertising outlook, but in order to effectively advertise, obviously, innovation is the set of product messages you need to put out there. You mentioned product upgrades just now. Are there any specific additional factors or priorities within the innovation pipeline that you're focused on at the moment? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Sean Connolly","Yes, innovation, obviously, is going to be a centerpiece of what our new Growth Center of Excellence is focused on and partnering with Tom's Team on and as you think about ConAgra with respect to innovation, I think you should anticipate that we will run the gamut from necessary renovation and even some of the stuff we've done this past year where we've updated the package designs for the first time literally since the 80s. That's basic renovation stuff. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it is critically important to present our brands in a way that they look like they're from the modern era, but then we're also working on bolder innovations. As an example, last year we conducted a test market of a new product called Wicked Kitchen in the Southeast and we learned a tremendous amount and there were some really exciting things there. ","So the Innovation Team is working on refreshing Wicked Kitchen and we'll show the market what that's going to look like when we do our Investor Day along with some other things. In terms of the kinds of benefits that you should anticipate we'll bring, well, it will be across the board and it will be in line with consumer trends, whether it's global flavor adventure, convenience, things like that. But in general, where we under index in our portfolio the most is really in, as I've talked about, the premium gourmet and then the natural organic and by not really tapping into those consumers, we're missing incremental sales and profit opportunities. Number one, they tend to be higher dollar range. Number two, they are totally incremental to a lot of the businesses we already have in terms of benefit.","And number three, in most cases, we use our existing asset base, so it's very economically efficient. So we've got a full suite of things and we'll share a lot of this with you in the months and quarters ahead. One of the reasons we've been incredibly focused and aggressive on cost is because, frankly, it takes longer to rebuild your insight pipeline and rebuild your innovation pipeline. So we've jumped all over cost. ","We moved aggressively knowing that it takes some time to get the branded side of the innovation pipeline rebuilt. But that work has been behind the scenes, aggressively under way and we've got some really exciting stuff coming. You saw some of it, early stuff, this past year with things like Healthy Choice Simply which is a clean label line there that's done really well for us and some other things, but that's just the beginning; there's plenty more to come.","Operator","We'll move to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","A question for Tom and Sean on the $100-million savings for trade promotion, I've talked to a lot of companies that are focusing on the same kind of effort and a lot of them have been a little bit concerned about making that dollar value target so public as you have. And Sean, I remember you did that with Hillshire as well.","And I was wondering, in your relationships with retailers, has there been any negative pushback on the $100 million just in terms of people getting the wrong idea, feeling like the money is coming out of their pocket or have they at all said what's our cut of savings that you're going to be generating? How do we benefit from it? Wondering what you thought.","Sean Connolly","Rob, that's an excellent question and it's a very important question. I think I may have talked about this at CAGNY. When you talk about trade efficiency with customers -- I may have mentioned this on the last call and I think I used the phrase you have to have a good bedside manner because you have to be very explicit around what we're talking about and what we're not talking about. When you walk into a buyer's desk and you say, I'm ripping out trade and taking it to my bottom line, as you might imagine, that is not the most desirable bedside manner and it doesn't go really well and that is not the conversation we're having.","It is we can think of it in terms of $100 million in EBIT improvement and certainly, there may be some trade deals that are just so stupid and in efficient, we just eliminate them lock, stock and barrel. However, in other cases, because of the advanced analytics we're investing in, what we're doing with most of our customers is saying look, here are some case studies of where we spend chunks of money with you. Let's look at the empirical evidence together. It's clearly generating a nonexistent or anemic return.","Alternatively, here is some things we can do that can generate a positive return and drive your top line and drive your bottom line. And when we're database and can bring in the evidence around the deals that aren't working and also the evidence of the deals that are working and say we're doing less of the former and more of the latter, we find we have a very engaged customer, because at the end of the day, as tough as growth has been in this industry for manufacturers, it's been the same way for retailers. Everybody is looking for profitable growth. And if we can bring intellectual capital to the table that can help not only our situation but our customers' P&L, that's a conversation that's well received.","Johan Nystedt","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today will come from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","I just have two quick ones for you. The first one will just be -- and I know there's been a general discussion about the gross margin, but it was weaker than I expected in the quarter. And as I think about supply chain savings and favorable input costs, I was surprised by the softer performance. And what I'm getting, at as I look ahead, there's a couple million dollars of cost savings coming through, but they're mostly SG&A focused.","So I wanted to get a sense of the gross margin improvement, say, from like the average level over the past few quarters. Should we expect that to improve in FY '17? And then to the degree that's a fuel for reinvestment, I know you don't want to get into phasing of savings here, but just the degree to which -- like marketing should start accelerating early in FY '17 or is that likely to happen later in the year? Just trying to get a sense of when and where you'll invest.","Tom McGough","Chris, in terms of margins, as I highlighted a little bit earlier, it's a multi-dimensional approach, revenue, gross management that we talked extensively about today, the mix management, also supply chain productivity network optimization. What you're going to see over time is a gradual and consistent increase of our margin that will allow us to continue to invest in our brands. That's our overall approach. I think there's a long runway of opportunity. We certainly talked about the $100 million in terms of the revenue growth piece in terms of trade.","We have a very consistent history of supply chain productivity and we're adding additional programs and initiatives to bolster our capabilities. In terms of A&P, as Sean said, we take a very disciplined and strategic approach with an ROI to investment. I don't think we have a targeted level of A&P in general for the portfolio. It's brand by brand and you can see where we've made those investments and the market impact that's having. That's what I think you can expect going forward is a zero-based approach where A&P is not an entitlement; it's earned. And we're strengthening our portfolio in a way that allows us to invest in more brands.","Sean Connolly","All right, operator. I think that will do it.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Johan Nystedt","Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be available and archived on the web as detailed in our news release. We're available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.","Operator","This concludes today's ConAgra Foods fourth quarter earnings conference call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, ConAgra\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. ","Brian Kearney","Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Brian Kearney, ConAgra\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Johan Nystedt has taken on a new and very important role as the Chief Risk Officer, while also keeping his existing Treasurer role. In order to focus on his role of evaluating and managing enterprise wide risk, Johan will be transitioning his Investor Relations duties to me. I thank Johan for his leadership, as we have transitioned from ConAgra Foods to ConAgra Brands.","That said, during today\u2019s remarks, we will making some forward-looking statement, and while we're making these statements in good faith and are confident in our company's directions, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve.","So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, we'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either their earnings press release, or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found on our website at conagrabrands.com\/investor-relations.","Now, I'll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Remarkably, it was almost two years ago to the day that I hosted my first call as ConAgra\u2019s CEO. As you may recall, the company had its hands full at the time and I shared my initial assessment of what we needed to do. I told you that I saw a tremendous opportunity at the company, but that unlocking it meant we had to move quickly and take bold actions on a number of fronts.","Well today, two years later, I think it\u2019s clear this is a new era and we are a new company. Yes, ConAgra is about 100 years old, but for the first time in our history we are a focused pure play branded CPG Company. Becoming a pure play has enabled us to sharpen our focus on the critical elements necessary to improve performance. We\u2019ve moved from an emphasis on unit volume to a focus on value and from a reliance on trade discounting to a strategy based on renewed brand relevancy. We\u2019ve moved from a tendency towards SKU proliferation to being clear-eyed about SKU optimization.","Our A&P support and innovation programs are far more disciplined. We have aggressively addressed our cost structure and we\u2019ve become leaner and as you\u2019ve seen our margins are far stronger. Overall, by relentlessly following the portfolio management principles we shared at our Investor Day, we\u2019ve clearly positioned the company for better long term value creation. ","In deed we\u2019ve moved quickly and taken aggressive action over the past two years. We\u2019ve reshaped our company and our portfolio, exiting private brands, as well as non-core businesses like Spicetec and JM Swank. Soon we expect to add Wesson to that list. We flawlessly executed the Lamb Weston spin, we've also added on trend brands through modernizing acquisitions like Blake's, Frontera, Duke's and BIGS.","At the same time, we\u2019ve overhauled our culture, growth capabilities and margins behind a new management team and an energized new corporate headquarters. This went hand-in-hand with aggressive actions to reduce costs, upgrade the quality of our revenue base, and jumpstart innovation across the company. Clearly, we\u2019ve been busy, but our work is not finished.","As I told you two years ago, we are committed to moving with agility, but transforming ConAgra is a multi-year effort, not a flip of the switch. At our inaugural ConAgra Brands Investor Day, I described the cadence of our work this way. As we have just discussed, for the last two fiscal years we focused on resetting our top line and cost structure. Now that we\u2019ve undone some legacy practices that inflated our volume base and have rebuilt our innovation capabilities we are positioned to improve growth trend sequentially.","In fiscal 2018, we will continue our progress to bend the top line trend. We expect to further accelerate growth in the future as our innovation pipeline and new marketing programs take hold in the marketplace. Meanwhile, margin expansion has been and always will be a way of life at ConAgra Brands and I\u2019ll recap our progress here in a minute. But while we\u2019ve made tremendous progress, our work is not done. ","We still have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to chip away at our margin opportunities and strengthen our innovation programs in order to improve our growth prospects. Of course, we will also continue to reshape our portfolio, not just by strengthening the brands we own, but by bringing in new assets and potentially divesting assets that no longer fit as we are in the process of doing with Wesson.","Now turning to our performance summary on Slide 10. We concluded our second full year of transformation with solid results that were in line with our expectations for both the fourth quarter and the full-year. Excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange, net sales for the quarter were down 3.6%, reflecting continued improvement in topline trends as we upgrade the quality of our volume base.","The volume declines associated with our rebase abated sequentially this year as expected. For fiscal year 2017, comparable net sales were down 5%. Adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points to 29% in the quarter, driven by supply chain realized productivity, improved pricing and the benefit of having divested lower margin businesses.","For fiscal 2017, adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 30.2%. It is worth noting that we estimate that Spicetec and JM Swank, which we divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, reduced the adjusted gross margin by approximately 20 basis points in the year. In terms of our bottom line, adjusted diluted EPS of $0.37 for the quarter was up nearly 16% from the prior year. For fiscal 2017, adjusted dilutive EPS increased 34% to $1.74.","Our fiscal 2017 story was one of margin improvement and Slide 11 highlights the strong progress we continue to make. In addition to the gross margin improvement I touched on a moment ago, on the right side of the slide, you can see we also drove 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement, compared to Q4 of last year, and 310 basis points year-over-year.","As our margin improvement demonstrates, our SG&A, cost reduction, and trade efficiency programs are squarely on track. We have changed our promotional practices to adjust pricing, while investing in improved quality, updated packaging, and higher ROI A&P support. We\u2019ve also been disciplined in examining the value every SKU delivers to our brands, so that we can eliminate laggards and remove unnecessary complexity and cost. And the value of our supply chain productivity programs is clearly coming through.","Finally, the divestiture of lower margin businesses also contributed to improving our gross margin profile. Overall, our actions have led to stronger and more consistent bottom line performance and we remain focused on continuing to drive the center line of our profitability north over time. Clearly, there will be some standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we are taking the long view.","Looking ahead, we see no major structural issues that would prevent us from delivering our long term targets, as we continue to chip away at our margin opportunity. While we\u2019ve been relentless on cost reduction and improving efficiencies in order to build a strong foundation on the bottom line, we know we can't cut our way to prosperity, we've got to grow, but we\u2019ve got to do it the right way, which is all about profitable volume growth and a more modern -looking portfolio.","As we highlighted in the past, the left chart on Slide 13 demonstrates the impact of our efforts to drive out lower ROI incremental sales. Incremental volume sales have declined, as we anticipated, which is squarely on track with our strategy. The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends demonstrating that our efforts to build a stronger foundation are working. Simply put, our brands, while leaner are presenting better and therefore turning better in a non-promoted context.","Overall, our disciplined approach to resetting the top line is continuing to bend the trend. As you can see by the sequential improvement shown on Slide 14, we remain focused on execution and continual progress. Fiscal 2017 was a heavy lift as we've put in the work to thoughtfully and methodically upgrade our revenue base. ","As we enter fiscal 2018, we are working from a much stronger base. There is a healthier business emerging, one that is less promotional with a greater percentage of volume coming from loyal households and at a higher margin. This allows us to invest in renovation and innovation and ultimately leads to sustainable growth.","A great example of how we are leveraging innovation and renovation to modernize brands is our work on healthy choice. As you will recall from Investor Day, we have segmented our portfolio into four distinct quadrants each with unique opportunities and challenges. Healthy choice falls in our reinvigorate growth quadrant. Our former CEO, Mike Harper conceived of Healthy Choice in the 1980s when he was seeking healthier alternatives following a heart attack.","Initially Healthy Choice offered meals with lower sodium, fat, and cholesterol for heart health. Healthy Choice still does that job well today, but consumer perceptions of health and wellness have evolved to more than just heart health. Today, consumers are looking for ingredients they can pronounce, natural sources of protein, and meals that are easy to prepare. ","We saw an opportunity to innovate and differentiate the Healthy Choice brand to respond to these consumer needs by entering premium segments adding modern product attributes, upgrading product quality, and developing contemporary, ethnic cuisines. Leading this transformation has been the Healthy Choice cafe steamers platform, which today makes up over 80% of the brand's net sales.","Cafe steamers deliver higher quality modern product attributes in a patented tray in tray package. When you prepare these meals in the microwave, the sauce actually steams the ingredient, which unlocks the flavors, textures, and colors of our restaurant inspired recipes. The launch of simply steamers in 2015 further elevated the brand offering 100% natural proteins and nothing artificial.","Some of our simply steamers are made with organic ingredients and offer new bold emerging international flavors and recipes. The Healthy Choice transformation demonstrates that a legacy brand can attract younger households. In just the last 26 weeks of fiscal 2017, brand volume from millennials is up 17%. IRI total dollars sales are up 2.2%, despite a 21% reduction in incremental sales, which is consistent with our focus on value over volume.","Base dollars sales are even stronger, up 9% over the latest 26 weeks, and 12% over the latest 13 weeks with base velocities up 11% and up 4% over the latest 26 and latest 13 weeks respectively. And perhaps my favorite part of this case study is the margin story. Overall, our Healthy Choice frozen business has grown margins by more than 900 basis points since fiscal 2014 as we began to price the value and removed unprofitable promotions. And there is even more opportunity on Healthy Choice.","We are taking the next step in migrating this brand up-market through the introduction of our new Power Bowls line. Power Bowls reflect our food philosophy that every ingredient matters. Every Power Bowel is a nutrient dense composition of purposeful ingredients like whole grains, greens, lean protein, fruits and vegetables served in a plant-based Fiber Bowl available in four bowl new flavors, adobo chicken, Korean beef, chicken sausage and barley and Cuban pork, customers have responded very positively to this new lineup since the national launch on June 1.","While still early day\u2019s Power Bowls are on track to reach a very healthy ACV by the end of calendar year 2017. Healthy Choice is a terrific proxy for how we plan to reinvigorate even more of our brands. On Slide 18, you see a snapshot of the exciting slate of innovative products across our portfolio that will be hitting the shelves this year. Obviously, our industry is hungry for improved growth. That\u2019s not up for debate, but what I do here being debated is what exactly is going to drive that growth with some of the more recent speculation pointing to discount pricing.","We believe the answer to this question goes well beyond low prices, in fact our analysis shows that the relationship in our categories between discount pricing and branded sales trends is not one size fits all. To the contrary, in many categories the better branded performers are often more premium priced products that have been innovated to build in modern food attributes like clean label, natural ingredients, and ethnic flavors. My main points here are that we believe the key to spurring growth is innovation such as what you see on this page. Also, that the consumers calculus on what drives value is much more comprehensive than price alone.","Now turning to Slide 19, as we move into fiscal 2018 and beyond, the portfolio management principles we outlined at our Investor Day will continue to guide our actions. As we discussed earlier, we\u2019ve done a lot of heavy lifting to rebase our revenue, which sets a stronger foundation for continued improvement in our top line trends.","Our innovation progress is clearly accelerating and we expect new products to continue to hit the market throughout fiscal 2018. Execution excellence remains a focus in everything we do, and we will continue to chip away at the margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.","Finally, we expect to find additional opportunities to reshape our portfolio. Clearly this includes continuing to enhance our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A, but it may also include exiting brands that no longer fit and are more highly valued by others in an efficient manner and leveraging our tax asset. We still have work to do, but we are on track as we execute against our plan.","We are confident in the strategy we have in motion is the right one to sustain improved consistency in our performance and profitability, while delivering long-term shareholder value. Slide 20 outlines our fiscal 2018 outlook, which Dave will discuss in further detail in a few minutes, but at a high level you can see that for fiscal 2018, the first full year included in the long-term algorithm we outlined at Investor Day, we are projecting organic net sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange to be down 2% to flat.","We anticipate that the organic sales improvement we expect to see in the grocery and snacks and refrigerated and frozen segments could be offset by the introduction of our value over volume strategy in our international and food service businesses in fiscal 2018. I also want to highlight that we expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to come in at $1.84 to $1.89.","Finally, with improved profitability and a strong cash flow, we anticipate repurchasing $1.1 billion of shares in fiscal 2018. Again, it won't be a straight line, but we remain committed to a long-term growth algorithm. As a reminder, this algorithm excludes any assumptions about M&A activity. Clearly, this doesn't mean M&A isn\u2019t part of our strategy, it just means that we didn't include any related assumptions into our outlook.","Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented and dedicated ConAgra Brands employees who in fiscal 2017 continue to embrace change and continue to execute our strategy, while doing a tremendous job of serving our customers. With that, over to you Dave.","Dave Marberger","Thank you Sean and good morning everyone. Before I start, I want to review a few points on our basis of presentation and the related joint ventures have been reclassified as discontinued operations since the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The commercial reporting segment has no current operating results. Since the second quarter, it has only included the historical results with the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which we divested in the first quarter. ","References to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. These items are reconciled to the closest GAAP measures in tables that are included in the earnings release and presentation deck. Moving on to our results, as you can see on Slide 22, we continue to make strong progress improving our financial profile as we reshape our portfolio.","Reported net sales for the fourth quarter were down 9.3%, and net sales excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange were down 3.6%, reflecting sequential improvement against our first half and third quarter net sales growth rates. For the full-year, net sales excluding the impact of divestitures and foreign exchange were down 5% in-line with our estimates. ","Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 5.1% for the fourth quarter. The sale of Spicetec and Swank drove 3 percentage points of this decline. The remaining decline was from lower volume and unfavorable FX, partially offset by the gross margin rate improvement. Adjusted gross margin was 29% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 130 basis points. Approximately 70 basis points of improvement came from divesting the lower margin Spicetec and Swank businesses. ","The remaining increase came from supply chain realized productivity gains and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency, the benefits of which were more than offset by the negative impacts of increased inflation. For the full-year, adjusted gross margin was 30.2%, an increase of 180 basis points. Inclusion of the lower margins Spicetec and Swank businesses for the first quarter 2017 negatively impacted full-year adjusted gross margin by 20 basis points.","Sean discussed the fiscal 2017 key margin drivers supporting our 180 basis point improvement in gross margin noting trade promotion efficiency and pricing SKU rationalization, supply chain realized productivity offsetting inflation, and divesting lower margin businesses, partially offset by unfavorable FX.","Moving on, adjusted operating profit was down 2.3% for the fourth quarter. Strong SG&A performance, which I will discuss in more detail shortly, was not enough to fully offset 4 percentage points of decline related to the Spicetec and Swank divestitures. Adjusted operating profit for the full-year was up 12.4%, which includes 4.4 percentage points of decline from the divestitures.","Importantly, adjusted operating margin continued its strong improvement versus the prior year and exceeded our estimates for the year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 13.6%, up 100 basis points. Full-year adjusted operating margin was 15.8%, up 310 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, up 15.6%. Fourth quarter EPS benefited from significant SG&A reductions, lower interest expense, favorable performance in Ardent Mills and increased share repurchase, partially offset by lower profit from volume declines and the divestitures.","For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $1.74, up 33.8%. This was above our original EPS guidance and the increase was driven by the same factors just mentioned for the fourth quarter. I will discuss full-year EPS in more detail shortly. Slide 23 shows the drivers of our fourth quarter and full-year net sales change versus last year.","Net sales, excluding divestitures and FX were down 3.6% for the fourth quarter and were down 5% for the year. Both the fourth quarter and full year of net sales performance were driven by volume declines, partially offset by improvements in price mix in line with our value over volume strategy. ","The acquisition of the Duke's and BIGS brands in the fourth quarter added about 40 basis points to the Q4 growth rate and 10 basis points to the full-year growth rate. The fourth quarter net sales performance shows continued improvement in the rate of growth versus the first half and third quarter of 2017. Our planned strategic approach to bending the sales trend is working. Our new culture of lean is also yielding benefits.","Slide 24 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was $211 million in the fourth quarter, down 12.7% versus a year ago. Adjusted SG&A for the full-year was $803 million, down 21% or $214 million, exceeding our $200 million SG&A reduction commitment.","We finished 2017 with an SG&A rate of 10.3% of net sales, which is among the most efficient SG&A rates in the industry. We are pleased with the great progress we have made and about the continuous improvement mindset that has taken hold across all areas of our company. Efficiency is not a program at ConAgra; it is part of the culture.","Slide 25 summarizes A&P spending for the fourth quarter and full year. A&P spending was up 11.8% for the fourth quarter versus the prior year as we increased our investment spending to support brand saliency in advance of the new product initiatives Sean discussed. For the full-year 2017, A&P spending as a percentage of net sales was 4.2%, up from 4% in 2016. Although we significantly improved our margins in EPS performance in 2017, this did not come at the expense of brand investment.","Slide 26 highlights our net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. Overall, the value over volume strategy executed in 2017 delivered largely as expected. We experienced volume declines across the portfolio as planned, but every segment delivered solid margin improvement during the year. Our portfolio is now better positioned as we move into fiscal 2018.","In our grocery and snack segment net sales were $3.2 billion for the year, down 5%. 5.3% decline in volume, and 50 basis points of negative mix were partially offset by 80 basis points of favorable price and trade productivity. Adjusted operating profit was $779 million for the year, an increase of 12.1%; and adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, an increase of 370 basis points. This segments increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross profit expansion and reduced SG&A costs, despite lower sales volume.","In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $2.7 billion for fiscal year 2017, down 7.5%. An 8.6% decline in volume was partially offset by favorable price mix of 110 basis points. Adjusted operating profit was $452 million for the year, up 2.4%. Adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2017 was 17%, up 165 basis points. The adjusted operating profit performance reflects gross margin expansion from net pricing and trade efficiency, supply chain realized productivity gains, and SG&A savings, partially offset by volume declines.","As a reminder, adjusted operating profit in this segment benefited in 2016 as our egg beater product supply was not impacted by the Avian flu issue, creating a sales opportunity in 2016. Wrapping this dynamic in 2017 negatively impacted the change in adjusted operating profit by approximately 5 percentage points.","In our international segment, net sales were approximately $800 million for 2017, down 3.6%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume and 3.5% negative impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by 2.4 percentage point improvement in price mix as the international team begins to focus on value over volume.","Adjusted operating profit was $68 million in 2017, flat to prior to year. And adjusted operating margin was 8.3%, up 30 basis points. The operating profit improvement was driven by favorable pricing and lower SG&A expenses offsetting the negative impacts of volume declines and FX.","In our foodservice segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion for the year, down 2.4% as we applied our value over volume principles and exited a non-core food service snack business. Adjusted operating profit was $107 million for fiscal 2017, a 9.3% increase. Adjusted operating margin was 9.9% for 2017, an increase of 105 basis points. Adjusted operating profit increased due to favorable SG&A expense, and adjusted operating margins improved due to existing the low margin business.","As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the commercial segment for the second quarter onward given the Spicetec and JM Swank divestitures in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted corporate expenses were $177 million for 2017, down 29%, reflecting the benefits of our SG&A cost savings efforts. The ConAgra Brands operating segment finished fiscal 2017 as a much stronger profitable portfolio of businesses with a robust innovation pipeline for fiscal 2018 and beyond.","Moving to Slide 27 this chart outlines the drivers of adjusted diluted EPS improvement from $1.30 in 2016 to $1.74 in 2017, a 33.8% increase. As we expected, the full-year EPS impact of the 6% volume decline was mostly offset by the adjusted gross margin rate improvement of 180 basis points.","We attained approximately 50 basis points of improvement for the year by divesting the lower margin Spicetec and JM Swank businesses in the quarter first quarter. The remaining gross margin improvement came from supply chain realized productivity gains and pricing and trade productivity, partially offset by inflation, unfavorable margin mix, and unfavorable FX.","As I just discussed, we exceeded the $200 million SG&A reduction target, which delivered $0.29 of EPS growth in 2017. EPS improvement was also driven by $2.5 billion debt reduction during 2017 resulting in $100 million of reduced interest expense. EPS also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as we repurchased approximately 25 million shares during 2017. ","The adjusted effective tax rate for 2017 was 31.8%. This rate was favorable to our estimates, due to tax benefits generated upon the exercise of employee stock compensation awards. The sale of Spicetec and JM Swank reduced EPS by approximately $0.06 for the year. Slide 28 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for 2017 versus 2016.","Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was $1.1 billion for full-year 2017 versus $626 million for the same period a year ago, an increase of 82%. This significant increase was driven by higher income from operations, lower interest expense, and a reduction in the company's restructuring and tax payments, partially offset by a $150 million pension contribution made in the fourth quarter.","The cash flow improvement was also driven by very strong working capital improvement in the areas of inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Our team places a strong focus on managing working capital as a source of cash, and total trade working capital declined $263 million or 27% in fiscal year 2017. This reflects a reduction in cash conversion of approximately 12 days in fiscal 2017, truly outstanding performance.","We had capital expenditures of $242 million for 2017, versus $278 million in 2016. We are in-line with our targets for capital spending of 3% to 4% of net sales. We pay dividends of $450 million in 2017, down slightly from 2016, due to the impact of the Lamb Weston spinoff.","During 2017, we repurchased approximately $25 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $1 billion. As disclosed in our earnings release, the board has authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases giving us a total authorization as of today of approximately $1.3 billion. We ended fiscal 2017 with $3 billion of total debt and approximately $250 million of cash on hand. This results in net debt of approximately $2.7 billion as of year-end, down from $4.6 billion in net debt at year-end 2016.","As we have stated, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating for the business. I would also like to note the following items. Equity method investment earnings were $71 million for 2017, up $5 million versus the prior year, due to the improved performance by Ardent Mills. For 2017, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $29 million versus the prior year, and negatively impacted operating profit by $10 million.","In late May, we announce the sale of Wesson oil business. Upon the expected completion of this transaction, we will have used approximately 38% of our tax capital loss carryforward. Our fourth quarter comparability items are detailed in the earnings release. Among our fourth quarter comparability items is a $0.21 of EPS benefit, due to our expected sale of Wesson and utilization of the tax loss carryforward.","We will provide more information on the Wesson transaction after it closes. The remaining items affecting EPS comparability for the fourth quarter, which we exclude from our adjusted financial measures are as follows: $0.02 per diluted share of net expenses related to restructuring plans, $0.05 per diluted share of net expense related to an impairment charge for the Wesson oil production facility that is not expected to be included in the sale, $0.16 per diluted share of net expense related to goodwill and tangible asset impairment charges related to our Chef Boyardee brand and to a lesser extent our Canadian and Mexican businesses, and lastly, offsetting $0.01 per diluted share items, a $0.01 benefit from a legal settlement, and $0.01 expense related to hedging derivative losses.","On Slide 29, we summarize our fiscal 2018 financial outlook and reiterate our three-year fiscal 2020 financial algorithm, which uses fiscal year 2017\u2019s final results as the base year. Our fiscal 2018 financial outlook supports our three-year financial algorithm. We expect reported net sales growth to be down 2% to flat showing improvement to the rate of our 2017 net sales decline.","We expect fiscal year 2018 organic net sales growth to also be down 2% to flat. Organic net sales growth excludes the impacts of FX and acquisitions and divestitures until the anniversary day of the transactions. Our three-year fiscal 2020 outlook expects a net sales CAGR of plus 1% to 2%. The fiscal year 2018 outlook moves the company closer to the three-year sales growth CAGR.","We expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.9% to 16.3% for fiscal 2018 as we continue to strengthen our portfolio and invest in product innovation. Our three year fiscal 2020 outlook expects adjusted operating margin of 16.5% in fiscal year 2020. We expect the effective tax rate to be 32.5 to 33.5% in fiscal 2018, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.84 to $1.89.","We expect to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion of shares in fiscal 2018 subject to market and other conditions. The fiscal 2020 algorithm expects an EPS CAGR of plus 10%. We establish this CAGR when the fiscal 2017 EPS outlook had $1.70 at the high end of the range. Even factoring in our EPS overdelivery of $1.74 in 2017, the 2018 EPS guidance moves the company towards the three year EPS CAGR outlook. We expect to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 45% to 50% in each year through fiscal year 2020.","Our 2018 outlook includes the estimated financial results of the Wesson business, since the sale was still pending. We will update our 2018 guidance when the transaction closes. I also want to comment on the quarterly flow of the 2018 outlook. We expect net sales and EPS performance for fiscal 2018 to be weighted towards the second half of the fiscal year. We expect net sales growth to improve each quarter as new products build distribution with customers and trial with consumers. Also, cost savings from realized productivity is weighted towards the second half, due to the timing of projects.","In summary, ConAgra Brands continues to make excellent progress executing its strategic plan as evidenced by the strong fiscal year 2017 financial results. We have made great progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins and operating margins are expanding and our $200 million SG&A cost reduction program has over delivered. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate acquisition opportunities to drive shareowner value.","And our fiscal year 2020 financial outlook continues to support margin and earnings growth over the next three years, resulting in strong total shareowner returns over that time. Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough, and I will be happy to take your questions.","I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Q - Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Andrew","Dave Marberger","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","As I recall, I think back at your Investor Day, I think it was Supply Chain Head, Dave Biegger, he had mentioned that M&A as potentially an incremental benefit in terms of a much more significant I guess supply chain unlock, and therefore the potential for additional margin opportunity, and I guess volumes in the industry as a whole in ConAgra maybe taking a bit more time to come around. I guess for ConAgra, does larger M&A became more of a necessity to sort of hit your current margin goals given negative fixed cost leverage and such?","Sean Connolly","Yes, Andrew our long-term algorithm does not make an assumption in terms of any kind of scale deals, so the long-term numbers that we reaffirm today are basically us running our base play. The point Dave was making at our Investor Day is that we have our top notch supply chain team that has been extremely active in the industry reducing the number of plants by 30% in the past six years or so, achieving realized productivity of 2.8% on average year-in your-out, which translates if you use to the measure of gross productivity through significantly higher number, as well as base plans to further increase realized productivity 15% and 20% by 2020, as well as commenting to get $400 million of working capital.","So all of those things are assumed in our long term algorithm and get us to our long-term algorithm. The point he was making on M&A is to the degree we all have conversations about bigger transformations within our supply chain. There are other concepts out there and that last slide that shared in that presentation - that are really conceptual in nature, which are things like joint ventures, consolidation of supply chain networks, and things like that. Those concepts always offer incremental opportunity, but what Dave was pointing out, those are things that we are always open to and we will always contemplate, but they are not assumed as required in order for us to get to our long-term algorithm.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Thanks for that, and then when do you anticipate that the change or decline that we have seen in distribution points should trough, I guess such that the velocity improvements that you site in the slides can start to really show through in terms of volume growth, because I think you did expand the work you\u2019ve done.","Sean Connolly","Yes, you have seen this year, it has been a fundamental reset of top line and a big part of that and it varies by business, bank was a good example of where we have done a lot of SKU rationalization including in this past quarter in Q4, but you have seen trends abate there. So, as we start to wrap those you're going to see those change and obviously we are quite pleased and excited about our top line prospects this year calling for a minus 2 to flat, which is a trend bend on our topline of 300 basis points to 500 basis points, which is probably some of the stronger bend in the industry.","And that obviously reflects wrapping this - the heavy lifting we have done this past year, but also the confidence we have in our innovation programs, and our plans to rebuild TPDs, total points of distribution in higher quality read this year. So you will see that and I think as you think about our topline you should think about it as just like you\u2019ve seen recently building momentum as we proceed through front half to back half quarter-to-quarter so to speak.","Operator","The next question will come from David Driscoll of Citi Research. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hi, David. ","Dave Marberger","Good morning","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask a few things here about new products, in your Investor Day you laid out the 2020 goal of 15% of net sales to come from new products, can you talk about this slate of F-18 new products, how it fits into that goal, how impactful you think these new products can be? And then can you share just what is the philosophy on the gross margin impact from new products? Do you have, kind of mandatory rules that the teams have to live by on the gross margin benefits or accretion that comes from new products?","Sean Connolly","Yes absolutely. Let me hit those David. First of all the metrics David, we call it in renewal rate, which is percent of annual net sales that come from prior three-year innovations and historically we were I think in the high-single digits range. Our goal is to get that to about 15%, not in a low quality way because we\u2019ve got experience with SKU proliferation in the past, but in a higher quality way and we're making good progress this year just with the innovations like you have seen, but keep in mind when it comes to innovation we effectively, not only did we rebase our topline this past year, we basically pushed pause on all innovation, so we could rebuild the pipe in a higher quality way, which is the stuff you see launching this year.","So we will get better at that as we go and we will do it informed by our portfolio segmentation and our improved insights and analytics capabilities, but when we do evaluate future innovations, we do challenge our teams to always pursue margin accretive innovation. Now sometimes in the early days of an innovation you will see a little bit of a lower gross margin, if we choose for example to go to a co-packer because in those cases, we want to prove out our thinking before we invest our own capital or if we buy a higher growth business that was run by an entrepreneur that has lower gross margins. In their early days, we know once we can get it in our system we can raise those margins over time. We\u2019ve experienced some of that in this past quarter with Thanasi and Frontera as an example, but you can see from our past couple of years of behavior we are somewhat obsessed with the notion of margin expansion around here and certainly margin accretive innovation is part of that game plan.","David Driscoll","And then just one follow-up on cost savings, did you say or can you say, what is the expected savings or the normal productivity savings expected in fiscal 2018?","Sean Connolly","Yes David. We think of that specific level of detail, what I will tell you is that, the productivity programs that we discussed at Investor Day and the 3.3% of realized productivity is on track. What we\u2019re seeing and it was really showed up in our Q4 results a bit, is the increase in inflation. So as you remember we had an assumption of 2.3% of inflation over the three-year horizon for our algorithm, and Q4 our inflation was around 2.7% and right now we are looking at that as more of the run rate for 2018. So on track with productivity, we are continuing to look even harder at opportunities there and pricing opportunities, but we are seeing more inflation, which impacts next year.","Operator","And the next question will be from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thanks very much. Sean you highlighted at the beginning of your talk about margin growth still being a big part of the story, but if you look at the midpoint of your EBITDA margin guidance for 2018 it\u2019s 16.1%, regarding the 16.5% by 2020 that\u2019s only 20 basis points of growth per year over 2019 and 2020, I realized two and this point to Andrew's point volumes aren\u2019t helping right, but it still seems like a fairly low bar for a company that\u2019s early in its transformation, so I guess I\u2019m just curious why is 16.5% not a bit conservative in your long-term outlook?","Sean Connolly","Well we only gave the long term outlook just 6 or 7 months ago at our Investor Day Ken and obviously we have over delivered a little bit on the business since we gave our outlook. So we\u2019re not in a position to change that outlook now, we are reaffirming it, we are - as I pointed out many times, our margin expansion story, we did harvest a lot of the low hanging fruit in the first couple of years, and the language I used to describe where we go from here is that we will continue to keep chipping away at it, and we will do that successfully.","With respect to margins and frankly with respect to our profitability overall, I always make the point that what we focus on is the centerline of our profitability moving North over time. And the reason for that is as you know in any given quarter, in any given year there might be other dynamics that can impact gross margin, in the short-term one way or another. Last thing you want to do when you are leading a transformation like we\u2019re leading is let those short-term dynamics take you off of your strategic game plan.","So in the case of this year we've obviously got significantly more inflation in our outlook than we had last year. That will be a factor, but the good news there is that principally we always plan to price to inflation and we will look to do that again. Dave you want to add something to that?","Dave Marberger","Yes just to build on that, another dynamic Ken is that with SG&A, as I commented. We were improved $214 million for the year, right? So that exceeded our target. Some of that was some one-time benefit and some headcount-related stuff that will come back for next year. So, we accelerated that savings, so some of that savings is going to kind of come back next year in terms of some moderate increases in SG&A. So that\u2019s just the dynamics of the timing between 2017 and going forward.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. And then from my follow-up, you were just talking about passing on some inflation. General Mills said this week that when it comes to taking price it isn't really having many problems that it is the retailers that are investing in price, but certainly taking Mills as increases, but Smucker few weeks ago sort of said the opposite, I\u2019m just curious in your view where does ConAgra currently fall in this spectrum, have you had any more difficulty than usual taking pricing, have any of your major customers been more challenging to negotiate with, just trying to get a general sense of your view of the industry right now?","Sean Connolly","Yes Ken, I think this is a really important point and you heard in my comments earlier that it is obvious that retailers and manufacturers are like - are hungry for improved growth, and we believe that the key to that growth is innovation and we also believe that the consumers calculus on value is a lot more than price alone. And in fact now that we are in an inflationary environment as we thought we would be, we do plan to price inflation as we can and that\u2019s what I expect we will do going forward and as we do that there are really three things I would want you to keep in mind. One is, our customers understand fully what ConAgra is doing in terms of transforming our brands and our portfolio and they are very supportive of our work to upgrade and contemporize these brands and acknowledge that consumers evaluate a lot more than price point in their value calculus.","So our customers are supportive. Frankly, our customers probably historically have compressed their own margins on our businesses too much and they are happy to see our prices and our quality and innovation move north. So that\u2019s a positive and we have, I think as good a customer relationship right now as that\u2019s certainly we have seen since I have been here. The second thing is, as we think about pricing, in every one of our segments we have brands that offer terrific value price points. So, if we have to take price they will still be a terrific value relative to alternatives specifically because of the brand renovation work that we\u2019ve been doing. ","And then the other point is, I think the point I made, which is when the environment shifts from noninflationary inflationary sometimes you see some growth gross margin volatility in the short term and that is why we focus on the centerline not sure term deviation. So, yes I think pricing to inflation will continue to be a central part of our game plan and that\u2019s what we intend to do going forward. In fact, in some of our categories, I think some peanut butter, we\u2019ve already done that here in the recent months.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about how your promotion efficiency and innovation pipelines are different as you head into fiscal 2018 than a year ago? And in particular you talk about the 3 to 5 point improvement in revenue, I am wondering how much of that is roughly bucketed between these different things, including the SKU reductions? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yeah David, I think if you go back a year, maybe two years, three years certainly, we have moved from being one of the most promotional companies in the food industry to now I think we are probably in the bottom two or three. So our promotional intensity has changed dramatically. We still do a lot of promotion, but it is higher quality promotion, we have better systems in place, we track and examine every single event.","Obviously, we are still young at doing that, but we are getting better at that every day, and that is, importantly it is retraining the consumer to buy our products in a non-merchandized condition based on the attractiveness of the benefits they see on the shelf. And that is a critically important notion over time. But certainly that 300 to 500 basis improvement that we are counting on this year is tied heavily to us getting our new innovation into the marketplace.","We will continue to weed out items that are either margin dilutive or don\u2019t help our brands, but we hope to have net gains and that\u2019s what we expect as we launch these new innovations so it will be clearly a net positive. Dave, do you want to add something?","Dave Marberger","Just to add one thing. Our trade productivity target of 100 million in savings through the end of 2017 were about two-thirds of the way through that. So we still expect the benefit as we move forward. We finished fiscal 2017 in the grocery business of about 80 basis points of improvement in pricing, and about 110 basis points of improvement for frozen. So that will still be part of the calculus to grow, but as Sean said, the new products launching and the volume as a big part of it as well.","David Palmer","And just following up on that, when it comes to promotions and the efficiency of them, there is a type of promotion efficiency you can get by having better spend on the dollar. So at some point, particularly as you get your innovation pipeline ramped up are you getting a pipeline and better insights about how you can change the constructs of you promotions such that you can better bank for the buck and better net revenue impact in fiscal 2018?","Sean Connolly","Yes, David that is a center piece of what we are doing and we have invested as we have mentioned before in a number of IT tools, post event analytic tools, trade planning and optimization tools that led us look at all kinds of events by ROI literally at the store level or vent level and it\u2019s in the simplest notion what you do is you identify the inefficient ones, you do fewer of those, you identify the ones that are much more efficient and you do more of those and it is basically a mix concept, it is a mix improvement and it is delivering improved overall effectiveness and efficiency.","Operator","The next question will be from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey guys, thank you for squeezing me in.","Sean Connolly","Hi Jason.","Dave Marberger","Hi Jason.","Jason English","Congrats on a pretty solid year all around, particularly in a tough environment. Looking forward, I think you shared some color, I am afraid I missed some of the details, so I was hoping you could remind me what you said in terms of expectations for growth by segment. I thought I heard you say, international food service you are going to apply your value to volume approach there, so we should expect some weakness, but did you say that grocery and Refrigerated & Frozen could perhaps return to growth this year?","Sean Connolly","Jason you did hear me correctly. While we don\u2019t guide at a segment level, you can gather from my comments that we are expecting meaningful improvement in our US retail businesses overall and that does reflect the upgraded volume base and robust innovation slate. So at a company level though, our sales guidance of minus 2 to flat does imply that 300 to 500 basis point improvement which while a significant trend band is something that we are confident we can deliver and something that we will ride our US Retail Business as hard in order to deliver.","Jason English","Thank you for that clarification. Then one other question on the buy back, first house-keeping, how you do plan to fund it? Anything you can say in terms of cadence of how you expect to stagger at the buy back and then what if anything, does this mean in terms of you ambitions for sizeable M&A if instead you are kind of deploying a lot of capital, a lot more than we expected into share repo this year.","Sean Connolly","I\u2019ll tell you what, Jason let me take the M&A question and then Dave you can comment a little bit on our buyback and cadence and things like that. With respect to M&A, obviously we\u2019ve been very vocal about our belief that acquisitions will contribute be they smaller modernizing deals like Frontera or Duke\u2019s or larger more synergistic deals, and as you know we will approach any deals we look at with strategic and financial discipline.","If something fits strategically it is actionable and offers a compelling return, we will have fire power and organizational capacity to act. So if a larger synergistic opportunity came out we have the ability to push pause on our buyback program and pursue that deal and our conclusion would be that that is a better way to drive value for our shareholders in that hypothetical scenario. Dave, any specifics on the buyback?","Dave Marberger","Yes, as it relates to the buyback, if you go back to Investor Day Jason, I was very clear about, you know this is our target for buyback assuming no synergistic acquisition, so based on our balanced capital allocation approach if we were to enter in to a large synergistic acquisition that assumption could change. So that\u2019s just important to know. In terms of the funding of it, as you saw this year, our cash flow from operations was about $1.1 billion. We anticipate that next year will be in line with that so most of it would be funded from our cash flow operations with a little increase in our debt. So, that\u2019s generally - we don\u2019t comment on the cadence.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. A couple of questions on the modeling, if I could please, The share repurchase of $1.1 billion, let\u2019s say it all got done, what do you think you would do to your net diluted share count, like how much of it is to offset options and some stuff like that? And then if I look at the range of sales guidance, you know negative 2 to 0 and then compare that to the op margin range, is the assumption here that if you were down at negative 2 that your margin would be higher because you would be working towards a specific operating income kind of number, and if so what is that operating income number look like, but by my modeling it kind of implies like of flattish year for operating income for the company? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes, so good question. Obviously, we have given a range here, so there is a lot of different outcomes that we could have, just to start with your share count question, assuming we would do to pull buyback, clearly we would have more share dilution and just what we need for management compensation, so you can make an assumption on that and were the weighted average shares would be. In terms of the mix between EPS growth and where we would be from operating profit, as you look we gave a range on our operating margin for next year. And the reason for that is because when you look at the new products being launched and the investment behind that in terms of A&P, we do intend to increase our A&P and we talked about this at Investor Day kind of given where our A&P is at 4.2%, compared to some of the peer companies there is room to grow there. So, we would anticipate some investment increase in investment there, but we want to reserve the right as the year goes on and we look at the new products and the execution what those opportunities would be. So that is clearly part of the dynamic, which would obviously affect operating profit increased during the year depending on what level we would go with our A&P. From an SG&A perspective, as I mention we expect some moderate increase given the acceleration of benefit this year, but we finished this year of 10.3% and we clearly don't anticipate getting back the 10.8% that we talked about at Investor Day. So that\u2019s the dynamic obviously from a modeling perspective, you get to look at a lot of different scenarios, but generally that\u2019s how we think about it.","Robert Moskow","That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question will be from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had two questions, I could start first with those follow-up just to understand the, you have all the innovation coming in this year, or your incremental innovation coming in, do you still have some of that tale of SKU rationalization that\u2019s occurring as well and, just to sort of understand, is innovation back-half loaded and SKUs - rationalization more front end loaded, just to understand kind of the cadence of how sales growth improves during the year?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I think, while we don't give quarterly guidance clearly we expect the topline that we're going to deliver to build sequentially as we proceed. With respect to kind of the weeding and feeding process as I will call it, we will continue to do SKU rationalization, recall that, the final 20% of our volume historically accounted for the vast majority of our SKUs and we went a long way towards beginning to rationalize some of that last year, but some of that will continue and is certainly continuing now, but we will - we expect to offset that and grow the business through the introduction of the new higher velocity, higher margin items, and those will really flow in as we move through Q1 and in Q2 and build that distribution through the end of the calendar year. So, I can't give you the exact month-to-month kind of net-net in terms of the weeding and feeding Chris, but that\u2019s directionally how to think about it.","Chris Growe","And then maybe quantify that degree of the ongoing sort of SKU rationalization, is that something we should expect going forward, is there larger than usual amount this year?","Sean Connolly","I think we will - as category managers we have always got to do it and you are always going to renovate or at least you should, your brands and your portfolio, so that will be an ongoing peace, but on a going state it is nowhere near the likes of which we have done in this last year, which is really take a significant step forward. It will move into a more normalization rate as we move through this year.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","Okay thank you. Sean this is just a very general question for you, any incremental color just basically on the M&A environment in general, I think would be helpful for everyone. You know it really, I feel like over the past few years we\u2019ve seen descent consolidation obviously within the space, you know over the - I mean, really, year-to-date this year, we're seeing the incremental volume pressure within the industry where a lot of the company is kind of expecting to drive incremental growth through innovation, later in the year. They were hearing all about the pressures and with the retail landscape, we\u2019re seeing some potential increased consolidation on the retail side. So, I was just curious when you speak to your ability, your firepower willingness to do deals, let\u2019s say do you foresee more assets actually coming to market by giving you more options to potentially acquire or at this point, does there seem to be somewhat fine line pipeline?","Sean Connolly","Well it changes every day when you open the newspaper Rob, and certainly if there were an action ability meter out there, the newspaper reporters would have that action, it would make sound like there are more things coming to the market this year than it has been available. My attitude is, I believe it when I see it, but we are always looking and we always cast to widen that and we are very positive about the role that acquisitions can help in our value creation agenda. At the same time, it is our responsibility and shareholders to keep a level head and make sure that what we look at not only fit strategically, but that we are financially disciplined, and we have been, we will continue to be and we will continue to be on the lookout for deals that make good strategic sense and make good financial sense and hopefully there will be some increased action ability moving forward, but we are always ready should that materialize.","Rob Dickerson","Okay great, I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","The next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone and thanks for the question.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. Can I ask about the main drivers of margin expansion this year, it seems like that you have done a lot of heavy lifting on SKU rationalization and so on, so I'm just curious about what are the big levers there and then the follow-up question and I\u2019m not sure you have commented on this yet, but is there likely to be any significant dilutions from the divestments of the Wesson later in the year? Thank you and I will pass it on.","Dave Marberger","Yes Alexia, I will start with the second question first. We are not going to comment at all on any numbers related to Wesson until the deal would actually close. So when that happens we will give more information on that. Regarding your first question, if you look for the year from a gross margin perspective, we were up 180 basis points and that\u2019s just as a reminder coming off at 2016 where we were up 260 basis points. So, we have gone from 26.5% gross margins to 30.2% in two years. When you look at 2017 of the 180 basis points improvement, about 50 basis points of that was related to the divestiture of Spicetec and Swank because that is very low margin mid-teens business.","In addition to that we still are hitting our realized productivity targets that we talked about at Investor Day, so we are getting great productivity from our supply chain. Inflation was relatively benign in the first half of the year, but we have seen it click up particularly in the fourth quarter as I mentioned earlier, around 2.7%, but all in all we\u2019ve still had nice improvement in gross margin for the year despite that headwind.","Operator","The next question will be from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning, thanks so much for the question. I wanted to - I think last week we hit an all-time low for the BB High Yield Index, you made a comment, I think it was Mark, made a comment about - commented on investment grade rating, so question or follow-up I had, sorry, I think it was Dave rather. Too many conference calls. In your record EBITDA interest coverage this quarter and set up for that next quarter, what drives and trading the stock at the minute trading at something like 16 times what you are guiding for 2020 just on that 10% GPS CAGR, what drives that commitment and to the investment grading, what doesn't make this a kind of unprecedented opportunity to take advantage of that with the affordability that kind of low interest rate gives you and maybe event to term out? And as a follow up if the right deal were to materialize, say if one that would give you a number one market share and a category that\u2019s important to you, would you consider being flexible on that or what\u2019s your sense of how high debt-to-EBITDA that this company you can handle in your opinion? Thank you.","Dave Marberger","Yeah, so will take the second question first, we don\u2019t comment on or speculate about M&A, so obviously we evaluated everything as Sean said, we cast a wide net, and then we evaluate everything based on its strategic merit and then all the financial metrics associated with it. To your first question, clearly we are seeing very attractive markets. The cost of borrowing is very low. We believe and remain committed to investment grade, because it really gives us flexibility to borrow, it keeps our borrowing cost even lower and it gives us access to the commercial paper markets, which are very important for us, very low cost of financing and gives us a lot of flexibility. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve committed to and we can continue to make that comment in this environment where we have very low rates all around.","Operator","The next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to follow up on portfolio repositioning and the capital loss carry-forward. I think you mentioned the - using 37% or 38% of it so far, can you explain the math there, because I think you have sold two businesses for a total of, I don\u2019t know $700 million, $800 million and so I am not understanding the math of how you get to that much usage of the capital loss carry-forward, maybe I\u2019m not understanding it and then more broadly for Sean, I mean, how do you think of value creation when you\u2019re divesting assets? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Akshay, let me take the first one. So our capital loss carry-forward was about $4 billion, we are down to about $2.5 billion and there were several kinds of pieces of that. The Spicetec and Swank divestitures we benefitted. There were some parts of the Lamb Weston spin where we utilized it. And then with the Wesson divestiture, even though we haven\u2019t closed from an accounting perspective as you saw on our release, you account for that now because it is probable that you would use it. Because as you may know, even though it is an asset on our balance sheet we fully reserve for that asset and then we use it, we get the tax benefit that goes through the P&L. So, clearly we have a track of using them as we said, we\u2019ve utilized 38% to date. So, we feel good about that progress.","Dave Marberger","And Akshay with respect to your second question, when I think about ConAgra and maximizing value I think holistically about reshaping the portfolio. And reshaping the portfolio really consists of three things: One is, strengthening the businesses we already own, and undoing a lot of legacy stuff that we\u2019ve talked about making them stronger margin for the future. Two is adding new assets to the portfolio that fit strategically with what we do that enhance our growth profile, potentially enhance our margin profile. And third would be surgically letting go of businesses that don\u2019t fit what we are doing strategically or are a chronic drag on our top line or a chronic drag on our margin structure or assets that somebody else values more materially than we do. So all those three things in together really comprise the recipe for how we\u2019re going to maximize value here at ConAgra.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Brian Kearney for his closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","Thank you. As a reminder this conference is being recorded and will be archived online as detailed in our news release. As always, we are available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra Brands.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"6548":["ConAgra Foods (NYSE:CAG) Q3 2012 Earnings Call March 22, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Gary M.

Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to today's ConAgra Foods Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I will be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning. Welcome to the call, and thanks for joining us. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll talk about our fiscal third quarter performance and share our thoughts on the balance of the fiscal year, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.","Before we get started, Chris will say a few words about housekeeping matters.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. If you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and affect our business, I will refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, our Q&A, or on our website under the Financial Reports and Filings link and then choosing Non-GAAP Reconciliations.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. As you can see from the release, EPS from continuing operations was $0.65 as reported and $0.51 on a comparable basis. Comparable EPS was up just slightly from last year. For the full fiscal year, we're committed to our goal of low- to mid-single-digit growth over the last year's comparable EPS.","Our improved capabilities have helped us deal with this very challenging environment. I'm specifically talking about our pricing progress in both segments and our continued success generating strong Consumer Foods cost savings.","Macroeconomic conditions continue to be difficult, and that weighed on our third quarter results. As you've seen across the industry, retail volumes are soft and inflation for Consumer Foods during the quarter was the highest we've seen all year at 11%.","While inflation for some commodities has eased, other areas like proteins, packaging and fuel have continued to rise dramatically. And as we've shared previously, shoppers continue to be very value-oriented and price-sensitive. So while the headwinds have been intense, our focus on the fundamentals has remained strong, and our fiscal 2012 goals remain intact.","Now I'll move on to specific segment results. Top line for the Commercial Foods segment increased 14%. That reflects pricing needed to deal with inflation and the pass-through of higher wheat costs along with good potato volumes. Segment profits were essentially equal to year ago amounts on a comparable basis, but that overall flat profit number does not reflect what we feel is important. This is a very strong growth for Lamb Weston being offset by a meaningful decline at ConAgra Mills.","Lamb Weston is making great progress capitalizing on global growth opportunities. Lamb had a standout quarter. They've successfully priced to offset inflation and have improved plant efficiencies while pursuing growth. We expect more good things to come from Lamb Weston for all the reasons we shared with you at CAGNY. It's a great business with great prospects, and we're particularly excited about our growing international presence as well as mix improvement opportunities with higher-margin products such as Sweet Potato Fries.","More than 25% of Lamb Weston's commercial reach, and I'm including unconsolidated joint ventures in this statement, is international. We're in nearly 100 countries, and we're the market leader in many of them. We're growing at a double-digit pace internationally, following the expansion of well-known foodservice customers around the world.","Within our milling operations, the first thing I'll note is that year ago profits were very strong, very much above what we would call normal. So we had a tough lap this quarter. On top of that, volatility in the grain markets did not give us the same profit opportunities we've had in the recent past. On a positive note, things are already improving for our milling operations given market conditions, and this bodes well for a better fiscal fourth quarter from this segment. Aside from any short-term issues, we continue to have an outstanding customer base, good milling assets and leading positions in growth segments like whole grains and ready-to-eat flour, so we continue to feel very good about the long-term prospects for our milling operations.","Moving on to our Consumer Foods segment. As I mentioned, we saw a sales increase of 4% overall, reflecting a 5% contribution from favorable price\/mix, a 5% organic volume decline and a 4% contribution from recent acquisitions. We continued with our net realized pricing actions during the quarter, just as we said we would. These were necessary to address the very high ongoing commodity inflation we faced, and we knew there'd be some impact on volumes.","We continue to face a very challenging marketplace, particularly for our core consumer, who is spending more cautiously given food and fuel inflation, unemployment and housing pressures. We'll navigate this environment with balanced pricing, smart marketing and cost-saving initiatives that will allow us to continue to deliver tremendous value to consumers in these economic times. And at the same time, we'll hope recent signs of a modest job recovery continue and gasoline prices recede. Within those sales results, there were several brands with good performance, such as Chef Boyardee, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter Pan and Slim Jim, to name a few.","During the fiscal third quarter, operating profit for Consumer Foods was 20% above last year's third quarter as reported. After we adjust for items impacting comparability, segment profits were down 6% due to very high input cost inflation, which more than offset the benefit from pricing, cost savings and recent acquisitions. You heard us say last quarter that we were facing our toughest inflation headwinds of the whole year in our fiscal third quarter. That's exactly how it played out at 11%. Given the circumstances, our team navigated the conditions by focusing on costs and prudent pricing actions in the midst of a turbulent environment. We expect the rate of input cost inflation to moderate in our upcoming Q4, which is a big part of why we expect modest profit growth in the Consumer Foods segment for that quarter.","When we look forward, we're confident in our top line growth prospects for all the reasons we told you about at CAGNY. Expanding into core adjacencies, growing our international footprint and capitalizing on the right private label opportunities are all key parts of our growth plans.","High-impact innovation also plays a big role in all aspects of our growth. To that point, I know you heard about and, hopefully, many of you tried some of our new products at CAGNY. Just a few weeks ago, 2 of our newer products won the 2012 Product of the Year USA awards. These are voted on by a panel of more than 50,000 consumers, and Healthy Choice Top Chef Inspired Caf\u00e9 Steamers and Orville Redenbacher's Pop Up Bowl were named 2012 Product of the Year in their respective categories, frozen and snacking. We're obviously very pleased with that consumer response.","We continue to be very excited about our innovation pipeline. The items we shared last month at CAGNY like our Healthy Choice Greek frozen yogurt, our Marie Callender's single-serve desserts, our Marie Callender's breakfast bakes and Healthy Choice dinner bakes are all frozen category growth drivers.","And as you saw, snacking innovations continue to be important for us. For example, we just launched Orville Redenbacher's new, ready-to-eat popcorn, which aims to take advantage of double-digit growth in this important category. That product joins a growing array of new snacking items that we expect to help grow our core business. One of our latest is the new Slim Jim Steakhouse line of meat snacks which we developed for a growth target for Slim Jim: males aged 18 to 29. Slim Jim had a strong quarter overall, with dollar and volume growth, and we expect the Slim Jim Kickin' Carne Asada and Smokin' Mesquite Tender Steak Strips to help deliver growth to the snacks category this year. And of course, we're accelerating our expansion into private label snacking with the pretzel company we recently bought and a strong innovation pipeline.","Further demonstrating our commitment to growth is our recent acquisition of Del Monte Canada. We're excited about the growth prospects in adjacent fruit snack categories and -- that this business brings to us. We're also pleased that we now own the market-leading brand of canned tomatoes in Canada, the Aylmer brand, a category we know very well, given our success with Hunt's and Ro*Tel brands. We have put some financial details on that acquisition in today's press release.","In closing, we expect to reach our fiscal 2012 goals by posting modest growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. There's no question that difficult industry conditions are weighing on our near-term outlook. But all-in-all, we expect the fourth quarter to show a modest rate of EPS growth for a handful of reasons: one, momentum with potato products in the Commercial Foods segment; two, an anticipated slowdown in the rate of inflation in the Consumer Foods segment; and three, the overall nature of the quarterly comparison, given last year's fourth quarter. We'll offer our thoughts on fiscal 2013 when we do our fourth quarter release in late June.","Before I turn it out over to John, I'm pleased to tell you we were named to the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index this month. This recognizes our sound fundamentals and our strong performance in an important part of our capital allocation process: dividends. We remain committed to our top-tier dividend as you've heard us say many times, and we're very pleased that we've been recognized by being included in this list.","For more on financials, here's John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to cover 4 topics this morning. I'll begin with our third quarter performance; next, I'll address comparability matters; then, on to cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, including our recent M&A activity; and finally, I'll share some brief comments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.","Starting with our third quarter performance. For the quarter, we reported net sales of $3.4 billion, up 7%, driven by the acquisitions in our Consumer Foods segment, improved pricing across both segments, volume growth in our Lamb Weston business, as well as the impact of higher wheat prices in our flour milling operations.","We reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.65 versus $0.52 in the year ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.51 versus $0.50 in the prior year quarter. While we're satisfied with the results, we continue to battle challenging conditions in our Consumer Foods segment. Our Commercial Foods segment, however, driven by strong performance in our Lamb Weston business, is on track for a strong year.","Now I'd like to provide a few details on our business segment performance. First, in our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were $1.2 billion or up 14%, reflecting improved volume and mix as well as disciplined pricing in our Lamb Weston potato operations, where we increased prices to offset higher input cost. The pass-through of higher wheat costs in our flour milling operations also contributed to this top line growth.","Overall, segment operating profit on a comparable basis was about flat. Lamb Weston posted a significant year-over-year profit increase, driven by the volume mix and pricing improvements, as well as improved operational efficiencies. The Lamb Weston performance was, however, offset by a significant profit decline in ConAgra Mills, which is a function of both a strong performance in the prior year quarter and less favorable market conditions in our third quarter this year. While the results for this segment were mixed this quarter, we do expect this segment to perform well over the balance of the fiscal year. ","In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were $2.2 billion, up 4%. The contribution from recent acquisitions was about 4%, and the net sales also reflect contribution from price\/mix of about 5%, offset by an organic volume decline of about 5%.","As we had expected, the third quarter was our most challenging quarter for inflation. Inflation for the quarter was about 11%, driven in large part by proteins, packaging and fuel. We were able to offset this inflation -- partially offset this inflation with pricing mix of about 5% and continued strong cost savings. We do expect to see year-over-year operating profit improvement in this segment in the fourth quarter, as our continued pricing and cost savings benefits are expected to more than offset more moderate inflation levels.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost-reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $65 million in the quarter. We expect these programs to deliver approximately $270 million of cost savings for the full fiscal year.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $83 million, essentially flat with the prior year quarter. And for the full fiscal year, we expect A&P to be slightly below the prior year.","For the quarter, foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on Consumer Foods net sales and operating profit. Overall, operating profit on a comparable basis for the Consumer Foods segment decreased approximately 6% from the year ago period.","Corporate expenses for the quarter were $75 million on a comparable basis versus $72 million in the year ago quarter. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 28%. This is lower than planned, largely due to the gain from the acquisition of a majority interest in Agro Tech Foods, Ltd. This again, which is included in our comparability items, is not taxable. We continue to expect that the full fiscal year tax rate will be approximately 34%, excluding items impacting comparability.","Now I'll move on to my second topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have $0.14 per diluted share of net benefit in this quarter's EPS, related to several items. First, we recognized income of $0.14 per diluted share from a $59 million gain in connection with our acquisition of a majority interest in Agro Tech Foods, Ltd., our India affiliate. This gain -- this noncash gain is not taxable and arises out of the GAAP requirements to write up to fair value our previous equity method investment upon acquiring a controlling interest.","Next, on hedging. For the third quarter, the net hedging gain included in corporate expense was $22 million or $0.03 per share.","Third, we recorded $8 million or $0.01 per share of restructuring and other one-time charges related to our cost reduction and organizational efficiency initiatives, principally in our Consumer Foods segment. These initiatives are designed to improve organizational effectiveness and to reduce costs.","And finally, we recorded approximately $12 million or $0.03 per share of expense, related to reserve adjustments for legal and insurance matters which relate to prior years.","Next I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items for the quarter. First, we ended the quarter in a strong cash position, with over $600 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Also, we are still on track to deliver strong operating cash flows for fiscal 2012. We continue to expect operating cash flows for the year to be approximately $1.3 billion, excluding the impact of any discretionary pension contributions.","On working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full fiscal year, we expect working capital improvements in our base business. We expect these will contribute to cash flows from operating activities as we continue to improve our cash conversion cycle metrics.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $79 million versus $136 million in the prior year period. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $400 million, which is down from our previous estimate of about $450 million.","Net interest expense was $50 million in the third quarter versus $52 million in the year ago quarter. Dividends for the quarter decreased slightly from the year ago quarter to $99 million, reflecting the increased dividend rate, offset by a lower number of shares.","Now let's turn to capital allocation. And I have several matters to touch on today, and let's start with growth. We have said that growth is a priority, and we are focused on strategic adjacencies, international and private label.","We have recently completed several transactions that are consistent with our growth strategy. During the quarter, we completed 2 transactions. First, as I previously mentioned, we completed a transaction that provides us with majority ownership of Agro Tech Foods, Ltd., our India affiliate. This majority ownership will enable us to further leverage this strategic platform for growth in an important emerging market. The consolidation of this business is reflected in our financial statements beginning in this, our fiscal third quarter.","Second, we closed on the acquisition of National Pretzel, the leading private label pretzel provider. This acquisition fits well with our private label strategy and with the extensive snack capabilities we already have. The acquisition and operations of this business are also reflected in our financial statements, beginning in our third quarter.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we also closed on our acquisition of Del Monte Canada for a purchase price of approximately $185 million. Annual sales for Del Monte Canada have been approximately $150 million. This acquisition fits well with our existing capabilities and expands our portfolio and presence in the Canadian market in a meaningful way. We don't expect any significant EPS impact from Del Monte Canada for the remainder of fiscal 2012.","I would also note that we were able to fund all of these transactions out of cash on hand.","We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities where there is a strategic fit and a good financial return. And we are confident that we can further leverage our capabilities and our balance sheet to create value by investing for growth in a disciplined manner.","We also remain focused on organic growth and profit enhancement investments, including new product introductions and capacity expansions, as well as investments necessary to support our strong cost savings initiatives. The other elements of our capital allocation policy also remain unchanged. And given our track record of consistent cash flow generation, we believe that we can continue to have a very balanced approach to capital allocation over the long term. This approach starts with our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating, but also recognizes the importance of maintaining our strong dividend and executing share repurchases from time to time.","With respect to our dividend, as Gary mentioned, this month we have been added to the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, and we see this as validation of our commitment to and our track record of consistently providing a strong dividend return to our shareholders. On share repurchases, we did repurchase a small amount of shares in the third quarter, and we currently have approximately $775 million of available share repurchase authorization.","Before I close, I would like to comment briefly on our 2012 outlook. As Gary mentioned, we continue to expect fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow at a rate in the low to mid-single digits from our 2011 comparable base of $1.75 per share. To achieve our full year guidance, we expect modest comparable EPS growth in the fourth quarter resulting from strong momentum in potato products and moderating inflation and, therefore, improved year-over-year profitability in our Consumer Foods segment.","Overall, the environment, especially related to our Consumer Foods segment, remains challenging. But we continue to have confidence that we can leverage our pricing and cost savings initiatives, as well as our innovation and marketing capabilities across both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments to position our company for long-term success.","That concludes our formal remarks. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Andr\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator for the Q&A session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones for me. First, I think you mentioned that advertising spending in the quarter was roughly flattish. I think, last quarter, you had mentioned that the third quarter might be a bit heavier ramp in advertising, and that's why you expected sort of better earnings growth in the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what might have changed there. And then just secondly, you talked about Consumer Foods getting back to some EBIT growth in the fourth quarter, primarily as inflation starts to moderate a bit. Just want to get a sense of if there's any sort of additional visibility around the top line and the volume side. I've not heard a bunch of other companies talk yet about a real positive inflection, but want to get a better sense from you on how you see kind of volume playing out, perhaps, in the fourth quarter.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew, I think you're pretty much on target. We're in line with what you're hearing. We certainly don't expect where we are in volume to be our long-term norm, but the near-term environment across the industry is certainly continuing to be difficult. And it's primarily because consumers, other than maybe those in the top quintile of income, are still struggling and having to adjust to higher everyday costs like food and fuel. We're working our way through this with a real intense focus on cost, productivity, overhead control, but we're equally focused on growth through innovation, marketing, enhanced customer planning and acquisitions. But the near-term environment continues to be tough. Eventually, this tough cost and consumer environment is going to get better, and our core portfolio will benefit from that. And we're looking ahead, of course, to gradually lapping all the net pricing actions that were necessitated by this high, high inflation. So we think near term, we're still in a tough environment. Longer-term, we feel good.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just on the marketing side.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Andrew, this is Andr\u00e9. We moved -- your points are dead accurate in terms of what we talked about in Q2. We did see, based on some of the factors that Gary mentioned, the need to move some of our marketing out of Q3 into Q4 to better line up with some of the things that you saw at CAGNY that we were starting to put in the marketplace. So a lot of that was just movement from quarter-to-quarter that we saw that was necessitated by some of the things that Gary articulated, but also to line up with some of the product movement and shipment of our new items.","Operator","And we'll move next to Citi with David Driscoll.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to go, Gary, back to kind of the high-level question here on Consumer Foods. Andr\u00e9, you might want to chime in as well. But you've often talked about the value-oriented nature of the portfolio. The weakness on volumes right now, I mean, sure, I very much understand the inflation point. But I keep thinking that the nature of your portfolio should be performing, in my mind, better than it is, or at least in what I expected it to do, given this very strong value orientation of it. Can you try to -- can you connect a few dots for me and maybe explain if the weakened consumer, why aren't they coming to this portfolio? Your channel mix, is there a problem there where you're just not penetrating to the level that you need to in some of these low-cost alternate channels? How should we think about it -- just -- maybe let me stop there, and I'll follow-up.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, this is a -- this has always been a tough, tough question, and it's really all about the disproportionate impact that this tough environment, whether it's jobs, housing, inflation of everyday goods, is having on our core consumer, which is the bulk of the population, call it the middle and lower income folks who buy those value products. They are the ones who are hurting the most, and it's not getting a whole lot better for them yet. So we're still going through a period of adjustment that hopefully, we're going to be able to lap all of this pricing, as I said before. And eventually as jobs and housing and fuel get a little bit better, our core portfolio should perform better.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","And, David, just to your point of me chiming in, I would say that one of the things we talked about at the end of our second quarter earnings call was the fact that we would be taking pricing on that value portfolio as well. And I would say that while for many of us, maybe moving from $0.88 banquet meals to $1 is not a lot, to that consumer, that is a significant increase, and that's what we saw in a lot of our value brands. They also are susceptible to inflation, and we had to take pricing. So we knew it would be a disproportionate short-term issue. We talked about that. And we believe, to Gary's point, that, that gets significantly better as we start to move and lap that. But that was what one of the biggest effects was on our value portfolio.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's really helpful. Just one fast follow-up here on the P&L. Corporate expense for the quarter, is that an appropriate run rate? It came in a lot lower than we thought. Is that the rate -- run rate that we should be at? I know you guys struggle with this question as much as we do, but any insights? And on the joint venture line, nice improvement there. You wrote some commentary in there about a turnaround in that business. How do you think about $13 million a quarter going forward?","Chris Klinefelter","David, this is Chris. I'll start and say that as far as corporate, you're right. The best thing we can do there is just to guide you that for a full year basis, we generally look at something in the mid-3s as a normalized run rate. In terms of the equity method earnings, we are definitely seeing a turnaround improvement in the potato joint venture that we cite in the release. As far as giving a hard number by quarter, I'm a little reluctant to do that. But it's definitely safe to assume that the trends are moving in the right direction.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But today's number is much more reflective of what it should be doing, give or take, than prior numbers.","Chris Klinefelter","That's fair. And then some of the years where it was toward the top of its range, this would be the rate that it showed. Right.","Operator","And we'll move now to Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","My first question is one of the -- you're reporting a quarter that included December, which was weak both on a measured basis and across the -- on a shipment basis for the entire industry it seems. Was there a market difference in your shipment linearity between December and, say, February exiting the quarter? Like would we see improvement over the course of the quarter? Just in Consumer Foods is what I'm curious about.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Jonathan, this is Andr\u00e9. We did not see a significant change from when we entered the quarter, relative to both consumption in units and in dollars, and when we exited. I think the comments that Gary made about a challenging consumer environment, the fact that our pricing was about 5%, no, we did not see any significant change either in consumption. I would say that the other piece would be that our non-measured channels and the businesses there are performing slightly better than our grocery or syndicated channel business. But again, we didn't see any significant trends both entering the quarter and exiting the quarter that would be material in our view.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So just following up then, thinking about -- we came into this year talking about low- to mid-single-digit earnings, and now I guess we're kind of talking about modest -- a sort of new language about it. I guess -- I mean, do we feel like -- when you look at how we're feeling about Q4 versus where we were, I mean, is it really sort of like 1% or 2% now at this point we're looking for? I mean, I know low to mid-single digit gives you a wide range, and you certainly could reaffirm. But I guess when I hear the word modest -- that's new, Gary, I kind of think -- it sounds to me like that's sort of a -- maybe a little bit more conservative than it's been in the past. Is that a fair comment?","Chris Klinefelter","Jonathan, this is Chris. I'll start and say that -- we're pretty clear in the release that we have downwardly revised our outlook for Q4. We do expect growth. The \"modest\" that you're describing has to do with our outlook for Q4. What we generally mean there is something in the single-digit range, and that would result in a year's contribution that puts us in the range that we've talked about.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just following up on that because I was thinking that, that word \"modest\" was particularly modest, given the fact that the 2% to 3% EPS growth for the year would seem to imply something closer to double-digit in the fourth quarter, but you're not seeing it that way, that modest in the fourth quarter gets you to the low single digit for the year.","Chris Klinefelter","This is Chris. Yes, I think you're thinking the right way on that, Dave.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, the right way meaning that pushing double-digit would be what you would need to get to a 2% to 3% for the year?","Chris Klinefelter","That's right. However, what we're telling you is that we do expect a modest EPS growth in the fourth quarter. That would put us at a low single digit for the year, which was in the range of what we've talked about.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. The milling business, could you educate us a little bit about what happened in the quarter? In the past, I had understood that volatile trading environment would be good, but you said volatility in it was bad this quarter and somehow was getting better into the fourth quarter. Could you just comment on that a little bit?","Paul T. Maass","Sure. This is Paul. And the overall conditions in the -- John had commented, first of all, a very tough lap. So we had a really good quarter a year ago, so that was a piece of it. And as far as the market environment, in general, you're correct. Volatility translates into a better operating environment for us. In a lot of commodity markets, there remains a lot of volatility. Wheat actually has been less so. And when we look to the fourth quarter, part of it is the comp again. So we look -- it looks a little bit more favorable from a quarter-over-quarter comp. And then the market -- overall, the market dynamics are somewhat improving versus what we went through here in the third quarter.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And one last one. On the weather, is it impossible at this point for ConAgra or any food company to back out how much the weather has been a drag in the business? Or have you thought about how much you could possibly tease that out from just the regular price elasticity dynamics and other consumer weakness?","Paul T. Maass","Yes, David, I wouldn't -- I mean, I wouldn't hazard a guess. I mean, I think if you look at one of our most seasonal items and one that is just spot on with the weather, it would be our cocoa business. The category, just cocoa in general, is down about 28% to 30%. So you could back that out and -- there are other businesses that we have that are very weather-related because of the way people cook at home and things like that. But that sounds to me then like a weather report and another excuse, and we'd rather just not go down that path, quite frankly. Weather did have some effect, but I wouldn't be able to correlate it to a case count number. I don't think it's -- I don't think it adds a lot of value to the discussion.","Operator","And we'll move now to Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I just had kind of an easy question, I hope, on capital allocation. I know you stated today that your CapEx, I guess, target for the year went from about $450 million to $400 million. So wanted to get a little color as to what was happening there. And then the follow-up was just -- it just sounded like the tone around share repurchase kind of shifted a little bit from what you were saying at CAGNY. It sounded like -- at CAGNY, you were kind of saying you have $780 million or so under authorization. You were looking to basically exhaust that within 2 or 3 years. And then today, it just sounds like you were saying the 3 pillars of shareholder value that you can return, that you would do share repurchases from time to time. And then when we look at Q3, you bought back 7 million in shares, which is great. It's a positive, but it just seemed like -- it just seems like, especially with CapEx coming down a little bit, that you would have more ability to be buying back more shares than you did in Q3. So really, just CapEx and share buyback.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, let me start on the share buyback. First of all, I would emphasize that we've -- there was certainly no intended change in our tone around share buyback from -- over the last couple of months or couple of quarters for that matter. I think it's important to note that we did use a lot of cash this quarter for acquisitions. And we've always said we're going to be disciplined and prudent about share buyback, but it will be lumpy from time to time. But there is no change in our commitment to share buyback. It's an important part of our capital allocation policy. On the CapEx, I guess, first, I just want to emphasize that the reduction in our CapEx forecast for this year does not reflect any decisions to delay either infrastructure or growth projects. We're not cutting any corners on safety or -- nor are we going to be delaying any growth or cost savings projects that were ready to go. I think the lower CapEx estimate does reflect some changes in project timing, as well as we entered the year -- we have certain amounts that are unidentified or held for unidentified projects and\/or contingency, and some of those amounts we just don't see as being needed this year. I would also note that we've obviously focused a little bit more attention this year, and more capital for that matter, on M&A activity. So overall, what I'd say is we're still working very hard on growth, and we feel very good about the capital we put through our infrastructure.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could you walk me through your thought process in regards to pricing? You're pricing less than the industry and competitors. How much is that driven by trying to balance volume losses and offsetting commodity cost increases, versus not creating too much of a fixed-cost absorption issue?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Thilo, this is Andr\u00e9. I'll take the first part of that if -- or maybe take all of it. I would say that I think you have to look at the categories in which we compete. I would say that if you aggregate the basket, your comment is directionally correct. But as we look at the categories we compete in and the pricing we have taken, in many categories we have actually led pricing. So for instance, in tomatoes, we've clearly led pricing. In frozen foods, we've clearly led pricing. So I think you have to get a lot more granular and take a look at the categories. And I would say that in many of our categories, we are at high levels of pricing against our competitive set. I think the factors that you mentioned, we're always trying to balance the right -- what's the right volume equation to manage absorption and all those kind of things. But I think we have shown -- certainly, this year, as we've put in a lot of the Customer Connect principles that we've talked about, that we have taken a very disciplined approach to total margin management. And that is -- we're trickling that down throughout the entire organization. So I feel very good about the pricing that we have taken, given where ConAgra was in the consumer space historically.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then ACT II had the first positive quarter since 3 or 4 years. What's behind that? Is that a reflection of the consumer?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","I think there's a little bit of that. Again, our total -- we look at our total popcorn business. I would say that I would not look at one quarter as an outlier for that brand. I do think, though, it's got some value positioning. It operates also broadly, and not just syndicated channels, also has a broad portfolio outside of that in club and a couple of other areas. So I think we've done fairly well with that brand. But I wouldn't draw any conclusions for one quarter.","Operator","And we'll hear now from Davenport's Ann Gurkin.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. One, can we spend a little time on the milling business and what you think could happen to the size of the wheat crop, the wheat prices for calendar '12? In other words, what are we looking for, for that business in the second half of this calendar year? If you could start with that.","Paul T. Maass","Sure. So overall, I think the market dynamics on wheat are probably less favorable than we had, had over the last several years. I think when you look at the overall supply and demand fundamentals, there should be ample wheat for -- when you look at new crop and the conditions that we're facing, I think there's -- from our perspective, we believe there will be ample wheat. And that should be a pretty favorable position for us. Is there anything else you wanted on milling?","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Pretty favorable position in terms of size of the crop, is that what you're saying?","Paul T. Maass","Yes. Not only size of the crop, but I think then, when you transition from one crop cycle to the next, that all that -- at this point, everything looks like we should have a smooth transition.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then at CAGNY, you all talked about on joint business planning and working with retailers. I was just wondering if we can get an update behind that strategy.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Ann, this is Andr\u00e9. We continue to do very well. We've had a lot of sessions. Doug, our Head of Sales, attended business conference suites, which is bringing together a lot of retailers and manufacturers. We continue to get very high marks from retailers about the collaborative nature of our joint business planning, the innovation we're bringing to bear, the shopper marketing tools we're bringing to bear and the insights. So again, as I mentioned to you when I saw you down at CAGNY, I think it is a journey that we're on. We are putting a lot of new muscle into this area, including the work we're doing on pricing and total margin management that I spoke about. But I feel really good. And I think unsolicited, we have heard from a lot of our customers the very difference that they're seeing in sort of, I would call it, the new ConAgra. And our sales teams are doing very well against pushing those initiatives through and having really quality dialogues with our customers.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Has it resulted in product placements, new customer wins? Anything...","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Oh, I think so. I mean -- again, new customer wins is a -- we cover a lot of customers today, and there's not a lot of places where you cannot find ConAgra products. I do believe it has resulted in us working with them, specifically on innovation, around points of distribution. If you look at our record and our results and total points of distribution, we continue to be at the top end of the industry in terms of getting our new items put on shelf and in the frozen case, across the universe of customers. So we do a very good job there.","Operator","And we'll hear a question now from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The futures market for corn seems to be implying a large crop with some healthy yields this summer and maybe that comes to pass. But at some point, whether it's this year, next year, after, costs for the industry are going to rise again and perhaps steeply. I'm just wondering if maybe the industry is in a situation, right, considering recent elasticities, where that next time around we'd really need corn to stay cheap more than we usually do. Because the price elasticity we've seen lately, not just for you but also for your peers, perhaps has cut into the appetite for price increases going forward. So I'm curious if that's the case in your view. And if it is the case, maybe manufacturers will have to eat some more margin next time around in order to maintain volumes. How should we think about that, industry-wide, in your view? Has there been a structural change in appetite for price increases after this experience?","Paul T. Maass","This is Paul, and I would comment just a little bit on the corn market. Clearly, the structure is -- it's in a pretty big inverse. So as you say, the forecast is for record planted acres this spring, translated into a record crop. If you play that cycle through, that should have an impact on prices, and that's reflected in the futures markets today. I think I would comment that the world has responded to overall higher prices, so you're seeing production impacts across the globe. And from my vantage point in particular, it's really critical that we stay aligned on what our input costs are and we price appropriately. And we've got a -- if we have inflation, we've got to price it through. If we end up in a situation long-term where there's some deflation, we would be expected to adjust as well. But -- so our focus here from an operations perspective is really staying aligned with input costs and pricing.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So you don't think there's been a shift in, at least from your perspective, mentality and maybe nerves aren't frayed, and you will take pricing again next time if you have to.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. Ken, this is Gary. I think the industry, certainly ConAgra, and even on the customer side, understands well how important it is to have pricing discipline. And I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that there are periods of adjustment. So you've got to be able to get folks used to the new price. You've got to overlap it. But you have to keep your margin structure in place to be able to continue to drive the business. And that's, I think, a lesson learned for the entire industry. One important thing to remember is that we as Americans continue to spend, by far, the lowest percentage of our income per capita on food. So it's very different from the rest of the world. And we'll just have to continue to make those adjustments.","Operator","And we'll move now to Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess looking out to next year, I know you're not prepared to make a full forecast, but can -- maybe you could just comment on the -- given the acquisition activity you've made so far, based on your numbers, how much of that should contribute to consolidated sales? And if there is at this point a contribution to earnings, how much that -- how much we should think about?","Chris Klinefelter","Eric, this is Chris. Why don't I start with that? So to your point, we're not in position to give anything very specific on fiscal '13. It's also safe to assume, though, that when we do acquisitions here and there, obviously we expect them to contribute earnings. In our long-term algorithm, the commitment of 6% to 8%, we expect some contribution from capital allocation in a generic fashion. That could come from a small acquisition here or there, which is the period we're in most recently, or it could come from buying back stock, paying off debt, that type of thing. So it's safe to assume that it will be part of the earnings stream and that they do add a little something here or there. But to get too specific at this point, we just need to wait.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess to follow-up on Jonathan Feeney's question, not to -- just to understand, because like the fifth bullet point of your release today said you kind of reiterated low to middle single -- mid-single-digit earnings growth this year. You -- I think it's appropriate in this environment to be cautious. Is the mid-single digit -- is that like a function of, let's say, some of the less predictable businesses in the portfolio? Like if grain milling opportunities arise or Lamb Weston continues to do as well as it is, is that what could get you to that mid-single digit for the year? Or is that basically not really reasonable, and it's just -- it's low-single digit and the fifth bullet point in your release isn't really accurate or appropriate at this point?","Chris Klinefelter","Now, Eric, this is Chris. Let me say we've been talking about a range all year, so we reiterated the guidance of our range. However, within that range, it is safe to assume that if we have a modest Q4, that it's going to be a low-single-digit rate of growth, which is on the low end of the range. It's because we're going to follow it in the range, which is why we use the language we've been using all year.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last thing and I'll pass it on. But Gary, you've been in the CPG world for a long time, and I assume you've heard other companies talk about it and some -- given the current environment, some people have blamed weather. Others have talked about inventory de-load. But I mean, it sounds like you're of the -- in the camp where we unfortunately, in this country, have a percentage of the population that's basically going to bed hungry every night. Is that kind of how you see it, as unfortunate as it is?","Gary M. Rodkin","Well, there's certainly a small percentage like that, but that's probably a little extreme. But I would tell you that until we start to see a significant turn for most folks, not just the top quintile which drives a lot of what we're seeing in the stock market today, we're going to have people make adjustments, and we're going to have to get past these overlaps because when you earn -- when your household earns $50,000 a year and you've got to spend however much more at the grocery store and at the gas station, that has an impact. And that has to get overlapped. And that has to get adjusted to. And hopefully, if this recovery -- overall economic recovery starts to trickle down, then we will see things get a bit better. But right now, it's a tough environment for most of the core consumers in the CPG world.","Operator","And we have a question now from Sanford Bernstein's Alexia Howard.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask about the volume momentum for Lamb Weston? You mentioned the international business. Was that the primary driver, the geographic expansion and momentum that you have with some of those quick-service restaurants overseas? And perhaps you could also comment on how the volumes look for Lamb Weston here in the U.S. I think we saw yesterday some data from General Mills saying that even though sales at quick-service restaurants have picked up, the average traffic has not picked up much at all. So I just wanted to get a sense for what you're seeing as the drivers of volume growth on the Lamb Weston side.","Gary M. Rodkin","Perfect. Thank you. Volume, what I would comment on -- first of all, volume in Commercial Foods was favorable across the entire business. Lamb Weston particular, the volume was highlighted by growth in international. The other thing I'd comment on is mix. And so focusing on innovation to drive volume, especially domestically. So we're seeing a lot of traction with Sweet Potato Fries and other innovations that we have. And so I would describe the U.S. volume as being favorable but probably driven more by mix, and overall volume being favorable, driven more by our focus internationally.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up on frozen entr\u00e9es. Given what you've said around the weakness that I think also applied to that category, is that continued category weakness? Or is it a trade down to private label? I don't think that's particularly important in that segment. But just some color on what you're seeing there.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Alexia, this is Andr\u00e9. You're absolutely right. The private label really makes -- doesn't make much of a difference in that single-serve entr\u00e9e business. I think, as I mentioned, we took pricing in the value end of that category, and that's probably where we saw the most softness. You'll note that, that category is really -- there's really 3 elements, so I've just spoken about the economy. The health segment there, where there's 3 key players with which we play there, has been under fire now for quite some time relative to where consumers are going. So that category was soft. But we held our own there. And where we've seen the best growth in our portfolio and where -- is really with Marie Callender on the premium side. So remember, our strategy in frozen has us really shooting to win in single-serve meals, but really pushing out into adjacencies. We've been very successful with the Marie Callender Bakes item. Our business is up and we're gaining share in multi-serve, which is also another important component of the frozen business. And we also talked about adjacencies, specifically dessert, where we are also doing very well with the Marie Callender. And the Banquet equity with fruit pies there have done very, very well. And if you were at CAGNY, you will see the new items that we're bringing to the entire frozen case, both on meals but also, importantly, with desserts and also the new Healthy Choice frozen Greek yogurt items. So we're doing -- we feel we're doing very well in frozen. The challenge, to your point, has been that single-serve meal occasion, and I hopefully answered your -- in the 3 tiers that we look at there, what is going on in that business.","Operator","And there are no further questions. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. Before we sign off, I'd just like to say I know we all are aware how tough this environment is. But it's really important to think a little bit longer-term. And as we said at CAGNY, and I think articulated in some detail, we've got a well mapped out strategic plan. We call it our Recipe for Growth. We are following that road map, and we've made several acquisitions already that you've seen to advance toward the gradual reshaping of our portfolio. And that, combined with the better fundamentals that we've spoken about and the very strong balance sheet, does give us confidence in the future. And again, this tough cost and consumer environment eventually is going to get better at some point. And when it does, our core portfolio is going to benefit from that. So tough environment today, but still continue to be very confident about the future.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you, Gary. And to our audience members -- I mean, just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. And as always, we are available for discussions. Thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods.","Operator","This concludes today's ConAgra Foods Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

References to Legacy Conagra Brands refer to measures that exclude any income or expenses associated with the recently acquired Pinnacle Foods business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call.","Fiscal 2020 is on track following a very solid Q1. We continue to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth by executing against the principles and plan we shared at Investor Day. We're applying our value-over-volume playbook to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio, and we've made important progress strengthening the foundation of the business and repositioning Pinnacle\u2019s leadership brands for profitable growth. We're also pleased to report that our ongoing integration and synergy capture related to the Pinnacle business and our deleveraging progress remain squarely on track. In Legacy Conagra, we continued to deliver solid execution and maintained our momentum in the first quarter, particularly in our leading frozen and snacks businesses.","Looking ahead, we remain confident that our second half results will reflect stronger growth than the first half. We'll lap the anniversary of the Pinnacle acquisition, and the easier comps due to the start of our value-over-volume execution across its portfolio. We'll also begin to benefit from the exciting new innovations that are being introduced to the market. Therefore, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 guidance for all previously communicated metrics.","Our agenda this morning is to provide an update on our work on the Legacy Pinnacle business, discuss our continued progress on Legacy Conagra, and share some additional details on our expectations for the remainder of the year.","Turning to the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio. Before diving into the details here, I'd like to take a step back and review the central tenets of our value-over-volume playbook, which is essentially our approach to optimizing the base business and establishing a stronger foundation on which to build. As you've heard me say before, value-over-volume is a disciplined approach to growth that acknowledges not all volume is created equal and consumer demands are always evolving. The approach dictates that we consistently apply rigorous portfolio management. Value-over-volume involves eliminating weaker SKUs in advance of the launch of higher performing new products and the associated brand building investments. It also involves renovating the core and getting the fundamentals right. These fundamentals include pricing, promotion, assortment, distribution, product quality and packaging. We've previously shared that our application of value-over-volumes of a Legacy Pinnacle portfolio would be a key priority.","As you can see on slide seven, we're making real progress. In fact, we're seeing very similar patterns to what we saw in Legacy Conagra a few years ago. We've trimmed low quality SKUs from the marketplace, we've seen TPDs decline near-term. But importantly, we've also seen base velocities improve sharply. We demonstrated on brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice in Legacy Conagra. This creates a much stronger foundation on which to infuse brand building investments.","Wish-Bone is one of the key Legacy Pinnacle brands, where we're furthest along in strengthening the foundation. As we've discussed previously, Wish-Bone was challenged by several issues, service, quality and the label change executions. We identified the issues and took action, fixing the service challenges, improving labels for better variety communication and also upgrading the product quality.","As you can see on slide eight, we\u2019ve stabilized the business; in fact, we grew it in Q1. We also remain highly focused on executing our playbook on the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands. Low performing SKUs have come out of the market and fundamentals are improving. Keep in mind that we're in the very early stages of recognizing the benefits from our new innovations in these categories. The shelf reset windows at large customers are different than they are for Wish-Bone. So, the timing of their recoveries is different. We do anticipate improvement in the second half of fiscal 2020 for both of these brands as they begin to benefit from the addition of our new innovation slate. We're confident that the Birds Eye and Duncan Hines brands will continue to stabilize and are on track for profitable growth.","We also remain on track across all our integrations, synergies, and deleveraging initiatives as highlighted on slide 10. Across the board, we're very pleased with the execution of our integration activities. Our employee related transitions are now substantially complete. And since the close of the transaction through the end of Q1, we've realized $71 million of cost synergies.","From a balance sheet perspective, we're on schedule with our deleveraging plan, having reduced total gross debt by $148 million in the first quarter and by more than $1 billion from the transaction close through the end of Q1. As we consistently said, we remain firmly committed to maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating.","Overall, we had a solid first quarter on Legacy Pinnacle; we've made good progress in strengthening the foundation across the portfolio and look forward to continued improvement in the back half of the year as we begin to benefit from the new innovations.","Turning to Legacy Conagra. The business started the year well, and we're pleased with the trends we're seeing. The Legacy Conagra business delivered solid performance during the quarter. Together, the two large domestic retail businesses outperformed their planned organic net sales growth. Yet again, we saw terrific momentum in our Legacy Conagra frozen and snacks businesses. As expected, our grocery sales performance in Q1 was impacted by some holdover from the Hunt's and Chef Boyardee dynamics that we detailed last quarter. As we'll share with you today, we have action plans in place and trends are already improving.","But we also experienced some unplanned softness in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter. And this negatively impacted our top-line performance. This softness relates to some onetime issues, and both segments are expected to recover in the second half. Importantly, despite these top-line headwinds, our International and Foodservice segments overdelivered their profit plans for the quarter. Let's get into each of these items in more detail.","Turning to slide 13. You can see that total retail sales for the Legacy Conagra business were up 0.9% from the same period a year ago, demonstrating 2.7% growth over the two-year period. While I'll walk you through the year-on-year drivers of the fiscal year in a moment, you can see in this chart that the two-year growth rate has been fairly stable for the past four quarters and we're entering a period of easier comparisons on a one-year basis.","On slide 14, you can see that we continued our momentum in the Legacy Conagra frozen portfolio throughout the first quarter with retail sales growing 2.5%. In addition, our Legacy Conagra frozen meals business continued to outperform our peers in Q1. In fact, it has become the industry leader in the frozen category. Our Legacy Conagra meals -- frozen meals business now has the number one position in share of total retail sales and gained share of category dollars in Q1.","Slide 16 demonstrates that we\u2019re also gaining share of shelf. As we\u2019ve discussed, in some instances, our actions to remove low-performing products drives lower TPDs as we create more holding power for our higher velocity items. In other cases, we've seen TPDs expand. In either event, our goal is to grow share of shelf. And that's exactly what we're doing.","As we know, our retail customers run the ultimate meritocracy. They will give more space to the products that move up the shelf the fastest. This data demonstrates that we're earning more shelf space by having products that consumers demand. Importantly, shelf space is a leading indicator that bodes well for our opportunity to grow sales.","Frozen wasn't the only leader in our Legacy Conagra portfolio in Q1. Snacks also maintained momentum through the first quarter and delivered strong results across a variety of brands and categories. Total retail sales in snacks were up an impressive 7.2% versus a year ago. Meat snacks and seeds emerged as particularly strong leaders with an increase in retail sales of 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively. Overall retail dollar sales in snacks demonstrated sustained performance improvement throughout the first quarter, having grown 9.8% on a two-year basis.","Similar to frozen, our Legacy Conagra snacks business is also outperforming its peers and gaining share as demonstrated on slide 18.","Turning to the Legacy Conagra grocery portfolio for a moment. If you recall, last quarter, we faced headwinds in our grocery portfolio related to pricing and promotional challenges. As the cost of steel cans increased, we implemented inflation justified pricing on Hunt's canned tomatoes and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost. However, our private label competition in canned tomatoes kept prices flat and in some instances, actually decreased prices. And on Chef Boyardee we lost some high quality merchandising. The effect of these dynamics was a higher than expected volume decline in Q4. We planned for this decline to continue through the first quarter as a carryover from Q4, and it did. We've already begun implementing action plans for each of these brands to reverse this trend.","Before I get to the year to go, I'll cover Foodservice and International. As I mentioned earlier, we faced some unplanned softness in the top-line performance in our International and Foodservice segments during the quarter. International segment was impacted by external events in Puerto Rico and India that shifted the timing of sales previously expected in Q1 to the second half. While this shift in timing impacts our quarter-to-quarter results, we expect that it will have no net impact on the top-line for the fiscal year. Partially offsetting this timing shift, our International segment benefited from growth in snacks and frozen, the improved mix as well as cost savings resulted in higher than planned operating profit and margins in the quarter.","In our Foodservice segment, we made the strategic decision this quarter to opt out of a particularly low margin contract, consistent with our value-over-volume strategy. While this decision negatively impacted our top-line in the near term, it was the right thing to do for the health of the business, and benefited our Q1 margins in the segment. Furthermore, we expect stronger top-line performance in Foodservice for the balance of the year with new items coming to market. We also expect better than anticipated performance from Gardein within the Foodservice segment, which will start to be included in our organic number during the second quarter.","Looking ahead, we're excited about what's to come in the back half of the year. First, we are providing more promotional support on Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to better compete in market. Second, we've got a strong investment plan for Q2 for the new innovation that's about to hit the market. In fact, the second quarter will mark the peak of our investment cycle as we incur launch expenses to tee up our slate of new products. And third, we expect terrific second half growth. We'll see innovation build across many of our segments in the second half of the year. We expect our in-store presence to be much stronger and drive growth. Some categories this will be on the back of increased TPDs and in others, it will come on the back of increased facings on high velocity items.","We'll also benefit from easier comparisons in the back half of the year, as we ramp prior year value or volume activity and increased competition. In addition, we\u2019ll lap the anniversary of our Pinnacle acquisition, discreet supply chain disruptions, and the higher interest expense and share count that started in Q2 of last year.","Let's go into each of these items in a bit more detail. Starting in the second quarter, we began launching new, smart promotional support for Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to improve volume trends. Remember, Hunt's and Chef Boyardee continued to maintain the number one position in their categories among branded competitors. Both brands are of critical importance to consumers.","We're already seeing early traction on both brands, as demonstrated on slide 23. The first two weeks of our second quarter have shown the benefit of these strategic promotions. It\u2019s certainly early days, and we have some tougher comps in the weeks ahead, given the year ago hurricane activity. But, we're confident that we have the right marketplace strategies now in place to deliver sequential improvement throughout the second half of the year.","We're also excited to introduce exciting new products to our $2 billion snacks portfolio throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our latest innovation slate, a portion of which is shown here, will premiere at NACS in October. We're delivering products with bold flavors, new forms, and optimized price pack architecture. Any of you are at NACS, please stop by our booth to see this great work for yourself.","We're proud of our snacks portfolio; it\u2019s one of the fastest growing. We're confident that our continued innovation in the space will further differentiate and elevate our already iconic brands. We're also excited about our new Conagra Brands Center for Food Design, which we expect to open in the first calendar quarter of 2020, next door to our headquarters in Chicago. This is an expansion of our state-of-the-art, R&D and culinary capabilities, and will be exclusively focused on snacking related innovation. This facility will combine culinary, food and packaging design expertise in one space, enabling the rapid development of even more contemporary snacking products.","We're also introducing reinvigorated innovation to our sweet treats portfolio in the back half of the year across both Legacy Pinnacle and Legacy Conagra Brands. Duncan Hines is being reframed as a sweet treat to unlock significant growing demand spaces with refreshed packaging, fun and novel flavors and new snacking platforms.","Legacy Conagra's snacking brands will also receive an injection of innovation to capture consumer excitement with trending kid friendly themes.","We plan to build upon our category leading position in frozen by introducing our strongest innovation slate to date throughout the balance of fiscal 2020. We've been strategically tailoring our products to fit the needs of today's busy consumers by providing them with premium, nutritious ingredients and increasing sustainability, all at affordable price points.","Birds Eye is expected to benefit meaningfully from these efforts. We expect Birds Eye performance to accelerate in the second half as we see the impacts of our recently launched innovation slate, as well as upcoming new product introductions, including spiralized zucchini. As one of the largest brands in frozen vegetables, we're confident that Birds Eye is well positioned to capitalize on contemporary forms and trending flavors.","Another brand in our portfolio with significant growth opportunity is Gardein, which we spoke about at length last quarter. We're working hard to continue to build out the Gardein brand to capitalize on the explosive growth in the plant-based meat-alternative space. The Gardein foodservice business grew an impressive 25% in the first quarter, and continues to accelerate penetration across multiple Foodservice channels. As we shared with you last quarter, the brand is the second largest in the plant-based meat alternative space, and has already quadrupled in size over the past four years.","In retail, we expect our Gardein to gain prominence in both frozen and refrigerated as we introduce more high-quality innovation. On-trend brand with modern attributes, Gardein is uniquely positioned to generate superior velocities by leveraging Conagra's culinary capabilities, differentiated packaging techniques, and our diverse portfolio of power brands. And we are well-positioned to support Gardein's continued growth with new capacity coming on line during Q2.","Overall, we're pleased with the progress Conagra has made in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. We're on track with our plan and confident in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half of the year and deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David Marberger","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone.","This morning, I'll walk through our first quarter fiscal \u201820 performance before we open it up for questions. As a reminder, starting this quarter, Conagra no longer reports Pinnacle as a standalone reporting segment. Pinnacle's business components have been allocated to the four Legacy Conagra reporting segments to reflect how we are now managing the business. You can find historical segment financial information that reflects this recast in an 8-K furnished with the SEC on September 23rd.","Slide 31 outlines our performance for the quarter. I'll walk through more detail in a moment, but I'll start here by noting a few highlights. Compared to the same period a year ago, net sales for the first quarter were up 30.3%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales were down 1.7%. The decrease in organic sales was primarily driven by the unplanned softness in International and Foodservice, and the planned declines in our Grocery & Snacks segment that Sean discussed.","Adjusted operating profit for the first quarter was up 40% and adjusted operating margin increased 108 basis points to 15.7%, which was ahead of our internal expectations.","I'll walk you through the adjusted EPS bridge in a moment. However, I want to highlight that while our adjusted EPS decreased 8.5% to $0.43 for the quarter, adjusted net income increased 12.5%. Our increase in operating profit more than offset the impact of the increased interest expense associated with the Pinnacle transaction.","Slide 32 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales versus the same period a year ago. We continued to drive an increase in price mix, even after taking into account our increases in retailer investments to support brand building. It should also be noted that the 32.1% increase from acquisitions and divestitures includes 3.7 percentage points of decrease from the sales of the Wesson oil, Gelit and Canadian Del Monte businesses and the Trenton production facility.","Slide 33 provides a summary of net sales by segment for the first quarter. Again, the Legacy Pinnacle business has been allocated to the four other reporting segments. So, we are not showing in Pinnacle segment anymore. I will discuss Pinnacle Q1 net sales in more detail shortly. ","Grocery & Snacks net sales increased 26.9% in Q1 as the acquisition of Pinnacle added 34.7% and the divestiture of Wesson oil subtracted 4.1% from the net sales growth rate. Organic net sales for Grocery & Snacks decreased 3.7% as the planned declines in Hunt's tomatoes and Chef Boyardee were partially offset by continued strong in-market performance and innovation success in our snacks business.","The Refrigerated & Frozen segment benefited once again from our robust slate of innovation across multiple Legacy Conagra brands, including Banquet, Healthy Choice, P.F. Chang's Reddi-wip and Sandwich Bros.","During the quarter, Refrigerated & Frozen net sales and organic net sales increased 51% and 1.5%, respectively with organic growth in both volume and price mix.","Our International segment increased net sales 5.5% in Q1 due primarily to the acquisition of Pinnacle. International organic net sales continued to benefit from growth in the snacks and frozen businesses in certain regions. However, the segment\u2019s organic net sales were down versus plan in prior year due to discrete items in our businesses in Puerto Rico and India. As Sean mentioned, these items shifted the timing of sales previously expected in Q1 to the second half. This timing shift contributed to a decrease of 3% in organic net sales during the quarter.","In our Foodservice segment, we made the strategic decision in Q1 to opt out of a lower margin contract, consistent with our value-over-volume strategy. As a result of this decision, Foodservice organic net sales declined 3.2% for the quarter. Reported net sales increased 6.3% during the quarter with the acquisition of Pinnacle adding 15.3% and the sales of Wesson and Trenton subtracting 5.8% from the net sales growth rate. We expect a stronger balance of the year performance from this Foodservice segment with new items coming to market and improved performance from Gardein.","Slide 34 outlines Pinnacle\u2019s fiscal \u201820 net sales for Q1 versus fiscal year \u201819 pro forma net sales for the same period. The 9.2% sales decline was largely in line with our expectations. As we increased brand building investments with retailers, eliminated some low-quality promotions and saw some inventory reductions with retailers in advance of implementing new shelf sets. While these dynamics led to a wider than typical difference between shipments and consumption in the quarter, we don't expect this dynamic to continue for the year to go period.","Slide 35 outlines the puts and takes of our Q1 adjusted operating margin versus the prior year. It's worth noting that the impact of the Legacy Pinnacle gross profit was a decrease to operating margin of 46 basis points during the quarter versus the prior year. Our Legacy Conagra realized productivity initiatives are progressing as planned and helping to offset inflation, which approximated 2.8% in Q1. We're also seeing a margin benefit of Pinnacle synergies in Q1, particularly in SG&A.","Slide 36 outlines the significant progress on Pinnacle synergy capture, which remains on-track in all areas: SG&A, cost of goods sold, and trade spending. We realized approximately $40 million of cost savings in the quarter, which brings total cost synergy capture to approximately $71 million since the closing of the acquisition through the first quarter. We continue to expect synergies to increase throughout fiscal \u201820. And as previously announced, we expect to achieve the majority of our $285 million in cost synergies related to the transaction by the end of fiscal \u201820.","Moving to slide 37. Conagra's total adjusted operating profit increased 40% in Q1. Our adjusted operating margin came in at 15.7%.","Each segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit benefited from the addition of Pinnacle's profit. The International segment was the only segment to see a decline in adjusted operating profit in the quarter. And that was driven by the impacts of divestitures, unfavorable FX, and the volume impact from the discrete items in the quarter.","The Grocery & Snacks segment margin decreased year-over-year. Approximately half of the margin decline was a result of the legacy technical Grocery & Snacks business being dilutive to overall segment gross margin with the rest of the decline coming from inflation and brand investment with retailers, exceeding pricing and realized productivity.","The Refrigerated & Frozen segment showed very good margin expansion in the quarter. While the Legacy Pinnacle business was slightly accretive to the segment\u2019s margins, the segment benefited from strong cost of goods sold realized productivity and synergies in the quarter.","The International segment\u2019s decline in operating margins was primarily attributed to the impact of FX, and the lower margin Pinnacle business being included in the segment. Operating margins improved for the quarter on an organic basis after excluding FX and M&A. Finally, the Foodservice business saw nice margin expansion in the quarter as it continued to execute its value-over-volume strategy.","Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our Q1 adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations versus the same period a year ago. As you can see, Conagra's adjusted EPS decreased $0.04. Approximately $0.02 of this decline were from divested businesses, and $0.02 were from a decline in the Ardent Mills joint venture. The increase in adjusted operating profit and taxes, offset the impact of increased interest expense and shares outstanding.","Slide 39 summarizes net debt and cash flow information and shows the solid progress we've made over the last four quarters to improve our balance sheet. Compared to the end of Q4 fiscal \u201819, net debt was approximately flat as we used cash on hand to fund a reduction in gross debt of approximately $150 million during the quarter. This was in line with our expectations given the quarterly seasonality of the business.","In total, I'm happy with our progress to-date. Since the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal \u201819 through the end of the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, we have reduced gross debt by over $1 billion. And with the recently announced pending divestiture of our DSD snacks business, we'll have some additional cash on hand for debt repayments after we close. As we stated, we don't need divestitures to achieve our deleveraging targets, but they can accelerate our progress.","Overall, we remain on schedule with our fiscal \u201821 target of a net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.6 to 3.5 times. As we've consistently said, we are committed to a solid investment grade credit rating. As noted in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal \u201820 guidance.","Slide 40 outlines our fiscal \u201820 outlook across all metrics. Please note that the organic sales growth rate excludes the impacts of fiscal \u201820\u2019s 53rd week. All other metrics on this slide include the impact of the 53rd week.","It is also important to note that the financial information included in our presentation today includes the expected full fiscal year results of the DSD snacks business. As disclosed earlier this month, we expect this transaction to close by the end of the calendar year as it remains subject to customary closing conditions. The expected annualized impact from this divestiture is approximately $110 million of net sales and $0.02 of adjusted EPS.","I'd also like to highlight that we continue to believe in the planning assumptions that we noted during our Q4 fiscal \u201819 call.","Overall, we see fiscal \u201820 results being more heavily weighted towards the second half. With respect to our organic net sales growth, our plan calls for higher innovation related investment with retailers during the first half of fiscal \u201820, with investment peaking in the upcoming second quarter, resulting in expected second quarter gross margin coming in below our Q1 levels.","The related sales growth is weighted towards the second half of fiscal \u201820 as our distribution, trial and repeat builds throughout the year. We expect margins to improve during the second half of fiscal \u201820. Innovation related investment will be higher in the first half, as I just mentioned. The impact of synergies will also increase as we move through the year, helping margins.","We expect Pinnacle to continue to be dilutive to our year-over-year total gross margin until we anniversary the acquisition in late October. Finally, in the second half, we will be lapping the higher levels of interest expense and share count, allowing for easier comparisons.","That concludes my remarks. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody. And thanks for the questions.","Sean Connolly","Good morning, Andrew. ","Andrew Lazar","Hey. So, first off, you talk about the -- what you see is still strong momentum in the Legacy frozen business specifically. I guess, in some of the more recent data, we've seen a little bit that both some of the -- on a sequential and sort of two-year basis, some of the trends slow a bit on again those Legacy frozen brands. I guess, what do you attribute this to? And do you expect this to perk up as fiscal 2Q progresses? And if so, what drives that?","Sean Connolly","Sure, Andrew. Let me address that. First, let me give you my perspective on our top-line trends overall. As you heard me say in my prepared remarks, top-line is tracking pretty much how we planned it with the obvious exception being International and Foodservice, which is again timing. Frozen is thriving, snacks is thriving; grocery is on track, navigating some competitive dynamics on a couple of brands, and value-over-volume is doing its thing on Pinnacle. So, one quarter down, we're on track.","Now, in Q2, we're investing meaningfully to tee up a terrific innovation slate that will support our strong second half growth. That's always been the plan, and we're excited to see it unfold. What you're seeing much more recently is a function of the fact that we are in a transitionary period at some major customers with respect to new shelf sets in frozen. And we have in fact seen some out of stocks as the new tags are being set. So, to be clear, no drop-off in consumer pull. This is a temporary dynamic; it's fairly typical in -- right in advance of the new shelf sets. And in terms of share of shelf and share of market that we're seeing in the very early days of these new shelf sets, we continue to see positive momentum. So, that bodes well.","Andrew Lazar","Great. That's really helpful on that one. So, thank you for that. And then, I guess lastly, just I wanted to zero in a little bit on the sales bridge for a moment. Specifically price mix, excluding the retailer investments, accelerated significantly from 4Q to 1Q. Retailer investment declined at a greater rate sequentially. I assume some of this is spending against the Hunt\u2019s and Chef sort of competitiveness and reflected in those retailer sort of spending investment bucket. But, maybe you could talk about that a bit. In other words, I guess, what part of retailer investments is sort of promotions on these brands, maybe versus actual brand building at the point of sale? ","Sean Connolly","I'll give you some big picture on that Andrew. And Dave, fill in any details. When we partner with our customers to drive mental and physical availability on our brands, it's kind of a holistic discussion. Again, it may involve merchandising off the shelf, it may involve pricing incentives. It's the total package. It may involve online programs, things like that. So, that's really a holistic program. But, with respect to Q1, keep in mind, we had particularly strong growth in frozen and in snacks. And part of what drives that growth is the investments that we are making with our retailers. On Hunt's and on Chef, you're really talking more of a Q2 and beyond investment, because those programs are just now hitting the marketplace as we speak. So, that's more of a Q2 and on function than what we saw Q1. Anything I missed there, Dave? ","David Marberger","Yes. Just to add, as you see on the bridge, Andrew, we invested 1.7% of organic net sales in investment in Q1. We do expect that Q2 net level will be higher. And I made that in my comments that will impact Q2 gross margins relative to Q1; and that in the second half, we expect those levels to be lower than the first half.","Operator","The next question today comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Sean, I wanted to ask about the comment that you said, we expect terrific second half growth. I appreciate the reasons why, and you laid them out well. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the distribution part of that. To what extent do you have locked in a lot of these TPD gains for especially the Birds Eye business that you talked about in the second half, or is some of it's still, hey, you\u2019re negotiating with your retailers for this shelf space?","Sean Connolly","Ken, we keep a new item tracker on every single new item we have that has our targeted ACV, our targeted TPDs, and then has our progress in terms of what has been accepted and what has not. So, we've got a roadmap. And by now, we have a pretty good handle on what has been accepted, we feel very good about it. That's a large part why we feel so good about the inflection in the back half of the year. It's really the combination of much, much easier comps on a lot of these brands, plus basically the polar opposite of what was happening last year at this time unfolding, where items were coming out that were particularly weak velocity items. Now, we've got our largest slate of innovation yet frankly across the board, not just Legacy Pinnacle and Birds Eye that is hitting the marketplace now through the back half of the year. So, feel very good about customer acceptances and the innovation slate in the back half.","Ken Goldman","And then, I guess, the philosophical question I would have as a follow-up is, you're many, many months into the Pinnacle deal now. You talked, when Pinnacle first started coming in a little bit below your expectations about some of the things that maybe prior management had done that you wouldn't have. In hindsight, is there anything substantial, anything meaningful that you and your team could have done differently or would have done differently? Any learnings from that that you might apply to any future deals that you do, just again, in hindsight with the benefit of 2020 vision?","Sean Connolly","Well, as we've passed through multiple times, after we closed on the deal, we did learn some things about the business that had to be addressed. And our approach is to address them head-on. And we are doing that. And in fact, you can look at the absolute numbers on Pinnacle in the quarter as an example and say, well, how could it be on track? And the short answer to that is, because it is. When we realized that we had to deal with some of these things on the Pinnacle portfolio head-on, we knew right then that we had to execute our value-over-volume playbook.","And keep in mind, value-over-volume is about cleaning up and strengthening the base. It may not be pretty optically when you're in the throes of it, particularly when you're in close proximity to the shelf sets and inventories adjust, which is what we saw in Q1. But, it is an absolutely critical step to improving velocities and establishing that stronger foundation on which we can build. And if you look at what we've done on Banquet on Healthy Choice and Marie and now even Wish-Bone, you've got to have the courage of your convictions to build brands the right way for long haul, and we do. So, we definitely had some things unfold on this business that we did not plan for. But, once you're at that point in time, it's really a question of how do you respond to it. And this is how we're responding to it. Not to mention the synergies that we are managing to extract from the combination are proving to be quite attractive.","Operator","The next question today comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Spillane","So, I guess, a question for me is just around, with a lot of this innovation hitting in the second half of the year, is it -- is the innovation on its own margin accretive, or are you supporting the margins, because you're going to be pulling in more synergies? So, I understand the dynamic with the slotting fees in the second quarter and that might sort of dilute margins initially. But, I was just trying to get an understanding of run rate wise how much -- what the impact of this innovation will have on margins over time?","Sean Connolly","Well, principally, we always aim for margin accretive innovations. Now, that is not always the case. We talked about spiralized as an example over the last several quarters where the Pinnacle organization previously opted out of spiralized, because it would be margin dilutive. That is a kind of an exception, when you have the consumer absolutely demanding an innovation and in the short term, it requires a dilutive gross margin profile, my position is you've got to get in the game. You can cede that beachhead to your competition.","So, there will be examples where in the short-term the margins could be dilutive. And certainly in the short-term, you've got some startup investments. We're putting a lot of the startup investments, as an example for -- which will help us in the back half into Q2. But in general, we are looking for margin accretive innovation. And quite frankly, we've been quite successful at that over the last several years. Dave, do you want to add to that?","David Marberger","And Bryan, if you look at Q1, I know it gets a little bumpy with us now having Pinnacle in there. But if you look at Refrigerated & Frozen, and you can see the margin improvement. And you can see that Birds Eye really helps with the overall margins of the segment. And so, with a lot of innovation in Birds Eye, obviously that's margin accretive. And in our snacks business, great margin there on innovation. It\u2019s hard because it's combined in a segment that has other businesses with it. So, a big part of our focus is looking at the margins whenever we launch new products.","Sean Connolly","Just one other point on that that's worth the folks on the line keeping in mind is, if you think about the Legacy Conagra portfolio, and even to some degree, the Legacy Pinnacle portfolio, it was heavily skewed toward the value -- or value tier, a value orientation. So, we have been working nonstop for five years to premiumize our Legacy CAG portfolio. We're certainly working now to premiumize the Pinnacle portfolio. And while the old school thinking is that when you add more COGS, your margin comes down, actually we\u2019ve experienced the opposite. When you build better quality products and better quality packages, you can price for it. And when you can price for it, you can build back not only your margins, but your retailer margins, which we've done. And that's one of the things that has helped our relationships with our retailers to grow progressively stronger over the years.","Operator","Next question today comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the sequential progress of Pinnacle. If I'm looking at that operating margin dilution chart correctly, it said that Pinnacle was dilutive by 10 basis points. And just using that, I get to about $90 million of operating profit for the quarter, which I think is a little bit down from the prior quarter. And then, you said, sales down 9% from prior year. So, is this really in line or was the retailer inventory reductions I guess a little more than you expected? And am I doing the math right?","Sean Connolly","Well, let me take the inventory piece, Rob. And Dave can weigh in on the balance of it. Because it is very consistent with what we expected and it's very consistent with what we've experienced before. And frankly, it's something that -- it's something that we have experienced from time to time on our broader business. So, just a broader comment on this notion of shipments vis-\u00e0-vis consumption. Again, Dave add any more detail.","I want to remind you, our business historically shows shipments and consumption track pretty closely together. But, from time to time, they will diverge. And in our case, if you see that divergence, it's likely tied to one of four factors. One is value-over-volume driven reductions in retailer inventories. And this is because when SKUs get eliminated, so do the safety stocks on those items. And it usually occurs in close proximity to shelf resets. And that's what we saw in Q1 on Pinnacle. As you saw, consumption was tracking on Pinnacle very consistently with where we've had it in that 4 to 4.5 -- down 4.5% range.","The second factor is increased brand building investments with retailers that are accounted for above the line. And in Q1, we saw that on both Pinnacle and on legacy CAG. The third occurrence where you might see the divergence is when we take deliberate actions that you can't see in the scanner data. We did this in Q1 on legacy CAG because we exited some private label products that were not the margin profile we liked. And then, the fourth factor when you\u2019d see it is declines in unmeasured channels. And we saw a bit of that in Q1 on our Duke's brand tied to the supply chain disruption we experienced in Q4 and recovering from that, but that root cause is behind us. We expect normal distribution to be in marketplace on that business in the second half.","So, we saw some divergence both in our grocery snacks business and in the Pinnacle business. It's not typical for us. But, when it happens, it\u2019s tied to those four things. And we can bridge those out. And every element of it makes sense with how we anticipate it to fold out. Importantly, we don't expect shipments to lag consumptions in the year ago period, the way they did in Q1, either on Legacy Pinnacle or our Grocery & Snacks business.","David Marberger","Yes. And just to add, Robert. When you look on the operating margin bridge, which is one of the things you're referring to, we do show that Pinnacle's 46 basis points dilutive, and that's just to demonstrate that -- and this was when we reported Pinnacle separate last year, you could see the Pinnacle gross margins are below the overall Legacy Conagra gross margin. So, by bringing that business in is to show that it's dilutive. But, what gets a little complicated now that the synergies coming in and SG&A going out, a kind of standalone Pinnacle at this point is really not relevant. We're not reporting it that way. But, that's just to show that the gross margins for Pinnacle coming in are lower than overall company average, which is what you saw at the end of last year.","Robert Moskow","So, just to follow up, Dave, this 46 basis points, does that include the benefit of the synergies or is that separate from the synergies?","David Marberger","Yes. It's a good question. It includes some benefit, the way that we actually capture a synergy and unallocated it, some of it can go to a Pinnacle item, some of it can go to Legacy CAG. Right? So, if it's in procurement and you're able to get a benefit of reducing your overall buy on a certain ingredient, it may benefit the ingredients that you use on Conagra products and Pinnacle products. Right? So, that synergy gets allocated. So, some of it\u2019s in there, but not all of it.","Operator","The next question today comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","You mentioned that brand building will be outsized in fiscal 2Q and the impact will be greater to gross margin than in the first quarter. I guess, I'm most curious about the magnitude of that increase. And just to be clear, is it largely going to be contra revenue and gross margin hit rather than a traditional advertising and consumer marketing expense?","Sean Connolly","Well, first of all, welcome back, David. Good to have you on the line. Yes. The answer is yes to your question. This is -- the way to think about this is we've got -- both in Q2, you see some Birds Eye stuff, that's recently hit the marketplace in the back half of the year, we have a ton of stuff hitting the marketplace. We've got to tee that up to get this kind of shelving we want, the eye level placement we want. Basically, all the awareness drivers have to get in place and then the trial drivers get in place. And we're doing a lot of that as we've done consistently over the last couple years in store because we find it far more effective in spotlighting our new items than running TV commercials at 3 o'clock in the morning, as an example. So, that does hit add a peak in Q2 and it is a central piece of making sure we've got that buzz out there in advance of when we expect to see the takeaway kick in, which is in the back half of the year.","David Palmer","And then, just on frozen, the frozen business, in the quarter, and I think you touched on it that the shipments were less than consumption. And perhaps that was somewhat the reshelving that's happening rather than some trade inventory dislocation, because Nestl\u00e9 shifted out of DSD into warehouse that was a little bit of a concern. So, maybe you can clarify that. And then, also, I know that when you did some of your more rapid innovation periods past, particularly when you did bowls, which were a premium offering, that was perhaps not as incremental, the shelf as you would have liked or thought as some of the retailers instead replaced some of your lower priced, older varieties. So, I'm wondering if you're making adjustments this time around to make sure you get that incremental shelf as you put out these new varieties. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","All right. So, there's a lot in there. Let me try to hit the piece there. First of all, in terms of some inventory reductions at retailers, it's really not a lot noteworthy in frozen. It was really a concept around the Legacy Pinnacle business and value-over-volume and a bit of the Grocery & Snacks business that I already talked. With respect to the shelf and the dynamics with customers right now, I would say, these are certainly very dynamic times, but our relationship with customers is very strong. And I feel very good about the progress we're making in terms of getting new items on the shelf.","Certainly creating space for new items always starts with us proactively spotlighting our own items that need to come out. That's kind of value-over-volume. And in the simplest sense, our customers want to grow and they understand that their shoppers demand modern products. And our innovation capabilities are clearly well respected with our customers as we drive growth in their priority categories of the innovation. So, they continue to embrace our innovation.","We are also working very collaboratively with many of our traditional customers though to help them navigate their exploding e-commerce business, particularly the in-store pickup piece or what some people call click and collect. And what we're doing with them there is trying to create more holding capacity within the store for top movers, think of that as high velocity items. And the reason we're doing that is to avoid out of socks, because they not only have their old foot traffic on the ground, now they've got all the people that are doing click and collect and doing pickups. So, you've got to create more holding power on those high velocity items. And that's particularly important in space constraint spaces like frozen where you would seen and we'll continue to see the actual number of TPDs coming down. But, I think, it is critically important, you don't confuse that TPD read with linear feet of shelf space being reduced, because that is not happening. In frozen single-serve meals as an example, we actually see real estate expanding. TPDs are coming down intentionally collaboratively with us and our customers. We have to have more holding power on our high velocity stuff because that leads to better sales and those are the things that really turn. But, it's a more limited assortment with more facings for big brands that have high velocities and those are brands like ours.","Operator","The next question today comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","I just had a question for you, if I could, first on this -- the drag on volume from Foodservice and International. It looks like it was about half of the volume decline, if I\u2019m calculating that properly. I don't know if you quantify that exactly, but that's what I got came out. Does the remainder of that drag then on volume -- it looks like it mostly came from the grocery division. Does that -- is that what you expect to improve in the second quarter as you think about some of those investments you\u2019re making?","Sean Connolly","Yes. The grocery piece, as I said in our prepared remarks, the decline in grocery was planned; it was highly focused on the two brands we discussed. And that is where -- we planned it that way because we didn't put the action plan in place until the very end of the quarter which really impacts Q2. And that's pretty much how it's played out. So, while it is early days on those action plans, you could see some of the numbers that we showed you today. We do like the traction we see. And those typically are very responsive brands. They are number one market share brands. When we're fully competitive, we tend to move a lot of volume. So, that's what we expect to improve as we move through Q2.","Chris Growe","And then, just to be clear on that Foodservice and International drag, does that get better in Q2 or is that more just better than -- does that continue in Q2 and better in the second half?","David Marberger","Yes, Chris. So, the biggest driver in the first quarter was the timing of sales, both in India and Puerto Rico. So, assistance programs in Puerto Rico were delayed in the quarter and that had a significant impact on our export shipments in our sales. And shipment patterns changed certain sales in India which caused timing shifts between quarters as well. So, we expect these businesses to remain on track to plan for the full year. That's just a timing push for international.","Chris Growe","So, a push into 2Q or a push into second half?","David Marberger","Year to go.","Chris Growe","Okay, got it. And a just one quick one, if I could, on the innovation costs. Are those -- is that reflected in your retailer investment category you still do in the sales breakdown? Is that what we should see some of these incremental costs coming through in Q2 for the new products?","David Marberger","Yes. So, when you talk about innovation, if you are talking about the cost to get to market and distribution, yes, you will see that above the line. There is obviously all the developmental costs of innovation, R&D and manufacturing resources and test runs and all that. And all of that hits in SG&A or cost of goods sold. But the actual distribution commercialization push with the customer is above the line.","Chris Growe","Slotting fees for example as well would be in there. Right?","David Marberger","Right.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","So, the question, Sean, one of the feedbacks I\u2019ve gotten -- received this morning is that there's a little bit of a disconnect between I guess where you guys had planned internally for sales were seem to be online as you say, and externally just having it down 1.7%. How do we think about the trajectory of the business for Q2 through the balance of the year for some of your investors who want to kind of be more aligned and familiar with what you are planning internally for how that business rebounds? Clearly, you're emphasizing the back half. But, do we see directional progress in Q2 to get halfway there, I mean, like closer to flat territory for your organic sales? Just help us understand kind of that shipment aligning versus consumption as we move through the back half.","Sean Connolly","Yes. Steve, one of the reasons why I think consensus was a little farther off with our internal plans because we don't guide to the quarter, and we're not going to guide to the quarter, but we want to be helpful in getting the shape of the curve right. And I think the message today is quarter one is on track. The back half we're counting on being big in terms of growth. And Q2 is really a quarter that sets up the back half in terms of investment, which is why Dave made the comments on gross margin that we've got, because we've got some contra gross margin and contra net sales investments hitting in Q2. So, that suggests that the real inflection that we're going to see is really coming in the back half of the year. Dave, do you want to...","David Marberger","Yes. Just to add, and here again, we don't guide quarterly. But to give a little bit more context, you should see sequential improvement in organic net sales from Q1 to Q2, and then improvement from Q2 to the second half to get to our full year outlook of 1% to 1.5%.","Steve Strycula","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Sean, for clarification, I think going back to Andrew Lazar's question and I think maybe Palmer's question, but your frozen piece of the business for Legacy Conagra, it seems like you have confidence that that is in intact. And would you say that because we see -- we're paying attention to the distribution losses and as it\u2019s tracked in Nielsen, you're saying that is kind of a -- that's a little bit misleading? Could you kind of like run through that one more time? And Dave, can you confirm on the $40 million synergies, whether that's a net or gross number? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes. So, let me try to simplify frozen. There's a lot going on right now in frozen. Dynamic times, we've got shelf sets being kind of reshuffled at major customers. Big part of that is to accommodate this whole higher holding capacity on high velocity items to support the click and collect business, which by the way, is not just a customer priority, it's our priority. Our sales look better when we've got more holding power on high velocity items. So, a lot of dynamics going on.","Within that, in space constrained spaces, you may and likely will see TPDs coming down. And I think this is important because sometimes TPDs are assumed as a proxy of real estate, and it is not an accurate proxy of real estate, where actually, as I pointed out, single-serve meals is growing in real estate, but it's -- we're getting more facings on high velocity items. So, a lot of this is happening right now as we speak. And not only I'm very pleased with leading up to those shelf planogram change with how we perform, because if you look at our data, our sales are the best in the industry, our share of shelf is the best in the industry, and no one else is even remotely close. So, that's good. And then, as we see the new planograms unfold, I continue -- even though we've had some near-term out-of-stocks in the shelf that is getting reset, I continue to see positive things in terms of our overall market shares and our overall share of shelf within the new shelf sets. So, nothing but -- it's dynamic times, but nothing has changed in terms of the consumer pull and the appeal of our brands to consumers and customers alike.","David Marberger","And Steve, to your second question, it is a net number.","Operator","The last question today comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","I guess, I'll jump off of the net synergy number. Congratulations by the way on net synergy realization, impressive uptick from the run rate you guys finished last year. Is the full year number of 130 still the right way to think about it,, given the pace you're running at right out of the gates here? And if you could remind me, is that 130 -- is that a cumulative number for the full year, or is that incremental over and above the $31 million you realized in fiscal \u201819?","David Marberger","Yes, Jason. So, let me -- let me take it from the top. We're obviously very pleased with the progress we're making with synergies. We're focused on it. We track it closely. In the first quarter, we delivered $40 million in synergies. About two-thirds of that was SG&A, which is what we expected. We're still estimating the total synergies of 285 through fiscal \u201822. One quarter under our belt still early in the year. So, we\u2019ll provide an update at the end of the second quarter on exactly where we see synergies coming in for the full year. We had said previously that we would be at 55% of total synergies by the end of fiscal \u201820. We're going to update that at the end of the second quarter as we continue to see our progress. In terms of cost to achieve, just to hit that, that's $87 million program to-date, we're still on track with the $320 million through fiscal \u201822.","Jason English","Awesome, I appreciate the incremental detail there. And then, one more, I guess sort of a multilayer question. First, the step-up in trade spend, I totally understand how that's going to our retailer market. I totally understand how that contra revenue is going to weigh on price realization in margins next quarter. But, it sounds like we should be expecting a nice little volume response on grocery. And then, we've got these international issues, which sound like they were kind of isolated. Those go away. And I imagine a lot of your activation on frozen, while you're not going to see the consumption ramp for some time, it sounds like it's been accompanied by the distribution build. So, we should at least still expect some degree of pipeline fill. So as I stack those up and I contemplate the shape of how year progresses, while organic may not really accelerate in earnest for the back half, is it fair to say we may actually see some real evidence of the uptick coming through in earnest on the volume line in the next quarter?","Sean Connolly","Well, on the volume line, you are going to see volume diverge obviously from sales, because the contra net sales items are really about setting it up. So, there will be some new items that are going to build momentum in the second quarter volumetrically. The net sales piece of it you're going to see inflect more in the back half of the year.","Jason English","Got it. Yes. So, it sounds like we will see some evidence at least building in volume, a little earlier than the back half, which would obviously be encouraging.","David Marberger","Yes. With organic, as I said, Q2, we expect to be better than Q1; and then, the second half to be better than Q2. So, that\u2019s sales but obviously with the higher investment in there. You can do the math on volume.","Sean Connolly","And part of that Jason is, the gap between shipments and consumption on Pinnacle in Q1 is -- again, that is a typical thing in close proximity to the shelf resets. Those are basically unfolding now. So, on a year-to-go basis, we don't expect to see that kind of lag. And that will begin here as we go into Q2. And that\u2019s the volume piece of it.","Jason English","Got it. So, there could be some bleed over that issue into Q2, which we should contemplate then, if it's ongoing now, fair to say?","Sean Connolly","I wouldn't say it's a straight line for the balance of the year. But, over the course of the year-to-go period, we don't expect there to be a lag between shipments and consumption.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, we refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. We delivered strong results in Q1 and are pleased with our start to the year. Before I get into the details of the quarter, let me take a step back and provide our perspective on the overall environment and how we are approaching the opportunities that lie ahead.","Roughly 2.5 years ago, we saw the need to take bold actions to address internal challenges that we faced as a company, as well as the rapidly changing dynamics in the market. We set out an aggressive plan to strengthen our foundation and build the necessary capabilities to enable us to drive growth into the future.","As we\u2019ve discussed, we took a number of actions on this front, including reenergizing our culture and organization, reducing our cost base, and rebuilding our growth capabilities to reshape ConAgra Brands into a focused, higher margin, more contemporary and ultimately higher performing company. Our goal was not only to maximize shareholder value, but also to do a better job for our consumers and our customers by way of stronger brands.","It's unmistakable that today, ConAgra is better positioned to drive value creation. Becoming a pure play branded CPG company has enabled us to zero in on the critical elements necessary to improve performance.","We've shifted our focus to value and a strategy based on renewed brand relevancy. We've been aggressive around SKU optimization, we\u2019ve become more disciplined around our A&P support and we continue to strengthen our innovation capabilities, as reflected by the new products that we are currently bringing to market.","We have a deep commitment to operating with a leaner approach, and as you have seen, our margins are far stronger. By relentlessly following the portfolio management principles we shared at our Investor Day, we've positioned the company for long-term value creation.","Now, that said, it is not lost on us that the sentiment surrounding our industry is laced with a high level of pessimism, but I can tell you that at ConAgra, we remain optimistic. As we were 2.5 years ago, we are clear eyed about the changes and challenges we see in the marketplace, but we also see this dynamic as offering opportunity.","Our optimism is grounded in our analysis of consumer behavior, which we believe provides a roadmap for what we need to do to drive growth. In fact, much of our plan is built around our view that if we study the growth pockets in our industry and then adapt our iconic brands so that they incorporate modern food benefits and attributes, we will deliver value to our consumers, our customers, and to our shareholders.","It's hard work; but the endgame is clear. In order to grow, we have to modernize, innovate, and renovate our portfolio, and that is exactly what we are doing.","Turning now to Slide 7, you can see the cadence we laid out for how our transformation would unfold. We are now in the middle innings of our journey and remain squarely on track. The last couple of years were about resetting our topline as we upgraded the quality of our revenue base. Now in fiscal '18, our goal is to further improve our topline trends as our innovation pipeline and new marketing programs take hold in the marketplace.","Meanwhile, margin expansion will continue to be a core pursuit at ConAgra. While we\u2019ve made tremendous progress, our work is not done. We still have a lot of opportunity in front of us and we will continue to chip away at margin opportunities and strengthen our innovation programs in order to improve our growth prospects.","We got off to a strong start in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was up nearly 18% from the prior year and exceeded our expectations. We continued to make progress on our margin expansion agenda, despite the higher-than-expected inflation.","I'll provide a bit more color in a moment about how we are bending the trend from a sales perspective, but we\u2019re pleased with our progress. Our sales trends continue to improve, and that improvement is accelerating. We have continued to make progress in modernizing our portfolio through strong innovation, which is performing well and through recent acquisitions.","As evidence of our conviction regarding our long-term plan and value-creation potential, we repurchased approximately nine million shares of common stock for $300 million during the first quarter.","The bottom line is that we're encouraged about our first quarter performance, and we are reiterating our 2018 guidance. We remain unwavering in our focus on driving the centerline of our profitability up over time and we are committed to continue taking the right actions to position ourselves for the future.","Turning to Slide 9; in the first quarter, we again delivered strong margin performance. In addition to the gross margin improvement I touched on a moment ago, you can see we also drove 110 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement compared to Q1 of last year.","It's important to keep in mind that because we had minimal new innovation a year ago, we had atypically low slotting investments in our base period. In first quarter of this year, we re-committed to innovation and the associated infusion of slotting back into the P&L served as a transitory headwind to our margin expansion.","The way we think about it, our unaffected gross margin expansion this quarter is plus 61 basis points, which excludes incremental slotting related to new innovation. Going forward, the incremental slotting related to new innovation will become part of the base and not have the same magnitude of impact as we continue to roll out new products. Overall, our strong margin performance continues to be enabled by the success of our value over volume strategy and the supply chain productivity work.","Turning to the top line and our progress and continuing to bend the trend in our sales performance. 2.5 years ago, we set out to improve the quality of our revenue base by cutting back on excessive promotion, rationalizing a long tail of low performing SKUs, and renovating our brands to include the attributes that today\u2019s consumers demand.","Our actions are reflected in the charts on slide 10. On the left-hand side of the slide, you can see our distribution performance, shown here as TPDs or total points of distribution, is beginning to improve. We expect these trends to shift to net gains in the back half of the year, as the pruning of low performance SKUs abates and new innovation continues to roll out.","Importantly, we have continued to increase sales velocity, as we upgraded the quality of our TPDs. When we modernize our products and discontinue weak SKUs, you can see that we are reconditioning our shoppers to purchase updated products off the shelf at full margin, and the velocities are getting better every time we look at the data. As distribution increases throughout the year, this will drive continued improvement in base dollar sales. As you can see in the chart on the right, this improvement is already materializing.","Looking now at organic net sales, our disciplined approach to resetting the top line continues to show progress, with Q1 delivering a 250-basis point increase versus fiscal 2017. Importantly, our branded domestic retail segments, where we are farthest along with our action, are performing even better.","This improvement is coming off a healthier, less promotional base business, with a greater percentage of volume coming from loyal households at higher margins. What you can't see from this chart, is that as we moved through the quarter, trends accelerated.","Our scanner data, however, does reveal this acceleration. Take a look at the last five weeks here on slide 12. On the left, you see total ConAgra domestic retail sales were down 1%, which reflects steady improvement as compared to the last 13 weeks, and the last 52 weeks.","And keep in mind, this is a period where our new products are just shipping into the marketplace. Looking at the chart on the right, you see the top line improvement is particularly dramatic in our frozen single serve meal business, which we believe is the best proxy for the traction of our plan.","As you know, our brand renovation work last year focused on frozen, given its scale and therefore represents the bulk of our new innovation this year. Early days but very promising. Overall, you can begin to get a sense for why we feel good about our growth algorithm, both this year and long term.","One of the most compelling reasons for our optimism is the strong sell-in and early success of our new innovation slate. You see a sample of these exciting new innovations on this page, most of which are shipping in the first half of the year.","The products are the result of our actions to refresh our iconic brands and are over-indexing to new, young, higher income consumers with bold, on-trend flavors. While we started rebuilding our innovation slate with our primary focus on our frozen business, you can expect to see us apply the same level of rigor and discipline across our portfolio as we go forward.","In addition to modernizing our existing brands, we have added new on-trend brands to our portfolio. This includes Frontera, where we recently applied our expertise in frozen to extend the brand into single serve meals and Wicked Kitchen, which is a millennial focused brand we\u2019ve built with wickedly bold flavors and highly innovative packaging.","In our snacks business, the integration of tenacity foods is on track and Duke's and BIGS were strong contributors to the grocery and snack segment during the quarter. The encouraging performance of these brands illustrates the value of contemporizing our portfolio through both acquisitions and in-house development to extend into faster-growing, more premium segments.","Now, I can imagine that with all of this new activity, some of you were probably thinking that was going to mean a significantly higher marketing expense in the quarter. Actually, that was not the case. As you can see from this chart, when you net slotting and A&P, our marketing spend in Q1 was roughly flat compared to year ago.","Frankly, funding our new innovation slotting costs with reductions in A&P made sense. First, we have to build distribution and awareness, then we drive trial. Therefore, in Q1, we shifted our mix to more slotting, and we expect that mix to shift back to A&P and as our new products achieve full distribution, we expect total A&P spend to increase year over year. In the first quarter, this mix shift towards slotting meant accepting a gross margin and net sales headwind, which, of course, was a non-issue for operating profit and margin.","As you probably saw, just last week, we announced the agreement to acquire Angie's Boom Chicka Pop, a leader in the fast growing better for you snacking segment, which complements our existing snack business. The $250 million transaction builds on our efforts to refresh our portfolio and accelerate growth through modernizing acquisitions. It also provides an important beachhead in the growing ready to eat popcorn category.","The Angie's team has built a tremendous business, which is on track to generate approximately $100 million in net sales by the end of calendar year 2017, which is when we expect to close the transaction. The positive energy that the brand conveys, along with the bold flavors and whole grain goodness of the product are squarely on-trend with today\u2019s consumer tastes. Given these characteristics, we think the brand is highly extendible.","As we look ahead, we will continue our two-pronged M&A strategy, focused on both smaller modernizing and larger synergistic transactions. As you have seen, we are committed to undertaking transactions that can be accretive to our margins, sales, and provide a good return.","As we look at other M&A opportunities, including larger deals, that commitment won't change. Right now, we have the organizational interest, we have the capacity, and we have the balance sheet. We are always prospecting for something that fits, is actionable, and is reasonably valued. And as you know, we will also continue to look at opportunities to exit non-strategic brands in an efficient manner using our tax asset.","I will wrap up with slide 18. In summary, we had a strong start to fiscal 2018, and are confident in our ability to build this momentum going forward. Looking ahead, executional excellence remains a key focus in everything that we do, as we are counting on our innovation to continue to perform as we move throughout the year.","As we just discussed, we'll stay active in our pursuit of value enhancing M&A and we will be relentless about doing what is necessary to deliver our long-term algorithm. With that, I will hand it over to Dave.","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I start, I want to review our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and the related joint ventures were reclassified as discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.","The commercial reporting segment only includes the historical results for the Spicetec and JM Swank businesses, which we divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability.","These items are reconciled to the closest GAAP measures and tables included in the earnings release and presentation deck. Please see the press release for additional information on our comparability items.","Moving on to our results, you can see on Slide 20, that we continue to make strong progress improving our financial profile as we reshape our portfolio. Reported net sales for the first quarter were down 4.8%, and organic net sales were down 3%, reflecting sequential improvement against our fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth rate of minus 5.5%. As a reminder, starting in fiscal 2018, organic net sales excludes the impact of FX, divestitures, and acquisitions until the anniversary date of the transaction.","Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 4% for the quarter. The decline was driven by lower volume, higher than anticipated inflation, the Spicetec and Swank divestitures, and increased slotting investment to support Q1 innovation. These were partially offset by improvements in price mix and supply chain realized productivity.","Adjusted gross margin was 29.2% in the quarter, an increase of 26 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in price mix, realized productivity, and margin accretion from the divestitures offset the impacts of slotting, inflation, and FX. Inflation came in at 4.4% of total cost of goods sold for the quarter, driven mostly by increases in proteins, peanuts, and packaging.","As you saw in the fiscal 2018 full year outlook section of our earnings release, we have updated our inflation estimate to 3.3% from 2.7%. We expect second quarter inflation to be in line with the first quarter, before it moderates in the second half to get to 3.3% for the full year.","Adjusted SG&A decreased 9.6% or $19 million in the first quarter versus a year ago, driven primarily by the timing of IT projects and lower incentive compensation expense. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 9.7%, which remains top tier in the industry.","A&P expense decreased 15.2% or $10 million in the first quarter as spending moved to later quarters to support the new product innovation after distribution. The first quarter 2018 had incremental slotting investment to support distribution. Total A&P and slotting investment taken together were approximately flat for the first quarter 2018 versus the prior year.","Adjusted operating profit was up 2.2% for the quarter, fueled by the drivers I just referenced. Adjusted operating margin continued its strong improvement, expanding 110 basis points to 16.5%, compared to the prior year. The first quarter had a higher adjusted operating margin than our full year fiscal 2018 outlook due to the timing of adjusted SG&A and A&P. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.46 for the quarter, which was up 18% and exceeded our expectations. I will discuss the drivers of this strong increase shortly.","Slide 21 outlines the drivers of our first quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Organic net sales were down 3%, driven by volume declines in grocery and snacks, international, and food service. Partially offset by volume increases in refrigerated and frozen from new products.","Price mix increased 2.3%, driven by trade efficiencies, pricing actions, and mixed benefits across all segments. As we mentioned in our fourth quarter fiscal 2017, we are implementing our value over volume strategy more aggressively in international and food service this year. The acquisition of the Frontera, Duke's, and BIGS brands in 2017 added about 170 basis points to the first quarter net sales growth rate, but notably the divestitures of Spicetec and Swank reduced growth approximately 370 basis points for quarter.","As Sean just discussed, our planned strategic approach to bending the organic sales trend is on track. Slide 22 highlights our net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. Consistent with our value over volume strategy, every segment delivered adjusted operating margin improvement during the quarter.","In our grocery and snacks segment, reported net sales were down 1.5%. The acquisitions of Frontera, Duke's, and BIGS added 3.6 percentage points to the reported net sales growth rate. Total organic net sales were down 5.1%, driven by a volume decline of 5.9%, partially offset by an 80-basis point increase in price mix. Grocery and snacks continued the planned actions to improve trade productivity and discontinue low performing SKUs.","This was particularly evident in the first month of this quarter, where we opted not to repeat deep discount merchandising events on a handful of center store brands. Accordingly, the net sales decline in the segment abated materially as the quarter progressed, continuing into the second quarter. Adjusted operating profit was $183 million for the quarter, down 1.2%, but adjusted operating margins increased 7 basis points to 24.6%.","In our refrigerated and frozen segment, reported net sales grew 1.8% and organic net sales grew 1.3% as the acquisition of Frontera added 50 basis points of growth in the quarter. Organic volume increased 1.4%, driven by new products with price mix flat as price and trade productivity increases were offset by 90 basis points of incremental slotting investment to support the new product launches. Brands that drove growth in the first quarter include iconic brands, Marie Calendar's and Healthy Choice and the new Frontera frozen business.","Adjusted operating profit in refrigerated and frozen was $102 million for the quarter, up 4.9% due to increased sales, supply chain realized productivity gain, and A&P timing, partially offset by inflation and incremental slotting expense. Refrigerated and frozen adjusted operating margin was 16.6%, up 49 basis points versus Q1 a year ago.","In our international segment, reported net sales were approximately $191 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year. This reflects a 7.7% decline in volume, partially offset by a 4.1% improvement in price mix, as the international team continues to focus on value over volume.","FX favorably impacted net sales in the first quarter by 1.6%. Adjusted operating profit was $19 million, up 29.1%, versus the prior year, and adjusted operating margin was 9.9%, up 238 basis points. The operating profit improvement was driven by favorable trade efficiency, pricing, and mix, partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume.","In our food service segment, net sales were approximately $252 million for the quarter, down 6.1%. Volume was down 17.6%, but price mix was up 11.5%, as we applied our value over volume principles and exited the low performing and non-core businesses. Adjusted operating profit was $23 million, a decrease of 1.4% versus the prior year.","Adjusted operating margin was 9.2% for the quarter, an increase of 44 basis points. Favorable price mix and SG&A savings partially offset the negative impacts of the volume declines. Adjusted corporate expenses were $29 million for the quarter, down 15%, reflecting the benefits of our SG&A reductions previously discussed.","Moving to Slide 23, this chart outlines the drivers of the 18% adjusted diluted EPS improvement in the first quarter versus a year ago. As we expected, volume declines negatively impacted EPS as we continue our value over volume strategy. This was partially offset by the adjusted gross margin improvements.","The tailwinds for gross margin in the quarter were trade efficiency, pricing and mix, and realized productivity. The headwinds for gross margin were inflation of 4.4%, slotting, and unfavorable FX.","EPS also improved from lower SG&A and A&P expense, and increased equity earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture due to favorable market conditions and continued improvements in operating efficiencies. For the remainder of fiscal 2017, we are not forecasting this level of year on year improvement for Ardent.","Interest expense drove $0.03 of EPS improve due to our lower debt, and EPS improved $0.02 from our share repurchases. The adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.9%, which reduced EPS $0.02 in the quarter, due to a lower tax rate in the prior year, driven by stock compensation deductions. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced EPS $0.01 for the quarter.","Slide 24 summarizes selected balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was $142 million for the quarter, down from 208 million for the same period a year ago, due mostly to an increase in inventory from our acquisitions and the launch of new products, along with the timing of tax payments.","We repurchased approximately 9 million shares of stock, at a cost of approximately $300 million in the first quarter. We ended Q1 with net debt of $3 billion as planned, up from $2.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2017. We remain committed to an investment grade credit rating for the business. In late May, we announced the sale of our Wesson Oil business.","As disclosed in this morning's release, we received a second request from the FTC in connection with their review of the transaction. We intend to cooperate fully with the FTC as it conducts its review.","Also disclosed in today's release, we have recently entered into an agreement to acquire Angie's Boom Chicka Pop for $250 million, net of cash acquired and a working capital adjustment. We expect to close the acquisition of this business, which is on track to generate about $100 million in annual sales, by the end of calendar year 2017.","On slide 25, we reiterate our fiscal 2018 financial outlook. We expect reported and organic net sales growth to be down 2% to flat. As mentioned earlier, organic net sales excludes the impact of FX, divestitures and acquisitions until the anniversary date of the transaction. We expect adjusted operating margin in the range of 15.9% to 16.3%.","On the Q4 fiscal 2017 earnings call, we communicated that we expected 2.7% inflation rate for fiscal 2018. We now expect the full year inflation rate to be 3.3%, and we expect the impact to be weighted towards first half of the fiscal year.","Also, we continue to expect cost savings from realized productivity to be weighted towards the second half of fiscal 2018 due to the timing of projects. We expect the effective tax rate to be 32.5% to 33.5%, and expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.84 to $1.89.","We expect to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion of shares in fiscal 2018, subject to market and other conditions, including the absence of any synergistic acquisitions. Our fiscal 2018 outlook includes the full year estimated financial results of the Wesson business, since the sale was still pending, but does not include the P&L impact of the pending Boom Chicka Pop acquisition.","In summary, ConAgra Brands continues to make excellent progress. We continue to bend the trend on organic sales. We have made great progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins and operating margins continue to grow despite increased inflationary pressures. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to pursue acquisition opportunities to drive shareowner value. Overall, we are on track and confirm our full year fiscal 2018 guidance.","Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough, and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. To provide equal opportunity to all parties, we ask that you limit your questions to one and a single follow-up. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Sean Connolly","Hey Andrew. Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning. First question would be in the refrigerated frozen space, obviously you noted positive year-over-year volume. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how you feel -- what you are thinking about the sustainability of that?","And I guess the question is, do we -- should we expect that we trade volume down a little bit and pricing up a bit as trade spend ramps down as we go forward? Or would you anticipate that sort of positive volume track to continue to go through the fiscal year?","Sean Connolly","Sure, Andrew. Let me start that and, Tom, if I miss anything, you can round it out here. I think we're just getting started on frozen. You're seeing positive results from us overall, but I think that one slide I put up was pretty important, which shows we moved into positive territory, really on the back of improved velocities.","We still have not yet turned the corner into positive territory in terms of total points of distribution. So, as I look forward and I think about maintaining positive velocities, but also linking that up with a move out of declining total points of distribution into positive net gains of total points of distribution, our results should get stronger. So, we're off to a bit of a better start than we expected. Frankly, we are just getting warmed up.","If you [indiscernible] out of the quarter and you think about the frozen section in general, as I've been saying for several years now, the entire space is ready for massive innovation and overhaul and so I think what you're seeing is the early days of the opportunity that I see in this frozen space and we feel like we're leading the way.","Andrew Lazar","All right. Thanks for that. And then that kind of leads into the next question, which is the overall, I guess renaissance we're seeing in some of the growth that's being put up in the frozen space overall.","It's true that you and the other players are obviously innovating in a bigger way. I'm trying to get a sense, do you think that\u2019s -- I don't want to say that that was easy, but, was all it took was the major players to sort of get on board with improving the quality of the food and all of that?","And it really ultimately never had anything to do with the frozen states or the temperature state, if you will, and it was just about giving, making this more relevant or is part of this -- what was recession-related for a period of time, where individual frozen meals were out of favor for families looking to -- on a budget? I'm trying to again a sense of what is leading to this renaissance a bit and again, with an eye towards the sustainability of it.","Sean Connolly","Andrew, let me -- I think this is a really important point, because our view here is that a lot of what you saw in frozen was self-inflicted. I can take that even to broader food and big food to be specific. There's been, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a lot of pessimism out there. And I think our attitude is, look, these are dynamic times, no doubt.","But, it seems to me that the notion that the sky is falling is a bit too much, isn't it? I mean, we view it as our job to navigate change in a way that sustains our competitiveness, continues to mine new opportunities and create value and we feel like we are doing that. The good news is we are two and a half years into this.","So, we\u2019re not just getting started. And the place we are farthest along is frozen. Now we have got to turn our attention and do similar things in other areas where we see growth opportunities within our portfolio, as an example, snacking where you see we have been active, particularly in M&A in the last year.","Operator","The next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thanks very much. Two from me, if I can. And I apologize if I missed this first one, but there's a lot going on this morning. Is there anything unusual in terms of comparisons with last year, investments, et cetera, that we should be aware of in the second quarter in particular?","I know you have given guidance on the first half and the timing and the cadence and all that. I just want to make sure we\u2019re not missing anything as we model this out a little bit. Because I know that some people were maybe overlooking the last quarter of the slotting fees a little bit.","Dave Marberger","Yeah, Ken, let me take that first and then, Sean, you can build on it. If you look at this quarter, Ken, and you look at our gross margin, there were a lot of moving pieces to this, right? So, if you look at our overall gross margin improvement, about 30 basis points, you had slotting, which was negative impact of about 35 basis points.","You had FX, which actually negatively impacted gross margin about 20 basis points and then you had the favorable impact of divesting Spicetec and Swank, which was about 50 basis points positive. So, if you look at those three things, they kind of net out, right? And we have now finally wrapped on the divestiture. So, to your question, Q2, that will no longer be there.","So now you are just down to in Q1, the price mix benefit on gross margin was about 130 basis points positive, but the net inflation costs was about 110 basis points of a headwind getting to our 26-basis points improvement. So, I look at that has since our inflation, we expect to be similar in Q2, that sort of relationship should move to Q2.","We still will have some incremental slotting in the second quarter, because some of our products are in Q2 as well, with our banquet products. So, there will be some incremental slotting in the second quarter as well. So, that's why we talked about the first half, there being most of the incremental slotting. So, hopefully that was able to paint a picture, but that's how I see the second quarter kind of flowing out.","Ken Goldman","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, Sean, coming out of Andrew Lazar's recent conference, I still refuse to call it anything other than back to school, Andrew, but, some people came away from their conversations with you feeling like maybe you were signaling a little bit that you are willing to take on a deal that's not necessarily accretive year one, or maybe it'll take some time to build accretion.","Maybe preparing people for a bigger deal that might cost a little more than what they thought. Is that a fair takeaway? Were people coming out of that with the right attitude? Or maybe I wasn't there, obviously. Were people misreading some of the signals you were sending?","Sean Connolly","Well, what I can tell you, Ken is I don't think I said those things but it's -- there are obviously always different interpretations of what I say. So, let me try to clarify how I think about larger M&A. We think about it, number one, in terms of does it fit strategically? Does it help us become a company that delivers stronger returns for the long haul?","And, obviously, we have to really sharpen our pencils in terms of what kind of synergies we can get, so we can understand the cadence of the returns that we can get. And then, ultimately, once we\u2019ve done those things, it comes down to is the deal reasonably valued? And is the deal actionable? And when those things fall into place, we are prepared to move.","And as you can see from our balance sheet, we have got the fire power to do something of some scale. That doesn't foreshadow specific-- any specific actions because obviously we don't have anything to report. But, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are always on the lookout for those key success criteria of ours aligning. And if we have something to report, you guys will be the first to find out.","Operator","And the next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Sean Connolly","Hi Alexia. Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So, can I ask about the drivers of the margin expansion from here? It looks as though there was a bit of slowdown on the gross margin side, which I understand was largely to do with slotting, but it is a slowdown from what we saw in fiscal '17.","Clearly the SG&A is still experiencing quite a bit of cost cutting in there as well. Can you just give us more of a qualitative description as things play out during fiscal 2018, how you expect the drivers of those margin trends to shape things? Thank you.","Dave Marberger","Sure. Let me talk about gross margins holistically for our company, because I think it's an important part of our story. We were very clear a couple of years ago that we lagged the industry materially in gross margin, where the industry was roughly at 36.","We set a 2020 goal of getting our company to 32. We are squarely on track to achieve that goal. We reiterated that guidance today. We have made tremendous progress in the last few years, putting 500 basis points or so of gross margin on there.","Back at our Investor Day, we articulated that the year-on-year progress would slow down, and for obvious reasons, but I think going forward, we have no doubt we can continue to chip away at our gross margin performance.","And when you think about the drivers of gross margin, to your question, as I have outlined previously, we actually pursue quite an array of drivers, everything from pricing, improved pricing capabilities, trade efficiency, productivity in our supply chain, channel mix, brand mix, all of these things, margin accretive innovation, all of these things are central pieces of our gross margin expansion agenda.","So, these are all things we are working. The only other thing I will make the point of, again, is that there will be some volatility in gross margin expansion quarter to quarter, based on any number of factors.","It could be that we have got more slotting in a particular quarter and less slotting in another quarter. It could be that we are in the early days of a shift from a deflationary environment into an inflationary environment.","So, we experience inflation in cogs and haven\u2019t yet gotten pricing into the marketplace. These are transitory dynamics. I don't get too caught up in those and it's why I talk about us being focused on moving the center line of our profitability north over time and trying to reduce that standard deviation around the center line by each year as we get better in terms of operating the company.","Alexia Howard","Great. And on the grocery and snacks business, the volume declines seemed to pick up again this quarter. They were a little better last time. It looks as though you are pulling back on ineffective promotional activity, which makes sense, but how do you walk the tightrope between the volume declines, the promotional activity, and profitability? Are you going to just keep current course and speed for the time being?","Sean Connolly","Yeah, let me talk about that. Dave made some important color commentary remarks in his comments earlier about this, which is that a lot of what you saw leading to that total grocery and snacks decline in the first quarter was really isolated to the first period.","And we did literally have a handful of brands in the first period where a year ago we had very aggressive deep discounting that had been long negotiated in advance with customers.","So, you may recall last year I mentioned that with some of these customer deals, you lock in up to 18 months out. So we had some of those remnant deals in there, in particular in period one, on a number of our grocery businesses we had those.","So, keep in mind, big picture, we are farther along in grocery and refrigerated. We are working aggressively now in other parts of the portfolio. Grocery is one of those. So, it makes sense for us to get these deep discount deals out of the -- out of the cadence of how we run the railroad here. It creates the wrong consumer impression about our brands.","So, you can see, in frozen, as we\u2019ve done that, we are starting to recondition the shopper to think about our brands fundamentally differently, enhanced by more modern, more premium innovation. You may not see the same level of intensity in our grocery and snack business overall.","You will see us pick our spots. But you will see us back away from some of these legacy practices still. And we did that in period one and we saw material improvements in trends after we got through period one, moving into Q2.","Operator","And the next question will be from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to come back to the uptick in inflation guidance. For the full year, it's still within the range that you can deal with using productivity, but on some of the selected commodities you mentioned.","Can you talk about the balance between offsetting that inflation through selective price increases along with positive mix and restaging? And to the extent you are having conversations with retailers about pricing in the current environment, how those are going?","Sean Connolly","Sure, Matt. Let me take that and, Dave, if I miss anything, please chime in. We are taking pricing in the current environment. We are experiencing inflation and, as you might imagine with a portfolio as diverse as ours, it does not apply equally to each and every brand.","So, if you consider peanut butter as an example, that's a product where it's obvious to everybody that the key commodity input was inflationary. We took price. Frankly, we have seen others in the category take price and the customer is aware of that as well.","So, we have been taking price. But our overall efforts to manage margin, as I just mentioned to Alexia, is more than price. It's all of those levers I just talked about. But we are taking price. We are very clear eyed with our customers about our need to do that.","And frankly, our relationship with our customers, in my judgment, since I have been here anyway, has never been better, because our customers are keenly aware that the ConAgra portfolio has a vast number of choices that offer exceedingly good value.","What our customers really wanted from us is to see these iconic brands to get into the modern era, to see better food quality, to see modern food attributes, and in many cases to see their own customer margins begin to grow again, because they have been compressed for so long as the company had so many brands that were locked into these exceedingly low-price points.","So, we have been highly aligned with our customers and, frankly, now the conversation with our customers is all about innovation. And the question we keep hearing is what's next?","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Great. Thanks, Sean. And then just on a separate topic. I mean, none of us really know if or when or how tax reform is going to happen, but just from a -- I'm sure you are going through scenario planning related to outcomes that might occur over the next 12 to 18 months.","And the big question is sort of if corporate tax rates do get lowered, how much of that do you consider taking through to the bottom line to free cash flow? How much of it gets reinvested in a more accelerated way in the P&L? I guess just any -- I know it's a bit speculative right now, but any thoughts you can share on that?","Sean Connolly","Yeah, Matt. So, obviously we have been looking at this. This week, the bipartisan proposal came out. But it's really important that we understand the details, right? More specifics around the corporate tax rate reduction, any limitations on certain deductions which would obviously impact us.","But generally speaking, I think the legislation should benefit companies that have a higher percentage of their business in the U.S., which would be us.","So, we're looking at it. In terms of if there is corporate tax reduction, and there's more cash, we bounce back to our capital allocation, right? In our balanced capital allocation, where -- what do we do with our money and we're looking at our debt. We are looking at share repurchase. We are looking at acquisitions and then investment in the organic business. So, that won't change. And we'll see how it all plays out.","Operator","Your next questions will come from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mr. Moscow, your line is open. You may be muted on your side, sir. Hearing no response, we will move on to the next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you very much for the questions. Like others, I\u2019ve got two. First, coming back to the inflation backdrop, it's edged up higher on you and quick back of the envelope math suggests it\u2019s, at these rates, it's about a 40-basis point headwind to full year operating margins. But you\u2019re holding operating margins.","So, quick question, what are the offsets? How are you successfully offsetting that more onerous inflation outlook?","Sean Connolly","Well, Jason, here again there's a lot of moving pieces here, right? So, obviously inflation ticked up. But, Sean talked about it. The one element is all the different aspects of price mix, right? So, list price increases, trade efficiency, mix, margin accretive innovation and just accelerating that and continuing to look at how that will flow out for the remainder of the year.","We did not give a specific guidance on gross margin in the year, but we did for operating margin. So that obviously, A&P and SG&A impacts that. If you look at SG&A for the first quarter, we were down about $19 million. About half of that decrease was timing and half were real decreases based on costs we had in the prior quarter.","So, we continue to look at SG&A and manage that and eliminate unnecessary costs. And we feel good about the progress there. So, when you take everything together with the pricing and how that flows out, the realized productivity that the supply chain is continuing to deliver, which is on track, and then our focus on SG&A. We still feel comfortable with the operating margin guidance.","Jason English","That's helpful. Thank you. And then the second question comes back to the grocery and snacking business. First, congratulations on refrigerated and frozen and how you successfully bent the trend there. It's encouraging to see. Is it fair to draw some parallels between the initiatives that you have effectively deployed there and the initiatives that are coming on grocery and snacks?","And if so, can you give us some color in terms of what any we may stand in, in grocery and stacks, relative to frozen. And really what I'm trying to get at is, A reason to believe you can do the same with groceries and snacks, and B; some sense of what a reasonable timing expectation to see that trend really bend on the forward.","Sean Connolly","Great question, Jason. Let me tackle that. I think the overarching thing is we don't have to do exactly the same thing in every segment that we have. We\u2019re managing a total portfolio as a single cohort and really pushing growth where it makes sense to push growth.","So, if you go back to our investor day and we talked about our portfolio segmentation model, we\u2019ve got clear growers, we\u2019ve got businesses that can move into adjacencies, we\u2019ve got iconic brands that can be reinvigorated, and we have a lot of businesses that we call reliable contributors in the portfolio.","Overall, big picture, we see lots more opportunity from here. We are innovating on our growth brands in growing categories. They skew disproportionately to frozen and refrigerated relative to, say, center store grocery. But we are also investing to bolster reliable contributors. Because reliable contributors contribute cash.","Our growth brands which are in all parts of our portfolio use more of that cash and offer more top line. So, this is a fly wheel type operation that we have got moving in the right direction and we think we can accelerate it further from here. There are growth pockets, clearly, within grocery and snacks, some in grocery, some in, clearly, obviously in our snacks business.","But there are also plenty of reliable contributors in that grocery business that are very high margin, high cash flow, and we just have not really renovated them yet and modernized them. So, that\u2019s -- We will do that.","Those businesses, some of them may not -- Chef Boyardee is an example -- we may not look at Chef as needing to become a growth engine, but it does need to reliably contribute because it's big. It's in tens of millions of households, it\u2019s high margin-high cash flow, and it provides a lot of fuel for growth both in other parts of grocery and snacks and in frozen.","Operator","And your next questions will be from David Driscoll of Citi research. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Sean Connolly","Good morning.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask a little bit more about frozen. Sean, you called it out as the piece that you really think that people should be focusing on as kind of, maybe, the early proof, in terms of your tea leaf plans and evidence and proof that things are turning.","Can you just talk a little bit more about what's going well with the innovation that's hit the market? And I say sometimes I think about it between core brands that are seeing innovation, and then flat out new brands that you are introducing to the market. And I think there's different risk profiles with these.","And then just a second related point to this, you showed five-week data that was up 6.7%, and is this the type of growth that you have expected going forward or does it get even better as the advertising kicks in?","Sean Connolly","Yeah, sure, David. Let me try to tackle that. Frozen is -- we talked earlier-- it\u2019s an opportunity and it's an opportunity and for all the reasons we discussed. And in the early success that we are seeing,","I think it's a function of the fact that these products are really good. They are clean label. They are on trend. They taste fantastic. They are in unique packaging. So, many of you got the chance to see some of this stuff at Cagney and its very impressive innovation.","But I think one of the things I'm most encouraged by in the very early data we see is the incrementality that we are seeing in some of our customers' data in terms of new purchases into the frozen section, new shoppers into the frozen section.","To me, that's the big opportunity here because if you look at millennials as an example, who historically didn\u2019t shop the frozen section. Well, think about it, millennials are living paycheck to paycheck. Perhaps one of the biggest single areas of waste in millennial budgets are the food that parishes in their refrigerator because they have been accustomed to buying refrigerated.","We can deliver the equal quality product at better prices, but frozen so it\u2019s not in a state where it\u2019s going to perish and it won't lead to a wasted household balance sheet.","So, that's a big opportunity and I think that's one of the key metrics that I want to see more of, along with the fact that we are taking legacy icon brands like Healthy Choice and we\u2019re completely changing the way they show up, so that they suddenly have strong appeal, not to Boomers but to Millennials. So, that's part of keeping brands, legacy brands fresh for the long run.","In terms of the balance between iconic legacy brand and start-up brands, as you can tell, by our portfolio, we have both and we think they both play a role. But in terms of what pays the bills, it's icon brands that have modern food attributes, that's where you drive velocity. And that frozen section in a customer\u2019s operation is a true meritocracy business.","And you have to ultimately drive velocity in order to perform and we\u2019re seeing that with the icon brands that we\u2019ve renovated. Going forward, yes, trends could strengthen from here. We\u2019ve got -- obviously we are in the trial phase now.","So as new products hit the marketplace, we will go from a trial phase to a repeat phase but we are also on a situation where we still are down in terms of net total points of distribution. So as that goes from negative territory to positive territory, that should only help.","So, we are not guiding by segment or even by sub segment with frozen single serve meals, but obviously this is going in the right direction.","David Driscoll","Thanks for the comments.","Operator","The next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So, I guess, my question is just around the sort of retailer appetite for promotional intensity and -- and even private label. We just hear that theme a lot from investors and, Sean, I guess my question is; as you have gone through the process of eliminating some of the really deep promotions and some of the highly promoted volume, have retailers reached out to try to just promote a different brand or, as you are pulling back on those promotions, are they also sort of looking to pull back on the promotional intensity in some of these categories?","Sean Connolly","Well, I -- we have received that question a number of times and I think overall, we have not been pressured to lower our prices or dial up the intensity of our promotion, and maybe that's in part because we already have so many brands that offer a tremendous value.","I think your point is right, that retailers and manufacturers alike are hungry for improved growth, and the real question is; how do you get there? Now, the default position, and a lot of people I talked to, as well, it must be lower prices but when you actually look at the data, at least within the branded space, a lot of times -- most times, it is not the lowest priced stuff that is actually growing.","It's the more premium, more innovative up to date stuff that's growing, and that's really what we are doing with our portfolio. But I think bigger overall point here is that the thing that is going to spur growth, in our mind, is innovation, which is consistent with our belief that the consumer's calculus on what drives value, and their value assessment is much more comprehensive than price alone. And the conversations we have with respect to our portfolio, with our retailers, really align with that.","Bryan Spillane","All right, thank you. And if I could sneak one more in, just related to the inflation going up a little bit. Are we now -- how much of your commodity cost exposure is locked in for the year or is there potential that it could move one way or another some more as we move through the balance of the fiscal year? Thank you.","David Marberger","Yeah, we don\u2019t -- that really varies by commodity. The area with the animal proteins where we have been impacted, that really doesn't lend itself to locking in as much. So, obviously, we buy forward, but -- so that's really where we were hit the most along with some of the packaging and Sean mentioned the peanuts.","So, we feel we have the best estimate right now, based on all the information we have and we feel good with the estimate at this time. So, Sean, anything to add?","Sean Connolly","No. I think you got it.","Operator","The next question comes will come from Akshay Jagdale of Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning, this is actually [Luby] filling in for Akshay. I wanted to just clarify your comments on your sales growth expectations. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect to see net gains in the back half of the year. Is that correct?","I wasn't sure if you were referring to the overall portfolio. And will you have fully lapped all of the SKU reductions by the second half? That's my first question.","Sean Connolly","Yes, Luby, the net gain comment was with respect to total points of distribution. So, as you think about -- and when I think about the positive net gains versus negative net gains, it's just a net of the stuff we pulled out versus the stuff we have put in. Is it net it positive territory or negative territory.","So, obviously last year, we did all takeaways out of the marketplace with SKU rationalization. In Q1, we\u2019ve had more takeaways than we\u2019ve had infusion in. And that\u2019s going to shift as you see some of our SKU rationalization work abate and you see the new products hit the marketplace.","So, you\u2019ll see those total distribution points move more towards the positive territory as we move through the second quarter and the second half.","Unidentified Analyst","That's helpful, thanks. And then I just wanted to ask a question on the Angie's acquisition. So, I think you mentioned $100 million in annual net sales. On our math, we are getting to something in the region of $7 million in EBITDA, which seems pretty low.","So, I guess, first question, is that sort of in the right ballpark? And if so, can you maybe talk about why the margins in that business might be as low as they are, and what, if anything, you guys can do to increase those? Thanks.","Dave Marberger","Well, we haven't given any profitability numbers on the business. So, I'm not sure where got. But what I can tell you is, this is an awesome brand. We can do a lot with it and we are highly confident that we will get a terrific return on our investment.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. And thanks for getting me back in. Sorry for the technical problem before.","Sean Connolly","Hey, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Hi. When I look at your Nielsen data in the past four weeks, it's in positive territory, and it gets better and better. You have provided slides just on the base sales and obviously that looks better too. But can I look at this past four-week number and assume that this is the new normal, that from an overall perspective, that you can stay positive here? I think your multiple would benefit greatly if we got comfort that this is not just a one-month kind of trend, but kind of like where you are at.","Sean Connolly","Well, clearly, it's moving in the right direction and every month is going to be different. It depends upon -- we still do have a lot of trade spend. We still do have a lot of merchandising. So, it depends upon where our activities line up vis a vis our competitive activities. But, it's moving in the right direction.","One thing that I probably should mention, as we are getting to the end of the call is some people may think that hurricanes played a big role in our P&L in the quarter. That's actually not the case. The hurricanes are really more of a Q2 concept but -- and it will impact certain brands in the week before a hurricane, and what we call the preparation stage.","But net\/net impact on our portfolio is not that significant because, if you think about it, you might build up in the preparation phase but then you've got -- you've got, perhaps pantry inventory that's got to burn down.","Furthermore, to the degree you ever have extended power outages and things like that, as you might imagine, that's not exactly helpful to frozen and refrigerated businesses. So, you have these puts and takes, is, I think, my overall point.","And there might be weekly volatility in there, but in our experience, it's not a significant net impact, really not an impact at all to speak of in Q1. And we'll see how Q2 plays out.","Robert Moskow","Just in general then, should we expect, because of that trade spend, that the reported retail sales trends are a little bit stronger than your -- than your internal kind of net sales reporting because of that slotting kind of difference?","Sean Connolly","Not really, Rob. We historically tracked -- We don't have a lot of seasonal businesses, we don\u2019t have a lot of early shipments. Our consumption, on average, tracks pretty close to our shipments. So, there's a little bit of volatility in there.","But, I think the big point you\u2019re making which I would agree with is we are seeing our plan work. And it's not surprising to me that we had this same situation when I was at Sara Lee and Hillshire and saw similar types of traction.","We are beginning to see it here. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a larger portfolio here, so we\u2019ve got more work to do in terms of touching different brands, and that takes time. This is not an overnight exercise, but there's just tremendous encouragement, I think, here on the team in terms of the traction that we're seeing.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Brian Kearney for his closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","Thank you.

This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan and I will be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today\u2019s program, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; John Gehring, Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Klinefelter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Klinefelter.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today\u2019s remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements and while we are making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company\u2019s direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that can influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I will refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, our Q&A document or on our website.","Now, I will turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Chris. Happy holidays, everybody and thanks for joining us to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings. As you saw in our release, our second quarter results reflect continued momentum following a strong first quarter with comparable EPS of $0.71, up from $0.61 in prior year.","Before I get into details regarding our results, I want to take a step back and review the broader set of strategic initiatives we have undertaken to build a stronger, more consistent and more valuable future for ConAgra Foods. In the three short months since we met to speak about our first quarter fiscal 2016 results, we have undertaken bold actions that demonstrate our commitment to creating significant value for our shareholders. Specifically, we announced a $300 million efficiency plan with $200 million coming from SG&A reductions and $100 million from trade efficiencies. The decision to co-locate our entire Consumer Foods team under one roof in a new corporate headquarters in Chicago, the agreement to sell our private label operations to TreeHouse Foods and plans to separate into two independent pure-play public companies, ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston. We are hard at work implementing each of these initiatives. We are on track to execute our $300 million efficiency plan, which will truly help us build ConAgra into a lean, more focused company and we are confident this effort will improve profitability, advance our growth agenda and unlock shareholder value.","As we said previously, we expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. Work is also underway to bring our consumer team under one roof at our new headquarters in Chicago. We expect to move during the summer of 2016 and we are confident that bringing the consumer and corporate leadership teams together in a more open physical space will accelerate our shift to a leaner, more nimble, innovative and performance-oriented culture. Importantly, we also expect to improve our ability to attract and retain top talent. Ultimately, our goal is clear. We are building a ConAgra that is sharply focused on the consumer in a tireless pursuit of profitable growth. With respect to private brands, in early November following a robust process, we announced the sale to TreeHouse Foods for approximately $2.7 billion in cash. We remain on track to close the transaction in the first quarter of calendar year 2016.","Finally, just last month, we announced our plans to pursue the separation of ConAgra Foods into two independent public companies, ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston, through a tax-free spin-off, which we expect to complete by fall of calendar 2016. As we said when we announced the spin-off, our goal is to enable both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston to operate as vibrant pure-play companies with enhanced strategic focus and flexibility. We believe this is the best opportunity for these businesses to drive solid, long-term financial performance. Both companies will have strong market positions and will be poised to capitalize on their unique growth opportunities.","As we get closer to the spin, we will share additional details regarding each business and our expectations for their respective performance at two separate Investor Days. So, we have accomplished a tremendous amount in a short period as we transformed ConAgra Foods to unlock long-term shareholder value. While a significant amount of work lies ahead on each of these initiatives, I can assure you that our management team is fully committed to executing with excellence. At the same time, we remain intensely focused on the operational plan that I laid out in June. Everyday, our business teams are and will remain focused on: one, driving margins through efficiencies; two, disciplined portfolio segmentation, brand building and innovation; and three, balanced capital allocation. Our solid Q2 results provide direct evidence of the progress we are making against these efforts. We have a good foundation in place and we are seeing positive trends in both Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods.","In our Consumer Foods segment, we reported second quarter net sales of approximately $2 billion. This is down versus the prior year as a 2% improvement in price mix only partially offset a 3% decline in volume and a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange. In terms of profitability our commitment to improving our fundamentals led to a robust 10% increase and comparable operating profit and margin expansion of more than 200 basis points. This overall profile of margin expansion, alongside a disciplined pursuit of higher quality volume, will be a central part of our playbook in 2016 as we focus on maximizing our profitability over the long-term.","Along these lines in Q2, we benefited from strategic pricing actions and reduced inefficient trade investments on key brands in order to begin establishing more of an investment grade volume base. Additionally, we made strategic investments in marketing to help drive long-term brand vitality. So again, our approach to the top line right now is one of increased discipline around portfolio segmentation, assortment, trade, pricing, innovation and A&P support aimed at driving higher margins and unlocking new channel opportunities. And as I have said before that means we are gradually eliminating volume that does not meet our profit standards. We will continue to follow this approach in coming quarters as we strengthen our foundation and create a platform, which we can grow in a quality way. One brand that demonstrates our intentions perfectly is Banquet, and I will say more about that brand in a minute.","We also have a number of other brands that are performing well and delivering solid top and bottom line growth in response to investment. These are brands with clear differentiators and relevant consumer benefits like Marie Callender\u2019s, Slim Jim and Reddi-wip. Our investments here are driving strong end market results as these brands grew significantly during the quarter.","Looking ahead, we believe we have further opportunity to refresh our Consumer Foods portfolio in a number of ways, including further premiumization and an enhanced focus on wellness and authenticity. We expect to achieve this through a combination of organic innovation and marketing as well as smart acquisitions. You can see examples of this kind of work in our portfolio right now. We have launched Healthy Choice Simply Steamers, a clean label, lower carb version of our successful frozen Caf\u00e9 Steamers line. We also launched Peter Pan Simply Ground, which is one heck of a product.","And as you have heard us discuss before, within Hunt\u2019s, we have leveraged our flash steamed peeling process that naturally peels tomatoes with steam. On Reddi-wip, with the emphasis on using real cream versus oil and on Hebrew National where our all-beef hot dogs are free of fillers, byproducts and artificial colors and flavors. And complementing our organic innovation recently was the acquisition of Blake\u2019s All Natural Foods. While small, it\u2019s a good example of how we also aim to refresh the portfolio through new additions.","I mentioned earlier that Banquet demonstrated our margin over volume intentions perfectly and now I would like to offer more color. In fact, Banquet represented the vast majority of the second quarter volume decline as planned. Nevertheless, we believe our plan is the right one for long-term brand health and financial strength. In the second quarter, we launched a comprehensive program to restage the Banquet franchise and liberate it from the $1 price point. The higher price points enable us to invest in higher quality, including more protein as well as in surgical A&P that reeducates the consumer about the brand. As expected, we experienced an elasticity effect on consumer demand tied to the new pricing and reduced trade promotion frequency. But we also launched a new consumer marketing campaign late in the quarter to introduce consumers to Banquet\u2019s new value proposition. Not every consumer will transition with the brand because a few are only about price, but given the higher quality we will attract new consumers to the franchise over time as well as improve the buying rate of brand loyalists. While it\u2019s still early in the rollout, we like the margin expansion we are seeing and its highly disciplined approach to margin expansion is one we feel good about and we will methodically apply to other brands with similar opportunities.","The final point I will make about our Consumer Foods segment is that we will remain relentlessly focused on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs to provide the necessary resources to invest behind organic and inorganic growth initiatives as well as the price mix benefits that come from our disciplined portfolio segmentation. Those initiatives should make for solid, consistent profit performance this fiscal year. Turning to Commercial Foods, net sales were approximately $1 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year. The Commercial Foods segment\u2019s operating profit was $162 million, up 11% on a comparable basis. Lamb Weston delivered strong international volume growth. As you know, this is due in part to lapping the impact of last year\u2019s West Coast port labor dispute as well as the impact of last year\u2019s food safety issues in Asia.","We are now seeing our international shipments normalized and growing in key markets. As we have indicated before, Lamb Weston remains well positioned to capitalize on the significant international growth opportunities created by the aggressive emerging market expansion of major quick service restaurant chains. We have and we will continue to invest in this business to support our customers\u2019 growth internationally. In our Lamb Weston North America business we continue to see positive growth momentum across many of our key customers in the quick serve restaurant and operator distributor channels. We have industry-leading innovation and customer service and our breadth of diversified products continue to position this business as a clear market leader in North America.","As we mentioned before, private brands has been reclassified as discontinued operations. At a high level, I will say that the team continues to make progress on stabilizing the business and making sequential improvement in profitability. We look forward to completing the transaction in the first quarter of calendar year 2016 and are working closely with TreeHouse Foods to ensure a smooth transition for all stakeholders. Before I turn it over to John, I want to take a moment to recognize the significant effort of our team across the company as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent company with a more valuable future as we unlock shareholder value. Yes, we have got a lot of work to do, but I am confident we are on the right path and couldn\u2019t be more excited about what lies ahead.","With that, John, over to you.","John Gehring","Thank you, Sean and good morning and happy holidays to everyone. In my comments this morning I will recap our fiscal second quarter performance including comparability matters and then address cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. I will also provide some brief comments on our fiscal 2016 outlook. Before I comment on performance, I want to briefly update you on the divestiture of our private label operations. As Sean noted, we continue to expect to close the sale in the first calendar quarter of 2016. At this time, we have only recognized a small portion of the tax benefit related to the capital loss we expect from the sale. However, we remain confident that the company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future. Specifically, we expect to utilize this loss carry-forward over the next few years as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner. As a reminder, the results of operations for the businesses being divested are reflected in discontinued operations for all periods presented. In addition, in accordance with GAAP, the company is no longer recording depreciation and amortization expense on the assets held for sale.","Consistent with our second quarter guidance, discontinued operations for the fiscal second quarter reflect about $0.07 of EPS benefit from the absence of depreciation and amortization. And as I noted last quarter, there are several smaller lines of businesses \u2013 business that have been reclassified between segments in connection with the private brands divestiture. The overall impact to our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments is minor. However, we will provide reclassified historical segment financial information as part of our third quarter earnings release.","Now I will recap our performance for our fiscal second quarter. Overall, diluted EPS from continuing operations as reported was $0.37. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, diluted comparable EPS for the fiscal second quarter, including discontinued operations, was $0.71 which is ahead of our expectations and compares favorably to our prior year quarter\u2019s comparable earnings per share base of $0.61. As Sean noted, both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments performed well. In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $2 billion for the quarter, down about 3% from the year ago period, reflecting a 3% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price mix and a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange.","Segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $341 million or up about 10% from the year ago period. Operating margin on a comparable basis expanded about 200 basis points versus the year ago quarter. Margin expansion continues to be driven by pricing, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and favorable commodity trends. Foreign exchange this quarter had negative impacts of $32 million on net sales and about $12 million on operating profit for the segment. Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results. This quarter cost savings were approximately $40 million and inflation had a modest favorable impact on results this quarter. On marketing, Consumer Foods\u2019 advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $105 million, up about 18% from the prior year quarter reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or up about 2% from the prior year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment\u2019s operating profit was $162 million or 11% above the year ago quarter\u2019s operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability. The strong operating performance was driven by margin expansion and strong volume performance in our Lamb Weston business. Discontinued operations posted a loss of $0.02 per diluted share this quarter, which includes an impairment charge of approximately $0.18 per share. This charge was required to adjust the carrying value of the private brand\u2019s asset held for sale to $2.7 billion, which is our expected net proceeds from the pending transaction. After adjusting for this charge and other expenses, the private label discontinued operations earned $0.13 per diluted share this quarter, including about $0.07 per share of benefit related to the cessation of depreciation and amortization. Expected comparable earnings from private label operations were included in our earlier guidance for the quarter.","Moving on to corporate expenses for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $190 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $65 million versus $57 million in the year ago quarter. The increase versus last year\u2019s second quarter principally relates to higher incentives. Equity method investment earnings were $25 million for the quarter and $34 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture driven by unfavorable weak market conditions, which from time to time can result in short-term margin impacts.","Our comparability items this quarter included three items. First, approximately $0.19 per share of net expense related to restructuring charges. Second, approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to the income tax matters from the planned sale of the private brands business. And third we had approximately $0.15 per share of expense related to items and discontinued operations for which we have provided additional details in the Regulation G disclosure included in the release.","On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $96 million of cash on hand and $167 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total operating cash flows through the second quarter were approximately $318 million versus $418 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease is driven principally by timing matters related to incentives and tax payments. And as a reminder, due to the seasonality in our business and our normal inventory cycle, we typically generate a significant portion of our annual operating cash flow in the second half of the year.","We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive operating cash flows over the balance of this fiscal year. On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $69 million versus $67 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $80 million in the fiscal second quarter versus $79 million in the year ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $108 million versus $106 million in the year ago quarter. On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy that appropriately balances between further debt reduction, the top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments.","During the second fiscal quarter, we repaid $250 million of long-term debt principally through commercial paper borrowings. We expect to refinance $750 million of debt, which matures on January 25, 2016 with short-term debt in commercial paper. As previously noted, we plan to use the proceeds from the sale of the private label operations primarily for debt repayment, including any debt issued to refinance the January debt maturity. During the fiscal second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.","Now, I would like to provide a few comments on the balance of fiscal 2016. As we noted in the release, we are not offering fiscal 2016 EPS guidance at this point given the current status of the private brands divestiture. However, I would like to offer a few comments on our outlook. In our Consumer Foods segment, we expect to post modest comparable operating profit growth for the full fiscal year, even with our higher marketing investment, one less week in the year and headwinds from FX and higher incentives and stranded costs. The improved performance reflects margin expansion driven by pricing, mix management, supply chain efficiencies and a favorable commodity environment. We also expect the Commercial Foods segment to post solid operating profit growth despite having one less week in the year and higher incentive costs. The profit growth reflects volume growth in Lamb Weston and margin expansion across the segment.","With regard to the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect comparable EPS, including discontinued operations to be modestly higher than the prior year quarter. Our guidance assumes expected headwinds from higher incentives, FX and increased marketing investments. This guidance also assumes a full quarter\u2019s contribution from the private label business and reflects the benefit from the cessation of depreciation and amortization related to the private label divestiture. We expect continued strong fundamentals in both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segment with margin expansion across those segments and continued strong volume performance in our Commercial Foods segment. We also expect modest initial benefits from our SG&A cost savings programs.","In closing, while we are working through a great deal of change, we are pleased with our performance so far this fiscal year and strengthening margins across our businesses and in managing the significant changes in cost structure and portfolio that we believe will drive value creation over time. That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner will be happy to take your questions.","I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody and happy holidays.","Sean Connolly","Good morning, Andrew.","John Gehring","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, John. Just two questions from me if I could. First would be just around the efficiency projects and this maybe just splitting hairs, but I guess you talked about in the release this morning about getting the full $300 million in savings by the end of fiscal \u201819. And I think in the prior release when you had announced these projects, I think you said maybe roughly half in \u201817 with the balance in \u201818. So, I didn\u2019t know if there was something that had changed that, that pushed it out by year or if it\u2019s I am just making more of the wording than I should?","John Gehring","Yes. And probably, some imprecise wording on our part, but we would expect as I said in my comments we will have some modest benefits in fiscal \u201816. We will have a significant portion of the savings in \u201817. And by the time we get to the end of fiscal \u201818, we will be at our full run-rate of cost savings, so, really no difference \u2013 no change in our outlook from the previous call.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thanks for the clarity there. And then just want to make sure a little bit understanding of the guidance for fiscal 3Q. Given you are including private brands for the entire three months of the quarter, I guess given the D&A benefit to the private label results is likely to again be sizable in the 3Q. I guess it would sit I guess by back of the envelope would suggest it implies maybe the underlying operations maybe flat to down in 3Q. But given the strong performance this quarter, I am trying to understand what would really drive that or what\u2019s different around the underlying business in the 3Q than what we saw in 2Q? ","John Gehring","Yes. Andrew, I think your assessment of flat to down modestly, the way the math works is how we are looking at it right now. I would say we still expect to see good fundamentals across both of the operating segments. Commercial I think will continue to see good volume growth in margin expansion. In consumer, we expect to see continued strong gross margins. However, we also are reflected in that guidance. We also expect to continue to invest responsibly behind our brands and we will have some additional pressure from FX and higher incentives. So, I think the trends that we have seen in the strong segment performance will continue.","Sean Connolly","Yes, Andrew, it\u2019s Sean here. If I can just build on that, clearly, the actions we are taking overall as a company right now are aimed at maximizing our value creation potential for the long-term. So, principally, the way I think about this is that the absence of D&A gives us some flexibility to make strategic investments for the long-term health of our portfolio. And importantly, that\u2019s an approach that we will follow in the future fairly consistently where if things break our way, we will invest some of that favorability back in our business. And similarly, when things break against us, we won\u2019t completely abandon brand building and innovation entirely. It\u2019s all about maximizing long term profitability.","Operator","And we will move now to Citi\u2019s David Driscoll.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Sean Connolly","Good morning, David.","John Gehring","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","So, I just wanted to ask a couple of things about cost savings and inflation. I think you said that you generated about $40 million of cost savings in the quarter. How do we think about this figure going forward, John? Should it be is $40 million a quarter a good number? And then would this number be something on top of the $300 million that really starts, I guess, you said a little bit this year, but really big-time starting next year. This $40 million just kind of normal productivity and shouldn\u2019t be repeatable on top of the $300 million going forward?","John Gehring","Yes, so really two separate line items there, David. The $300 million is our cost savings that we talked about a month or so ago. That is comprised of about $200 million of SG&A, about $100 million of trade efficiency. The $40 million I referenced was just the Consumer Foods supply chain, COGS efficiencies that we have achieved and I would say we certainly would look to perform at that level. I know we are going to challenge our business to make that even stronger over time, but that\u2019s probably a decent model to work with.","David Driscoll","And then just clearly on that \u2013 thank you, thank you for that. Just following on, on the inflation piece, you mentioned that inflation was a benefit in the quarter. Can you give us some kind of quantification on it? And then importantly, do you expect that level of inflation benefit to persist in the third and fourth quarters of the year?","John Gehring","It\u2019s probably in the range in $0.01 or so, maybe $0.01 to $0.02 of benefit. I can\u2019t get into the details in terms of looking forward. Clearly, the commodity markets have been favorable, I think almost across the board. However, as we look at there are some challenges from time to time in manufacturing and transportation particularly in terms of capacity and the transportation and warehousing area. But I think overall, we would expect inflation to be net-net a minor impact or benefit going forward for the balance of the year.","Operator","And we will take a question now from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thanks and happy holidays from me as well.","Sean Connolly","Good morning Ken.","Ken Goldman","In terms of the gross margins strength, I think you highlighted a couple of items and I think in there and correct me if I am wrong, reduction in trade spending in an effective way, some SKU rationalization. Two questions behind that, number one, if we were to bucket those two items in terms of sort of their importance in the gross margins strength, how would we think about that and also is there other writings that perhaps are beyond that \u2013 those two as well that helped the gross margin. And I know you talked about cost deflation, so I guess that\u2019s the third. And then I guess the second question on that is are you getting any pushback from your customers as you spend a little bit less on trade, I mean I guess a lot of it has to do with Banquet. But just in general, some of the grocers that we cover talk about the balance they would like to have between promotion and non-promotion, but that they can\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t just want their vendors to cut it all off and leave it dry, so I am just curious how you think about that balance there and when there has been any push-backs from your top customers out there?","Sean Connolly","Yes. Ken, Sean here. When it comes to gross margin expansion, what we are really relying on our own actions and improvements in our own level of discipline, not windfall benefits from the market and from deflation, that\u2019s not what this is all about. It is a multifaceted approach that we will continuously we take here in the quarters and years ahead to get our gross margins up. And a big piece of that is discipline around pricing trade efficiency, etcetera. But as we think about pricing, there are three pillars to our pricing actions. The first is what I will call inflation justified list price increases. The second is less deep discounting in terms of trade investments. And the third is brand quality upgrades like we did with Banquet this quarter. At any given time, we are pursuing some combination of these three and the goal is simple, which is to maximize brand strength and in doing so, maximize margins. Clearly, our efforts here are in early innings, but we feel very good about what we can do on the margin front and what we can do on the brand vitality front over time. With respect to your question on trade, we are a company that has historically, obviously lean too hard on trade and a lot of that was without a lot of discipline and we didn\u2019t get a good return on that investment. That\u2019s not in our customer\u2019s best interest either to spend money with them that doesn\u2019t generate top and bottom line sales. So when it comes to trade in $100 million we talk about, we talked about this before, but it\u2019s not about cutting that $100 million, it\u2019s about identifying where $100 million is not generating a return and then redeploying that. We might redeploy it in more efficient promotions. We might redeploy it in innovation, etcetera. At the end of the day, our customer wants to grow their top line and bottom line as much as we do. And if we cannot identify dollars that we are spending with them that are not working efficiently and make the more effective and more efficient, they are fully supportive.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","We will take a question now from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning everyone and happy holidays as well.","Sean Connolly","Thank you.","Matthew Grainger","So I guess first, just to follow-up on Ken\u2019s question, I wanted to see if you could provide any more granularity on some of the promotional adjustments and SKU rationalization that\u2019s going on in consumer and clearly a bulk of it right now is your focus on restaging Banquet, but I am just curious where you are in the process of assessing other brands acting on opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. And in terms of the impact, any directional commentary you can give on how that might impact the top line in the second half or how much its benefiting margins at the moment?","Tom McGough","Sure, Matthew. This is Tom McGough. Let me build off the comments that Sean highlighted. In terms of \u2013 I think we have talked about pretty consistently about making sure that each of our businesses is right on the four piece, improving the fundamental, being perfect at retail. If you look at a business like P.F. Chang\u2019s this time last year when we reinstates that business in terms of product quality, product range and the business has grown very nicely. So our approach is one looking at our businesses and assessing the performance against those dimensions and Banquet is a move that we are making this year. We are combining our pricing increase with the significant increase in the product quality. This is a brand that has nearly 50% household penetration. It\u2019s a relatively high purchase frequency business. We don\u2019t expect all those customers or consumers to come with us with a higher price, but we are investing in the business to advertise the new benefits and features that we have added to the product. And over time, we believe that that\u2019s the right long-term approach to strengthen the fundamentals on the business. In terms of trade productivity, as Sean said this is not a take away. This is about how are we more effective. And our experience has been that customers want to have higher impact, higher ROI and that\u2019s our focus. So it\u2019s part of our new discipline that we have across our company, getting the fundamentals right and looking at how we invest our resources for the highest impact of return both for ourselves and our customers.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks Tom. And then just one follow-up, I guess on the Consumer Foods top line growth profile, underlying sales growth in that segment has been a bit ahead of retail takeaway, I guess as implied by scanner [ph] data for the past two quarters and I know there is \u2013 some thing is going on with the adjustments in trade spending, but as we look ahead to Q3, can you just update us on where you stand on inventory levels at the moment, whether there has been any shipment timing dynamics around the Banquet restaging or anything that would have flatter results in the quarter?","Tom McGough","So, our scanner performance is only a \u2013 it\u2019s a significant portion, but only a portion of our overall results. There are non-measured channels, in particular club dollar that our portfolio is well positioned against. In terms of retailer inventories, we actually come in the industry see a trend among retailers to be more efficient. So, there is no real significant changes in any type of retail inventory. So as I look at the second half, we are going to continue to take a very strategic and disciplined approach to building a stronger and healthier volume base and our second half volumes likely to be down slightly as we continue to focus on eliminating that non-investment grade volume that John spoke about.","Operator","And David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets has our next question.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning, happy holidays. Just to follow-up on that trade promotion line of questioning, if you were to look at the volumes side, it looks like mid single-digit declines in Nielsen takeaway, how much do you think that decline is being caused by that purposeful reduction in promoted business or even SKU rationalization. And then perhaps separately, it looks like the cocoa business is coming off, I would imagine you are seeing weather noise there, any help on that would be great? Thanks.","Tom McGough","Sure. Once again, this is Tom McGough. Let me just set the context of the overall sales performance. As both John and Sean talked about, our sales performance was largely defined by Banquet and FX. In terms of the balance of the portfolio, we feel really good that we have improved our overall competitive effectiveness. While there is puts and takes across the balance of the portfolio, in aggregate we grew sales and share across the rest of our business and that\u2019s a multi-dimensional. It is increasing investments behind consistent high-performing brands like Marie Callender, Slim Jim and Reddi-wip. They also contribute to a significant mix improvement. We are taking inflation justified pricing. Most of that is rollover pricing from earlier in the year and we continue to work brand by brand to optimize the four piece. Part of that is looking at the trade promotion effectiveness. And another component is the SKU optimization where we have actually seen as we have eliminated SKUs, our velocities increase and the strength of our business is stronger. As you mentioned there are some near-term headwinds, particularly we see a slow start to the winter season. Our focus however, is really focused on what can we control and what we can control is our competitive effectiveness. And for the vast majority of our portfolio, we grew sales and share during the quarter.","Operator","We will move now to Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just a couple of questions. Follow-up on some of the earlier promo efficiency discussion, how much did your largest customers\u2019 clean store initiative itself maybe drive some of this reduction in promo, but then I have one question after that?","Tom McGough","This is Tom again. Across our customer base, our customers are each refining their strategies and tactics to improve their overall competitiveness. We are fully engaged with each of our customers to better align our initiatives, our strategies, our tactics with their go-to-market. I think that\u2019s the new reality that we are going to face. And in that, what I feel good about is that we are increasing our overall share in the large portion of our portfolio. We seem to have a business that\u2019s driven more by consumer poll than customer push. So, those are just the dynamics that are happening within our business. We are taking a very disciplined approach to our investments and always trying to figure out the best way that our program is aligned with our customer\u2019s interest so that we mutually grow our businesses.","Jonathan Feeney","So from those comments, Tom, it sounds like a clean store initiative broadly speaking would align kind of things you want to do with your portfolio anyway?","Tom McGough","I would make within our industry, it\u2019s a relatively modest growth industry, and it is one about improving the operational efficiencies of the business. And those are the activities that we are focused on. We think they are the best interest of our brands, and ultimately, it\u2019s where our customers are going as well.","Sean Connolly","And just Jonathan, it\u2019s Sean here. One of the things \u2013 one of the places we are trying to get to is a place of more consistency for our shareholders so they can understand kind of the demand pull. And when historically we would drive these kind of artificial spikes of volume because of deep discount promotion, then you got to wrap it the following year, gets more costly every year, it\u2019s just not a good way to run the business. It creates too much volatility. It eats away too much margin. That\u2019s the opposite of what we are trying to get to, because obviously you take some time to kind of get off the drug so to speak and change your behavior, but I am really pleased with the progress Tom and his team are making here, because discipline goes a long way on this front.","Operator","We will hear a question now from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones. First, I guess in terms of the potential for some of the debt refinancing coming up and debt pay down. Is there \u2013 John, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of whether there is going to be any sort of like cash costs or any other additional cost related to like prepayment, any kind of penalties or just cost associated with paying debt down early?","John Gehring","So, I am not going to go into details of our debt repayment plan, but certainly, depending on how we affect that debt repayment, there could be some premiums we pay to get \u2013 to repay some of the debt. We have not finalized all those plans. So, I can\u2019t dimensionalize that for you. But what I can tell you is I am confident that whatever we do there, I think will be a pretty prudent use of the cash proceeds in a way that will benefit our balance sheet and then also balance that with reducing our interest cost over time.","Operator","And we have a question now from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman","Hi, good morning. Happy holidays again. I have two questions. First, Sean, maybe can you talk a little bit about the kind of landscape for Lamb Weston and like sometimes in the past like the potato crop has kind of hurt results. And we don\u2019t have a lot of visibility into that and just maybe kind of how some of the QSR trends are affecting the outlook? And then on the \u2013 maybe you could talk a little bit on the consumer side about just the frozen category as you know has been really challenged since the financial crisis? Are you seeing any kind of flat-lining or maybe even some growth in the mainstream parts of that category? And I will let go.","Sean Connolly","Let me come back and tell you how I am thinking about frozen, Eric. I am going to turning it over to Tom Werner, so we can give you a little bit of perspective on the crop and on Lamb.","Tom Werner","Thanks. Hi, Eric. This is Tom Werner. First part of your question, we are at a point of the year where our crops in the storage so to speak and we feel really good about the crop and how it\u2019s going to perform in our factories this year. So, we are not expecting any crop related financial issues for this fiscal year. The second part of your question, the QSRs, how are they doing? I would say when you look at North America and our international QSR customers we are seeing pretty solid year-over-year growth as we indicated. So, we feel really good about the trends that are happening particularly in North America, where we are seeing an uptick in traffic and that\u2019s certainly being reflected in our results.","Sean Connolly","Yes. And just a few thoughts on frozen, Eric, because this comes up every quarter and I think what\u2019s fascinating to me about frozen is you really need to peel back the onion and look very specifically category by category and then within category to see what\u2019s going on, because you are going to see completely different trend lines in different parts of the business. I think the first big picture point on frozen is the consumer need state for frozen food is absolutely undeniable. If you look at income levels in this country, cash flows in this country and the perishability associated with fresh foods and the fact that people have need states most often during the week and frankly it\u2019s the majority of occasions where they are eating by themselves off major kind of breakfast, lunch and dinner hours. The ability to have frozen food that stays ready when you are on hand is absolutely undeniable. What\u2019s fascinating about when you peel back the onion and look at it is far and away the largest piece of the weakness within the frozen section is stuff that I will describe as diet foods. Brands that have historically had trademarks and positioning that were associated with weight loss. And they wore that weight loss diet positioning on their sleeve. Those are the products that disproportionately have struggled and have struggled for some time.","I think companies are refocusing on quality and they are refocusing on what the definition of wellness means and for kind of a whole new generation, including us. So, if you look at our Healthy Choice franchise as an example, it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. We have got in the last few years a major thrust away from the old what I will call kind of ice cube tray type of frozen dinners that have been around forever and into a much more innovative product that we brand as Caf\u00e9 Steamers. So, we have actually migrated away from the historic Healthy Choice positioning, focused more on Caf\u00e9 Steamers, more on fresh. And then in this fiscal year so far, we built on that by launching the Caf\u00e9 Steamers Simply line, which is all about clean label, low carb, much more contemporary. And these kinds of offerings are not only getting disproportionate customer support in terms of real state, because customers are dying for growth in frozen, but their velocities are significantly better and their margins are better. So, there is going to be a migration that takes place here and we want to participate in that and that\u2019s why we think innovation is going to be central to getting the frozen section operating to its full potential.","Operator","We will move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone and happy holidays.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. You alluded to inorganic growth and maybe portfolio changes in the Consumer Foods segment, could you maybe talk about your aspirations for acquisitions in there? What kind of properties might you be thinking about, small, large, fast growth, focusing on cost savings? And would you anticipate any further divestments out of your Consumer Foods business? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Sure. Let me tackle that, Alexia. What I have said in previous quarters I think remains absolutely true, which is this is in the macro we are reshaping this portfolio and it\u2019s going to happen organically and it will happen inorganically. On the inorganic side, frankly, including the organic side, the places where we have got to bolster up our portfolio is more along the lines of clean label, natural, organic, more along the lines of premium gourmet. That will be both organic and inorganic. You already see stuff like that going on. Organically, you see things like Blake\u2019s coming into the portfolio. So, we will be looking for those things. They tend to be faster growing. They tend to be margin accretive. The key is you got to be disciplined in your pursuit of that. So, we are very clear eyed on the strategy. We will be equally clear eyed on the economics of these deals. And with respect to small, medium or large, I won\u2019t speculate on small, medium or large other than to say we got plenty on our plate right now organically. So, we are going to continue to look inorganically, but it\u2019s not as if that\u2019s a pressing need to do something of significant magnitude there.","And as you think about divestitures, it takes me to this tax asset, these capital loss carry-forwards that we have gotten, just to give our investors a sense of how I think about that big picture because it really comes back to your question around how I think about divestitures. We \u2013 big picture, we are reshaping this portfolio, we are reshaping it to be more contemporary, higher margin, higher performing and more consistent. And that will happen over time through a series of organic and inorganic actions. And clearly the tax asset is one of those tools that we can leverage in this reshaping process, so there could be divestitures at some point. I won\u2019t speculate on when that could happen, I will just say we will do what makes sense for the long-term value creation potential of the company. But the tax asset is not going to drive the company strategy, what maximizes value long-term will.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you. Hey, Tom and Sean, from our modeling the Consumer Foods division is on track to deliver like one of the most profitable years in my recollection and the margins are going to be higher than we have seen ever, can you just give us a sense of like what is running ahead of schedule in terms of your timeframe, what\u2019s surprising you on the upside. And then secondly, there is more savings coming, I am having a little trouble figuring out whether that\u2019s offsetting like corporate expense dissynergies or whether we can take that to the bottom line on Consumer Foods, and if so if we can\u2019t take it to consumer, Sean would you ever consider giving kind of a margin target for where Consumer Foods could go? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Let me hit that margin piece real quick. Rob then we will come back to your other questions. But clearly when we get to our Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will give you the full algorithm for how we are thinking about this. We are hard at work at that right now, so we will give you a sense for what we think we can do on an ongoing basis with that company over time. Obviously though, margin expansion is our first priority and I want Tom to weigh in on this in a second, but let me just say having been in this industry a long time, any time I see an infusion of discipline in a portfolio like ours, I feel good about what lies ahead and then certainly the case here because short-term sacrifice for long-term gain is part of the equation. It\u2019s part of the discipline. And that\u2019s what drove the profitability this quarter. It\u2019s kind of like avoiding the pecan pie after your big holiday dinner. It\u2019s awfully hard in the moment, but you will respect yourself a lot more the next day and you will have less weight to lose before spring breaks. So this is making some of these disciplined choices are not easy because it\u2019s tempting to go after the volume. But when you stick to your convictions, you see the kind of margin expansion that we are beginning to show. And frankly, we got more to go because we have got a diverse portfolio and we are going after the low-hanging fruit, but we are getting keep chipping away at this Tom. Tom, you want to elaborate?","Tom McGough","Sure. Robert, this is Tom McGough. I think what\u2019s materially different is that we have taken a more holistic approach to how we build margins. Certainly, we have had a strong track record of supply chain productivity. What we have added to that is a discipline and the capabilities that Sean have highlighted. It begins with portfolio segmentation where we invest is having a material impact not only on our sales performance, but also our margin performance. You see that on brands like Marie Callender, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim. The second piece is around what Sean highlighted earlier, around pricing, that\u2019s multi-dimensional. It\u2019s being able to be timely and disciplined and effective when there is commodity base inflation. We are a company that in the past had a very strong push mentality to our approach. Our approach on trade promotion is to deliver higher ROI, higher impact promotions. And in the near-term, this would trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness of that. And then the third is taking a holistic look at a brand like we have \u2013 we have talked about many of those, P.F. Chang\u2019s but Banquet. It\u2019s about building margins through product quality upgrades, being able to command the price premium for that, so it\u2019s a more holistic approach. There are new capabilities that we will be adding in terms of integrated margin management. Even more discipline in portfolio segmentation. I think what Sean highlighted is over time, we would expect our margins to grow and that I think is materially different than Consumer Foods over the last 5 years to 7 years.","John Gehring","Robert, this is John, if I can just clarify a piece of your question too. I think what Tom, and Sean are talking about are capabilities we have been working on and we are getting \u2013 we are seeing a really good traction. As I mentioned in my comments, as it relates to our cost savings initiatives both around SG&A and trade, we only expect to see a very modest impact from that this year, so certainly as we go forward we expect a much more significant contribution from that, which I think will enable us both to perhaps put some of that for the bottom line, but also make sure we are investing in the portfolio so that we have a sustainable model, so hopefully that clarifies that.","Operator","We have a question now from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hi Chris.","John Gehring","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had two questions for you if I could, I want to be clear on is the portfolio segmentation that you intend for ConAgra Brands for the Consumer Foods portfolio, is that complete and therefore you are executing against the innovation, the promotional spending, against the categories that you are going to focus on going forward, is that of sort of complete already is really my question?","Sean Connolly","No, it is not complete Chris, with respect to segmentation or innovation. There is some good stuff underway, but frankly we still have a much larger opportunity in front of us. Darren Serrao, as you may know is only three months into his stint and as Chief Growth Officer. And he and Tom are working closely together to evolve our portfolio segmentation approach to the next level from what we have been using in the recent past. So this work will inform what areas we will prioritize going forward and also where we will scale back. And the point here is that we will be very deliberate in how we deploy our resources for maximum return. But on the whole top line side of our equation is earlier days than what we have been doing on costs as an example.","Chris Growe","And perhaps that instructs my second question which is in terms of like incremental marketing spending and you are \u2013 where you are cutting back on promotional spending in areas of the business that you are going to change the kind of the marketing programs, that still is to be decided. So as we have seen increasing marketing this quarter of $80 million, it sounds like it\u2019s going to accelerate in the third quarter, but we are not clear on what brand its going behind or how much that could accelerate at this point, if you given more color on that?","Tom McGough","Sure. Overall \u2013 this is Tom McGough again. We believe in investing in brands, but we have to do it in a very effective \u2013 very disciplined way. It starts with the portfolio segmentation and that is the start in terms of where our best opportunities are. And to that, we hold a standard for each brand to be A&P ready. So what we look at is we have concentrated our spending on those brands that have the best category position, have the best fundamentals and strong margin profile. So our resources, what I am trying to communicate are very surgical, very focused and we are seeing very strong end market results. Earlier, there was a talk about the frozen category Marie Callender continues to grow in a challenged category, strong single-digits in growth. That\u2019s indicative of the discipline and approach that we have in terms of A&P. Would you get more brands A&P ready, over time as we get those brands ready, we will increase our investments.","Operator","We will move now to Tim Ramey with Pivotal Research Group.","Tim Ramey","Thanks so much. Two questions, you called out some higher incentive expenses, should we assume that you are paying retention bonuses for key people in the move or how should we think about that?","John Gehring","Yes. Tim, this is John. On the maybe two things, first of all there are retention payments that we are paying to people as we transition the business. Those are typically captured in our restructuring costs, so that would not be captured in my comment on incentives. The incentives increase is really just simply a function of our pay for performance programs. And unfortunately last year, we did not perform particularly well, which was reflected in lower incentives, particularly in the back half of the year. And as we go forward this year, our expectation is that we are going to perform better, which will lead to higher incentives.","Tim Ramey","Okay. And then just on Banquet, you are reinvesting in the brand proving the product quality, if you could sort of implant the thought in the consumer mind, how would they think about Banquet on a go-forward basis versus kind of this historic, is it cleaner labels, is it fewer unidentifiable chunks, what\u2019s the consumer going to take away if they fully get your marketing message?","John Gehring","Sure. We think it is incredibly strong brand. It\u2019s in nearly one out of every two households. And the core of that brand is providing the family favored foods at a great value. So our fundamental positioning of the brand has not changed, but what\u2019s improved is our overall execution and optimizing that. So what we are advertising is higher quality ingredients, more protein, higher quantity of food up to 25% more. And with that, we have combined that with the price increase to reflect the value and the benefits that we are delivering to the consumer, so same still great positioning a family favorite food at a great value. But we are investing in terms of the product quality and increasing the price commensurate with that.","Operator","We have a question now from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick","Yes. Thanks for the question. Quickly on the balance sheet, John you made some very helpful comments, specifically with respect to the January maturity, you mentioned that you are planning to refinance it with short-term debt and commercial paper, can you clarify whether that short-term debt, it sounds like it\u2019s going to be bank debt as opposed to trimming out some debt in the debt capital markets, is that right?","John Gehring","More than likely, that will be the case because our \u2013 because of the timing of the close of the private brands we need to refinance that before we get the proceeds. So our objective is to be able to turn around and quickly repay that. So we are looking at short-term options there.","Operator","We will move now to Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Lubi Kutua","Good morning. This is actually Lubi filling in for Akshay. Happy holidays to everybody. Just had a quick question. Most of my questions have been answered already, but just regarding the sort of timing of the necessary filing that you have to do for the two standalone businesses, the Lamb Weston and ConAgra Brands. Could you give us any color into when we should expect to see, I think there is a Form 10 or something that needs to be filed? And just sort of the timing of that process if you could give us any color, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes, I can\u2019t tell you with great precision, but I would say later in the spring is what we would be targeting. And again, we will be looking at a number of variables there on that timing, not the least of which is where we need to do to get, how much time do we need to get the work done, but also what\u2019s the best timing there relative to when we think we will be going live, etcetera, but I would say late spring is probably a good place to take it.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question today will be a follow-up from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Thanks for sneaking me in. On Banquet, it\u2019s been sort of the de facto private label entry in the category mainly or in part, because its price was so low. As you raised the price, how do you prevent a private label competitor from coming in taking share, particularly those customers that aren\u2019t traveling with the brand as you say? I guess, I am asking because prices are great when there is no major competitor underneath. Elasticity can be light, but isn\u2019t there a risk that over time if the brand gets stuck in the middle if someone else does come in?","Sean Connolly","Ken I will attempt to answer that. Tom, if I miss something here, chime in, but you don\u2019t tend to see a huge private label presence in categories where you have a large nearly $1 billion well-established kind of value player like a Banquet. So, Banquet has effectively played that role. And furthermore, frozen entr\u00e9es in general, you don\u2019t see a large private label presence. So, I am not overly concerned about that piece at all. It will still be a value, but the value proposition has changed. Frankly, when we talk to Banquet loyalists, some of them clearly say, hey, if you give me better quality, if you give me a little larger portion, if you give me more protein, I am happy to pay for it. That looks like value to me as opposed to just being caught on price. By the same token, there are other consumers in there who over time have been positioned and trained to just buy on deep discount, but we don\u2019t value that consumer purchase the same way we value the other consumer purchase and we are getting more discerning around where we are going to \u2013 whose volume we are going to chase. That\u2019s part of the concern. But I would say net-net I am not particularly worried about that scenario at all.","Ken Goldman","Thanks, Sean.","Operator","There are no further questions.

If you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which includes cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measure for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. Our comparable diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.62 which represents 13% growth, this is inline with revised expectations and we continue to expect comparable diluted EPS of $222 million to $225 million this fiscal year. While there are some operating headwinds in our segments as we discussed in mid February when we revised our fiscal 2014 EPS outlook, we\u2019ve started to realize good SG&A efficiencies and we have line of sight to substantial SG&A savings over the next couple of years as we shared with you at CAGNY I will offer some high level remarks in each of our segments and then go into more detail in a couple of minutes.","Within consumer foods volume was down 3%, price mix was flat and comparable profit was inline with year ago amounts. We expected the volume decline given the challenges we have with Orville Redenbacher\u2019s, Healthy Choice and Chef Boyardee, and renew the topline challenges would weigh on profit, but *effective cost management helped us post a decent profit performance despite a soft topline. Some of our other brands are performing well and we will continue to invest in those parts of the portfolio with strong growth potential.","I will share more depth on consumer foods, but first I want to provide a couple of headlines on commercial foods and Private Brands. Within commercial foods performance was largely as expected with comparable profit down 8% due to the potato crop and lower margins from a customer shift. And within Private Brands, the synergy capture from the acquisition is coming in a little ahead of target, which is clearly good news. We have been successfully working through some operational and customer service related issues as we previously explained, overall we are making gradual progress on the business to remain confident in our long-term Private Brand strategy.","As we communicated last month we are intensely focused on significant improvements across our three business segments. And while there is ground to makeup, there are bright spots in each segment and the work we are doing now is intended to strengthen our prospects for long-term success. We remain committed to our earnings per share guidance for this fiscal year as well as our cash flow and debt reduction commitments. With regard to fiscal 2015 performance, we will say more about timing and amounts and all other relevant details when we have our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call in June.","Now more on consumer foods. Our consumer foods segment posted sales of approximately $1.9 billion and operating profit of $266 million as reported. Sales declined as expected reflecting a 3% volume decrease in flat price mix compared to year-ago period. As you know we have some brands with challenges and I will touch on those in a minute, but that\u2019s not the full picture. We also have brands with dollar sales growth and market share gains for the quarter, including Slim Jim meat snacks, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa, Reddi-wip Topping, Bertolli Frozen Meals and others.","While we will continue to support a number of our brands with advertising such as Hunt\u2019s Tomatoes, Slim Jim, Reddi-wip, PAM, Marie Callender's and others. Our intense focus is on being what we call perfect at retail. We believe that in this ultracompetitive market, getting the four piece right, meaning pricing, packaging, placement and promotion is especially critical.","We offered a few examples of Perfect at Retail at CAGNY, and for the brands where we\u2019re seeing growth and taking share our 4Ps are playing a big role.","Within the three big brands that we\u2019re working to turn around, I\u2019m talking about Healthy Choice; Chef Boyardee and Orville Redenbacher's. We have a specific action plans underway to stabilize and improve performance through product and packaging changes, focused messaging and more impactful in-store initiatives.","Some of these changes will happen quickly and others will take place across the next several quarters. Net-net we expect to see better performance in aggregate across these three brands in F-15 and we\u2019ll keep you apprised. Of course we have other elements to our growth plans for Consumer Foods, we have a number of new products entering the market like PAM Cooking Spray with coconut oil and Bertolli toward us, with a more balanced investment plan than we did this fiscal year.","Our focused programming on pot pies where our market share is high and we\u2019ve got an advantage supply chain this is already help to drive growth in the Marie Callender's and Banquet businesses, we\u2019re capitalizing on that demand trend with our Bertolli brand by using our pot pie capabilities to create Italian style Tortas, meat filled pies stuffed with ricotta, parmesan and mozzarella cheese inside a flaky pastry crust.","We\u2019re also satisfying the consumer demand for pot pies and our strength in that platform with new flavors from Banquet and Marie Callender's such as Salisbury steak, deep dish pot pie from Banquet this demonstrates our ability to grow in already strong platform by leveraging our insights and capabilities.","Moving on to segment profits comparable Consumer Foods operating profit was $270 million for the quarter inline with year ago amounts. On the top line decline rate on profitability several factors favorably contributed to the quarter\u2019s profit performance including supply chain productivity initiatives that more than offset manageable inflation, lower incentives and a strong focus on SG&A related efficiencies.","We also reduced advertising and promotion expense as we focused on efficiencies, and we balanced spending to strengthen and be more effective with promotional support where it made sense, we mentioned this as a plan earlier in the fiscal year.","Within Commercial Foods our third quarter results were inline with what we expected, as we\u2019ve discussed we\u2019re dealing with a suboptimal potato crop, as well as a margin decline from a food service customer loss. We\u2019ve taken the margin hit on the customer shift this year so we should be pass that in fiscal 2015. And separately we\u2019ll be into a new potato crop in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.","Additionally we continue to see rapid growth in Lamb Weston\u2019s International sales, which grew at a double-digit rate in the fiscal third quarter as we capitalized on international expansion of key customers.","And our Milling business, sales declined reflecting the passthrough of lower wheat costs and lower volumes and profits increased on the basis of better mix and efficiencies. As we have said before we expect the Ardent Mills transaction to close in the second quarter of this calendar year. The Ardent JV will allow us to take part in financial gains of a more efficient Milling business without the sales volatility of a commodity oriented business in our base results.","Review this as a long-term strategic win that will enhance ConAgra Foods shareholder value over time. Long-term we expect good accretion from the transaction making this a financially and strategically sound move. And of course a biggest strategic move it has been to dramatically expand our presence in Private Brands. We are pleased with the cost synergy identification and realization we\u2019ve seen so far we are slightly ahead of our fiscal 2014 target of $30 million.","However, as we conveyed in February, we are not satisfied with the fundamentals of our base business. We continue to work to stabilize the base business and our efforts to stabilize have included price concessions we have had to make this fiscal year to prevent further volume issues. Those concessions mean that the margins for the Private Brand segment will continue to be challenged for the next several quarters.","There is no question this has been a period of fighting fires while working to establish a solid foundation with the right structure and focus. We continue to get positive feedback on the strategy and our opportunities from customers. For example with one major customer we increased our Private Brand sales by more than $20 million since the acquisition as we gained business and snacks and serial.","With another customer we\u2019ve recently gained business in three categories previously served by our competition and this customer as noted its own commitment the double-digit growth in their Private Brands business. So clearly there is still a lot of ground to makeup in areas that need to turnaround, but we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of the fact that there are some encouraging bright spots.","And while we expect that the marketplace for Private Brands will continue to be very competitive just as it is for everyone in the Food business. We are confident that our model of offering scale and CPG capabilities in branded and Private Brands as a differentiated and winning proposition long-term.","Now let me address a few questions some of you have been asking about how we plan to manage brands and Private Brands? We\u2019ll continue to prioritize and resource our branded portfolio as our largest segment. We don\u2019t have much overlap among branded and Private Brand product lines and we plan for that to continue to be the case. Overlap will be the exception not the rule.","We\u2019ll leverage our assets and product lines together, where it makes sense to drive growth and create more efficiencies for our business and our customers. We are rewiring our organizations to become even more customer centric and working directly with retailers to develop products that fit their shoppers and their growth plans.","And our growth agenda involves the right use of branded and private label items. We will continue to launch some branded new products nationally. We may launch other new branded items at particular customers, and we\u2019ll launch new Private Brand products on a customer-by-customer basis, one size won\u2019t fit all. That\u2019s the exciting part about having a portfolio like we do. We have the agility and the capabilities of a broad portfolio and we will thoughtfully do what\u2019s best to deliver a win-win with each of our key customers.","As we do that, I want to be very clear that we plan to manage our brand equities for long-term health. We will not jeopardize the long-term help of our brands for our margins. I\u2019ll wrap up by saying that our rich synergy pipeline, as well as improvement initiatives for each of our segments and our intense focus on efficiencies and cost reduction across our cost of good and SG&A expense areas, put us in a good position to resume quality growth as we get past these challenges for our segments.","We believe the hard work we\u2019re doing to configure a more effective and customer centric organization to leverage the breadth and scale of our portfolio will be worth it and we look forward to reporting on our progress in due course. Thanks for taking time to join the call today.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to touch on a number of topics this morning. First, I\u2019ll discuss our fiscal third quarter performance, next I will address comparability matters, then on the cash flow, balance sheet, and capital items, and I will close with some brief comments on our outlook.","As Gary noted, the fiscal third quarter results were slightly better than we had anticipated due principally to lower SG&A, some of which is timing. Overall for the fiscal third quarter, we reported net sales of $4.4 billion, up 15% from the prior year. As a reminder, the prior year amounts included only a few weeks of Ralcorp activity due to the date of the transaction.","And for the quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.58 versus $0.28 in the year-ago period. Diluted EPS adjusted for items impacting comparability were $0.62 versus $0.55 from the prior year quarter of 13% increase.","While Gary has addressed our segment results I would also like to touch on a few points. Starting with our consumer foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.9 billion, about 4% below the year-ago period, reflecting a 3% decline in volume, flat price mix and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange. Our consumer foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $270 million, inline with the year-ago period.","The operating profit reflects the impact of lower net sales, modest inflation and effective cost savings as well as the benefit from lower incentives, marketing and other SG&A costs.","Marketing costs decreased about $15 million, or about 13% from the prior-year quarter. On foreign exchange for this quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $16 million and operating profit by $6 million. Our consumer foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $49 million in the quarter.","For the full fiscal year, we expect cost savings in this segment to be approximately $200 million. Approximately $30 million of additional cost savings will be reflected in other segments as a result of the change in our segment reporting structure.","For the fiscal third quarter we experienced inflation of about 2%. In our commercial foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.5 billion, or about 1% below the prior-year quarter. The net sales declined reflects the pass through of lower wheat cost in our flour milling business, and sales declined in the legacy ConAgra Foods, food service unit formerly included in our consumer foods segment. These declines were partially offset by the addition of food service business previously reported in the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery segment, or which the year-ago quarter reflected limited activity.","Net sales in this segment also reflects stronger volumes in our potato operations offset by lower net pricing. The commercial foods segments operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability decreased 8% from the year-ago period to $180 million. The year-over-year decrease reflects the expected decline in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the contribution from the food service business included in the Ralcorp acquisition and a modest net increase from other businesses in the segment including flour milling. Our Private Brands segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1.1 billion and operating profit excluding items impacting comparability of approximately $66 million inline with our revised expectations.","The operating profit results reflect the impact of price concessions and volume softness across several categories. Also we are making good progress on both COGS and SG&A synergy initiatives and we are on track to achieve our synergy targets for fiscal 2014.","Moving on to corporate expenses, for the quarter corporate expenses were $50 million, adjusting for items impacting comparability corporate expenses were $34 million versus $87 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year change was driven principally by lower incentive and pension costs and other operating cost reductions.","The tax rate for this fiscal quarter was approximately 27%. The rate for this quarter was lower than planned driven by several favorable settlements and changes in estimates. Some of which are treated as items impacting comparability.","Now, I will move on to my next topic. Items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter\u2019s recorded diluted EPS from continuing operations related to several items.","First, we recorded approximately $38 million or $0.06 per share of net expense related to integration and acquisition related and other restructuring costs in connection with our acquisition of Ralcorp. On hedging for the fiscal third quarter, the net hedging gain included in corporate expenses was approximately $52 million, or $0.08 per share.","We also recognized a loss of $55 million or about $0.08 per share related to interest rate derivatives that were acquired several years ago as a hedge in anticipation of refinancing the $500 million or 5.875% debt that matures in April 2014.","Based on an assessment of our debt repayment alternatives and consistent with our commitment to debt reduction, we have decided not to refinance this debt and have therefore recognized a loss on the interest rate hedges in the fiscal third quarter earnings versus deferring the loss over future years. The recognition of the loss has no impact on our previous cash flow estimates. In addition, we recorded a charge of approximately $17 million, or $0.02 per share related to an asset impairment in our commercial foods segment.","And finally, we recorded a tax benefit of about $17 million, or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily resulting from an international tax settlement and additional benefits realized from a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain International sales.","Next I\u2019ll cover cash flow balance sheet and capitalize. First we ended the quarter with $239 million of cash on hand and about $140 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. For fiscal year 2014, we expect cash flows from operating activities to be in the range of $1.4 billion, including a modest contribution from working capital improvement.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, capital expenditures increased to $139 million from $107 million in the prior year period reflecting the addition of Ralcorp businesses. And for fiscal year 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $625 million.","Net interest expense was $95 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $71 million in the year ago quarter. The increase is driven by additional interest expense related to financing the Ralcorp acquisition. Dividends for the quarter increased from $101 million in the year ago quarter to $105 million due to the increase in shares outstanding.","On capital allocation, our priority continues to be at a repayment of debt, as well as strengthening our credit metrics. Consistent with that priority, we currently expect to repay approximately $550 million of debt in fiscal 2014 and a total of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2015. This target excludes any additional repayment we expect to fund from cash proceeds related to the Ardent Mills transaction.","For fiscal 2014, debt repayment will be concentrated in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical seasonal cash flow pattern. As previously noted as we delever, we expect to maintain our current annual dividend at $1 per share and limit our share repurchase plan. This quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.","And while we expect to limit M&A activity in the near-term as we focus on deleveraging and integration, we will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our portfolio for the long-term, we will also continue to prudently invest behind innovation, production capacity, and our cost savings initiatives.","Now I\u2019d like to share some comments on our fiscal 2014 full-year outlook. As we noted during our CAGNY presentation a few weeks ago, we expect that our full fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding items impacting comparability, will be in the range of $2.22 to $2.25. And while the third quarter EPS results were slightly better due to lower SG&A costs. We remain appropriately cautious about some of the short-term challenges we face over the balance of 2014, which is why our yearly guidance has not changed. As we have noted previously we are in the process of developing our plans for fiscal year 2015, while we are not in a position today to provide a detailed outlook for fiscal 2015. I would like to reiterate a few key points from my CAGNY Conference. First, on the top line, we are focused on solutions the top line challenges we have faced this year in each of our operating segments.","Second on margins, we believe our strong supply chain productivity and our focus on SG&A efficiency and effectiveness will provide us with the opportunity to expand margins over time. While we do face some headwinds, such as the pace of margin recovery in Private Brands, Ardent Mills dilution and higher incentives. We continue to expect EPS growth for fiscal 2015, but we currently expect that it will be less than the double-digit rate we previously estimated.","We will provide more specific comments about the fiscal 2015 outlook in connection with our fiscal 2014 year-end release when final plans have been completed. That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass will be happy to take your questions.","I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, we would like to get to an important part of today\u2019s call taking your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted via the telephone. (Operator Instructions) And our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Good morning, everyone.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning, Andrew.","Christopher Wright Klinefelter","","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Gary, I know you're not at a point yet as John mentioned where you are going to give fiscal 2015 guidance, but I think most street estimates have you \u2013 call it roughly 7% or 8% earnings growth for next year. I thought maybe it would be helpful just to go through a quick, maybe metal accounting of some of the puts and takes some of which John had mentioned as they \u2013 the ones that are kind of discrete that we know about today as it relate to 2015 and that can help isolate maybe where there is still less visibility on some of the core. But \u2013 so on tailwinds you've obviously got the ongoing productivity, you\u2019ve got the incremental overhead work you are doing that you discussed at CAGNY.","I think you may have an extra week in fiscal 2015, but you can correct me on that if I'm wrong? There are some synergies I think start to play out in a bigger way and you certainly got some easier comparisons on volume and as you mentioned you\u2019re kind of lapping the poor potato crop and the loss of their food service customer. I guess on the headwind side, you talked about the Ardent Mills JV dilution, some compensation expense increased and then I guess that leaves us with the sort of the base business and I guess what I\u2019m getting at is there anything major that I\u2019m missing on the sort of the puts and takes for next year?","It would seem that you\u2019ll have some flexibility as you mentioned there for some earnings growth even in the context of some weaker core businesses, but I guess we don\u2019t know this yet, but in terms of the core business are you sort of anticipating let\u2019s say volume trends in consumer and Private Brands can be roughly flattish for the year or getting to flat by the end of the year, but just trying to get a sense of if we\u2019ve got these puts and types rights and what that leaves you with flexibility?","John F. Gehring","","All right, Andrew that\u2019s quite a comprehensive understanding of our business\u2026","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thanks for bearing with me.","John F. Gehring","I applaud you for that. Let\u2019s be really clear, our challenges won\u2019t disappear on day one of the new fiscal year, but we\u2019re making progress, you outlined a lot of that and we\u2019ll have a better year. Than we did this year, yes, we do have a 53 week next year. So that\u2019s certainly the plus. If we take a look at each of the three businesses, I\u2019d say Private Brands will make gradual progress. The operational and customer service issues are mostly behind us, our organization is getting more experience in the business, but we still will be dealing with a lot of the overlap of the pricing concessions that we made this year and continuing challenging market environment.","On the consumer side, the three big problem brands that we\u2019ve discussed will perform better in fiscal 2015, basically against a real maniacal focus on the core category users, some product and package changes, very targeted marketing. And then in commercial foods as you noted, Lamb Weston will have a \u2013 we expect to normalize the potato corp, we\u2019ll have that food service customer loss in our base and we\u2019ll continue to drive double-digit growth in the international. So I\u2019d say net net there is certainly are still some headwinds, particularly as you look at the Private Brand business, but net net we\u2019ll have a very \u2013 next year we\u2019ll give you more detail in the Q4 earnings call.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Great, thanks for your help.","John F. Gehring","Thank you.","Operator","","And we\u2019ll move now to David Driscoll with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","","Good morning, this is Cornell for David.","John F. Gehring","","Good morning, Cornell.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Good morning, Cornell.","Unidentified Analyst","","Great, first just little positive looking to be one of the biggest parts of the Ralcorp private label portfolio. I wanted to know is this product line were \u2013 is this product line were most of the issues that you are having within private label occurring or the problems more generally spread across the portfolio?","Gary M. Rodkin","","Yes, I would describe it as more generally spread, the other parts of business is important category for us and we are very committed to improving that one as well. But everything that Gary described is \u2013 I\u2019d described it as more general across the whole portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then in terms of just going to Consumer Foods are straight promotion dollars now at levels that you being proper or where sales coming in a little bit soft in that segment during the quarter, do you think that you need to ramp up trade spending further on future quarters? And can you talk a little bit more about some of the tactical adjustments that you are taking to fix some of the troubled brands in consumer like Chef Boyardee, Orville and Wesson.","Tom McGough","","Sure, this is Tom McGough, several parts of your question. And let me kind of decompose into a couple factors, if you look at our Q3 volume performance 50% of our volume change was due to our change in consumption and 50% of the change with due to a shift in the Thanks Giving timing. And some volume that we will move with a shift in Q3, shift in Q2.","So our underlying performances some like better than the 3%, when it comes to overall performance, the weaker consumption was a result of the three brands that we discussed, we\u2019re executing some changes on these brands to be sharper in terms of our pricing promotion, getting our packaging our in-store condition is right that\u2019s the Perfect at Retail. Those type of changes are going to happened more quickly, while others are going to take place over several quarters, we expect the volume on those business to generally improve throughout FY15.","And when you look at our business excluding those three challenged brands, the volume to the rest of the portfolio is actually grown in each of the last three quarters and we feel very confident that our marketing and our promotional programs are on target with those brands.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to a question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi, good morning everyone.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","John, just a question about free cash flow or operating cash flow, I guess for 2014, you\u2019re still looking at $1.4 billion for operating cash flow and then for 2015, I guess what you said at CAGNY was that you expected to be $1.6 billion or better so, I guess given that the sort of the earnings outlook for 2014 and for 2015 is below the original plan. How we bridge that the operating cash flow in 2014 more or less stay the same. And then we\u2019re going to and then plan is to grow operating cash flow almost 15% next year, can you just sort of talk about some of the moving parts with an operating free cash flow and maybe potentially free cash flow.","John F. Gehring","","Yes, we\u2019ll obviously update this as we get into the \u2013 our full outlook. But I\u2019d say, couple of things that I would point to is that I think that cash flow committed to incentives in 2015 versus 2014, because those have paid in arrears we are going to have a pick up as we go into next year. I think we also see some working capital opportunities in certain parts of our business that will be working.","And I think just some of the cash outlay we have in terms of one-time integration costs and those sorts of things will be smaller. So I think there\u2019s a number of factors there and as I said we will certainly be updating and providing more visibilities we get into next quarter.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","If the earnings had tracked to original plan with the operating cash flow generation actually be higher than it is. Just trying to get a sense for whether or not if you get into a more sort of normal or cope more inside the range of what you envisioned in terms of profitability whether the cash flow generation actually will be higher than these levels.","Gary M. Rodkin","","I think all things being equal as earnings go up, cash flow generally will tract, what it there can be some periodic disconnects, but over time we certainly would expect that to be the case.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets has our next question.","Jonathan P. Feeney \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Good morning. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about Ralcorp synergies specifically not only like where you stand right now, you\u2019ve updated us on, but also, you made some structural changes to the business Gary at least versus what was original plan, may be brought in some costs for management and changed a way you are approaching things, have you changed your thought about how much synergy this candidates best incarnation produce and can you update us as to a sort of where we stand versus \u2013 maybe going forward.","John F. Gehring","","Yes, Jonathan this is John, let me take a short at that, I think as we said, I think we\u2019ve talked about this first year, we capture about $30 million I think we feel good about being on track with probably be slightly above that. I think in terms of our target run rate by the end of fiscal 2017, I think we still feel good about the $300 million, I would note that separately as Gary has talked about we have talked about additional work around our business structure and SG&A effectiveness and efficiency and how we wired the organization and we will mind some additional benefits out of that, but as part of that pure synergy play we are talking about is really still had $300 million.","And I will also note that most of that is going to be in the cost of goods supply chain area. So now will change there, but we still feel good and feel like we\u2019re on track.","Jonathan P. Feeney \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","How much, since the course of the acquisition, how much as the cost of goods coming down a little bit, just a trajectory of input cost in that sort of sticky price business helped you? And I guess as part of that it seems like, something didn\u2019t go exactly according to plan, so it was just that your initial plans were really, really conservative. And so now you still able to deliver despite you\u2019re having makewholes for one investment or what all have been puts and takes and allow you to maintain that despite some costs put back in the business?","John F. Gehring","","Yeah, let me take a shot now and maybe turn it over to Paul. I think as we look at synergies, we\u2019re looking at how do we drive costs out of our inputs, our conversion, our distribution. And I think, we would expect those to track. I think the challenges we have in the business have been more in terms of top line and pricing.","Jonathan P. Feeney \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Okay.","Gary M. Rodkin","","So, I think the challenge for us is to continue deliver on that lower cost base. At the same time, we look at all of the other levers in the business to continue to rebuild those margins over time. And, again, as Gary indicated that will be a gradual process. But I don\u2019t want to say those two issues are not connected because they\u2019re ultimately connected at the gross margin line in the business. But the synergies are really focused on costs not the numbers we\u2019ve talked about our costs not the top line.","Paul T. Maass","","I might add a little just around a lot of focus on better customer execution sold to supply chain. I believe, there are a lot of synergies around the operational aspects of total network and we\u2019re very focused on that. I think you did reference just the structure \u2013 organizational structure and more focus. And we believe that will absolutely payoff over time.","Jonathan P. Feeney \u2013 Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","","Thank you. I will ask one detailed question. I know you probably are sensitive about your customer names, but the food service customer you lost, that is distributor or restaurant, can you tell us?","Paul T. Maass","","It was in the food service distribution arena.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, can you hear me?","Gary M. Rodkin","","Yes, we can. Good morning, Akshay. Good morning.","John F. Gehring","Yes, good morning.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, good morning. So and my question is on Private Brands, and I\u2019m just trying to understand in that business specifically, what are the structural issues that you\u2019re dealing with that perhaps are going to take a longer time to fix relative to, let\u2019s say the previous management team? And then what are some of the more operational issues? And if you could help us quantify some of that just roughly that would be great, because it seems to us from the numbers we are looking at and whatever we have to compare which is when you bought this business, the previous management team had it running at a $100 million in EBIT for a quarter. And the latest quarter you reported was 50%, 60% below that in spite of benefit from synergies.","You are talking about price concessions and things of that short, but the magnitude of the deterioration in the business it is so severe that I\u2019m having a hard time understanding what part of that is structural and what part of that is operational issues that you can fix and if you can give some color on categories that would be very helpful? Thanks.","John F. Gehring","","Yes, Akshay this is John. Let me start with just making sure we are clear on one thing which is we have now changed our operating segments in a way we report our business. So the businesses that we acquire from Ralcorp are now spread throughout three operating segments we operate today. So it\u2019s not as simple as looking at legacy Ralcorp financial statements and in comparing it to the Private Brand segments because those pieces have been reorganized and split up.","So that comparison isn\u2019t to a comparison. Clearly there have been some challenges in the center of the store Private Brand business that we acquired, that largely as part of our Private Brands business now, but I just want to make sure we are clear that that comparison is not the right one. I will turn it over to Paul now maybe just comment on some of the issues in the business that he is working on.","Paul T. Maass","","Yes, you know maybe just a little bit on the environment itself, so the backdrop has some commodity deflation, increased merchandising commercial activity by the brands. Our short-term executional challenges that I would clearly linked to just the challenges of integrating two companies together, so that\u2019s kind of the backdrop that increased the kind of the contracting bid activity with customers, we saw in an normally high level of that in the short-term and I would say we are through a lot of that, and really focused on stabilization and improving margins as we go forward.","John F. Gehring","","So Akshay, you\u2019ll get all three of us here, that\u2019s a really important question and clearly we are not happy and satisfied with our overall results in this business, but importantly we need to remember this is a long-term play. Private Brands for all of the reasons we\u2019ve talked about we believe will absolutely be a long-term growth sector in the industry and long-term we are advantaged scale, breadth, capabilities none of these advantages have thus far come into play, not yet. In this \u2013 honestly in this year one we\u2019ve been back on our yields like Paul talked about. It\u2019s all been about price, but as we get a more solid foundation with our customers and frankly our own organization. We\u2019ll bring these competitive advantages to bear in over time this will absolutely change this is a transformation and frankly it\u2019s a lot more complex than just a normal integration because of that, the long-term strategy sound.","","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","","[indiscernible]","Gary M. Rodkin","","We are having difficulty hearing you.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Can you hear me now?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Good morning this is Scott [indiscernible] for Thilo. Just a couple of questions around the inflation outlook, what was the outlook, and is there any impact from the California job expected.","John F. Gehring","","Yes, this is John, what I tell you is that as we look for the balance of this year we expect inflation to continue to be in the 1% or 2% range, I would say as it relates to the next year, we\u2019re not going to commit to final estimate, yet until we go through, the rest of our work obviously given some of the recent volatility especially in proteins. And if you reference California we have some exposure obviously with the tomatoes, you\u2019re a bit more cautious about this for 2015, but I think we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those brands as we finalize our plans.","Thilo Wrede \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Okay, great and then a follow-up in terms of the CapEx and the interest expense guidance why the change and what are you planning to do with the incremental upside from the expected lower interest expense thanks.","John F. Gehring","Yes, I\u2019m not sure our interest expense outlook has changed all that dramatically for this year. CapEx I think our CapEx call for the fiscal 2014 is probably down about $25 million. And again I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s going to drive any significant change in any of our capital allocation, given our focus on debt repayment.","Christopher Wright Klinefelter","","This is Chris, I would just consider those refinement as we get further in the year to original estimates.","","Operator","Now we\u2019ll take a question now from Goldman Sachs, Jason English.","Jason M. English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Hey, good morning folks, thanks for the question.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning.","Jason M. English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","I too want to focus back on the Private Brand side, so Paul I guess the question for you. If you think about your contract position do you have on retailers in the volume expectations associated with that clearly this time last year, they would have been going lower on the contract losses or they now moving higher off of the bottom and if so sort of when we will cycle that bottom.","Paul T. Maass","","Just to make sure, I\u2019m Paul, and you are talking about volume decline, volume expectations going forward.","Jason M. English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, pretty much.","Paul T. Maass","","Yes. So, we\u2019ve been navigating through what I said in abnormally high contracting bid equation and it is driven by those things I referenced earlier. I would describe that as more normalized. And as we go forward it will be a gradual improvement and focusing the organization very heavily on margin improvement is the real key as we go through FY2015.","Jason M. English \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Well, let\u2019s drill down on that a little bit more than because clearly the margins are quite low for the business now. What is \u2013 what are the components that help you recover on a go forward in light sort of pricing concessions, you\u2019re having to make to stabilize this business?","Paul T. Maass","","Yes, I think in the customer facing piece, pricing mix, distribution gains really driven by leveraging in our insights category management capabilities is critical. And we recognize that will help on the customer side. A lot of focus on operations and supply chain of the network optimization is something that it does take time, but we\u2019re committed to and believe that there is leverage there, the combination of the Ralcorp acquisition with the legacy ConAgra Foods platform. The combination of the two, that there is benefit that we have there. We just have to aggressively get executed.","Gary M. Rodkin","","And Jason, this is Gary, I would also go back again and say, we\u2019ve been back on our heels. So, we\u2019ve been in an extreme reactive mode. We have to get to the point as we stabilize, which we gradually will to be much more proactive with our customers gain their confidence and credibility with our customers, take us out of as many bit situations. I see that clearly coming and when that happens we will be able to improve our margins because it won\u2019t be about that last tenth of a penny any every time. Right now, frankly I hate to admit it but it is that\u2019s going to change over time. So, when we put all those elements together that Paul talked about in that over time, clearly we will start to see margin improvement and I expect to see that start to happen sometime next year.","Operator","","We'll move now to David Palmer with RBC Capital.","David S. Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thanks and good morning. Earlier in the fiscal year, you would lean harder on innovation in advertising, you shifted more of your dollars back to promotion, you can correct me, if I am wrong on this, but as TV ad spendings down in the quarter. Could you talk about the adjustments that you\u2019ve made within the fiscal year and what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not working that\u2019s as you do that?","Tom McGough","","Sure David. This is Tom McGough. We look at our portfolio in two segments. The three fix and grow brands that we discussed. Our plan there is to focus on three components. One getting the fundamentals right, you\u2019ve heard Gary talk about being a Perfect at Retail. That\u2019s more than just price and promotion it\u2019s a product, the package, the placement in store. We are making those changes now and we\u2019ll be flowing those in.","The second component, the balance of our portfolio is actually growing net of those three brands. And we feel that we struck the right balance between the consumer pole, the merchandizing push, we feel we have the right balance on those businesses. And we focused our attention on getting the fundamentals right on the first \u2013 on those three fix and grow brands and being more competitive in driving our brand preference.","Operator","We have a question now from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","Good morning, everyone.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Good morning.","John F. Gehring","Good morning.","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","So I wanted to ask question about the Millennial consumers, you mentioned I think at CAGNY the recruiting younger consumer is a challenge for those three big brands. Which other brands can you use to target that demographic and is it possible to renovate those brands to attract these consumers, or is it really just more a matter of managing the volume down on those third products over the time? Thank you.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Yes, Alexia, I think some of our brands do certainly have some play with Millennial is clearly a brand like Alexia, which I\u2019m sure you would like.","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","","I know it well.","Gary M. Rodkin","","That definitely has some pull there, I would also tell you a number of places in our Private Brand business. That is clearly one that Millennials are open to that would be another place for many of the categories we plan and frankly primarily on the male side, but not exclusively Slim Jim plays extremely well with Millennials and that brand is doing very, very well. So we do have some brand, but I would tell you the core businesses, those three that you mentioned. We are going to go after the core users and we\u2019ll pick some Millennials up along the way through as most things, but it won\u2019t be our focus.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse AG","Hi, thank you.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Good morning.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse AG","Gary, thank you for the clarity on the issue that I think you raised at CAGNY about how to manage a hybrid business between brand and private label, and I think you mentioned the word being agnostic and I think you\u2019ve provided some good specifics here about what the guard rails are. But I guess I\u2019m still a little bit interested in what you meant when you said that you would launch branded products that would be specific to retailers. I think what I\u2019ve seen at times are when retailers put their brand and then in conjunction there is a national brand on the label as well, are you exploring that? And then lastly maybe, have you thought further about the possibility or where you would and wouldn\u2019t introduce private label versions of your own brands? Thanks.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Rob, I would tell you that I\u2019m going let Tom give you a few specific examples about some brands that have been launched at particular customers. Just conceptually we want to really as we\u2019ve said, the very customer centric and recognized that the customers are very interested in what\u2019s going to sell with their shoppers, and when they get behind that, that\u2019s the most powerful mechanism more than any kind of marketing that we could do on our own, when they give us that kind of support.","So *there are times and again exception rather than rule, where we might layout an opportunity for a major customer only, when there is a big enough size of price that in a particular category, where we might not play in that very specific segment that we might be willing to go on the Private Brand side or let them go on the branded side, but again, exception not the rule, but Tom want to talk about a few specifics.","Tom McGough","","Sure. There\u2019s three things that come to mind. If you look at the channels that are growing the fastest, whether it\u2019s a club channel, dollar channel, you have to be able to customize your offering to have the right price product package to fit that format. And one example of that would be on PAM Cooking Spray for us to compete more effectively in the club channel, we are moving forward with an extra virgin olive oil product that is right in the bull's eye of those club customers.","We will also look at how we can take a brand like Wolf Chili. We\u2019ve actually made a take house style variety that\u2019s customized to the consumers within a particular class of trade. And then we talked about and we showcased that CAGNY the Bertolli Italian tortas. That\u2019s a product that we have an ability to customize our varieties across class of the trade to fit that offering to that particular concentrate.","Operator","And we have a question now from Bank of America, Greg Hessler.","Greg Hessler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks for the taking the question.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Hessler \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I wanted to just go back to free cash flow just looking through the guidance for the full-year at $1.4 billion and what\u2019s you guys are expecting in terms of CapEx. I\u2019m getting to call $350 million or so our free cash flow in the fourth quarter, so I\u2019m just wondering how you bridge the gap on the debt reduction getting to that $950 million number for the full-year?","John F. Gehring","","Yes, Greg this is John. I would say this year I think as I\u2019ve commented on several occasions we will expect to use some of our offshore cash this year as well as some proceeds we\u2019ve generated from sales of non-core assets those will be sources of cash this year that we\u2019ll utilize to achieve our goal. So that probably the major part of the bridge.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a follow-up question now from Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks for taking the follow-up. My question is on repositioning your product portfolio even more. And then why not just take a few of your larger consumer brands and monetize themselves and get back a little bit faster on the M&A bandwagon on the private label side.","It seems to me that markets valuing you stock like your consumer business is always going to be structurally challenged and has very low brand equity and you can\u2019t really *own the stock for private label growth and not because of the issues you are having on your base business, but because your hands are tied on the M&A.","So is that something you might consider as to *prune your consumer portfolio little bit more pay down debt faster and sort of start with the M&A a little bit faster than you decided to on Private Brands? Thank you.","John F. Gehring","","Yes, Akshay I\u2019m not \u2013 we are not going to speculate on things we might buy or sell at any point in time. What I would tell you as I think we consistently and continually look at our portfolio and as you\u2019ve seen us we\u2019ll follow just for a while, that we do make moves with our portfolio from time-to-time, we continue to evaluate it, but at this point we are pretty pleased with what we have, but again we will continue to refine it and improve that as we can.","Akshay S. Jagdale \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great, thanks.","Operator","And we will take another follow-up from David Palmer.","David S. Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, question for Paul it looks like the Asia food service, China food service trends were already growing double-digits in that quarter, are you seeing a nice acceleration in that business even through the quarter as perhaps some of those leading changed over there or healing after the issues they had last year.","Paul T. Maass","","Yes, thanks David. Our Lamb Weston international business is growing above double-digit and so we\u2019re pleased with that \u2013 that\u2019s helping and I just would say kind of the overall outlook in those regions feels like it\u2019s headed in a more improving and more positive outlook and have worked through a lot of those challenges that they had faced.","David S. Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Gary M. Rodkin","","Yes. Thanks David.","","Operator","And we have a follow-up now from Bryan Spillane.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi, thanks. Hey, John just following up on the cash flow question again, can you just highlight for us cash restructuring costs what you are expecting for 2014, what you are expecting for 2015, and then also I guess maybe what 2014 is today versus what you\u2019re thinking before, again just cash restructuring costs.","John F. Gehring","I do not have that at my finger tips I have to go back and look it. I think the proxy for that probably go back and look at the comparability of items over the year, and if I get pretty close, as it relates to mix shift clearly we would expect those costs as it relates to the integration of Ralcorp to continue to decline. And I have talked previously about our efficiency and effectiveness restructuring over the next couple of years not being more than $80 million over the next couple of years.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So part of the increase in operating cash flow 2014 to 2015 will should be that we would see less or a lower level of cash restructuring cost?","John F. Gehring","Yes. I think that\u2019s generally the trend we would expect.","Bryan D. Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, fine.","John F. Gehring","And again, just to be clear fiscal 2013 incentives, where we had a strong year of fiscal 2013 those incentives were high, those were paid out in fiscal 2014, fiscal 2014 incentives are lower, those get paid out in fiscal 2015 so you can probably estimate some math there that create some tailwind beginning the year.","Bryan D.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Kearney","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements during today's call. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. Descriptions of the risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales growth, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings press release for additional information on our comparability items.","The reconciliations of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in either the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website conagrabrands.com. We'll also be making references to total ConAgra Brands as well as Legacy ConAgra Brands. References to Legacy ConAgra Brands refer to measures that excludes any income or expenses associated with the recently acquired Pinnacle Foods business. Finally, we will be making references to pro forma net sales for Pinnacle. Pro forma net sales refer to results for Pinnacle Foods prior to the acquisition that have been adjusted to align with ConAgra's fiscal calendar.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. There's a lot to cover this morning; we have strong Legacy ConAgra results to discuss, a positive Pinnacle integration update to share, deleveraging to discuss, and a preview of our April 10th Investor Day. But the most important takeaway from everything Dave and I will discuss today is what these results mean, the ConAgra Way to profitable growth delivers.","The impact of our unwavering commitment to the ConAgra Way over the past several years has been consistent progress, most recently resulting in the continued strong momentum in core Legacy ConAgra Brands during the third quarter, particularly in our leading frozen and snacks businesses. We are now aggressively applying this approach to Pinnacle and it's working to keep the technical integration on track as well as driving a reinvigorated innovation lineup.","As we said in Q2, we expect that innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. It also enabled us to gain traction on delevering. In the short five months since closing the Pinnacle transaction, we've reduced debt by $685 million. Overall, we are confident we will deliver quality long-term growth at ConAgra and we'll share our robust innovation pipeline and new long-term financial algorithm on April 10th along with details of the increased cost synergy opportunities that we see.","Before I get into the quarter, let me talk a bit more about the ConAgra Way. We'll unpack this even further at Investor Day, but this playbook is our bedrock and you've seen us execute it for several years now. The ConAgra Way to profitable growth is relentlessly principle based and firmly grounded in the consumer. It advocates that growth is essential and that we cannot and will not cut our way to prosperity.","It acknowledges that our ability to build strong brands requires differentiated capabilities, particularly those that fuel innovation; areas like demand science, precision marketing, and omni-commerce. And the ConAgra Way recognizes that our success requires a highly disciplined approach to portfolio management, which you've seen us execute consistently for the past four years.","Importantly, our disciplined approach is repeatable and scalable. It built our healthy and growing frozen and snacks businesses and serves as the basis for how we're approaching the rest of our portfolio, including Pinnacle. We're confident about how we do things around here because it works. We don't take shortcuts. We do things the right way, a way that best positions us for maximum value creation over the long haul. So, let's talk more about the results the ConAgra Way delivered in Q3.","First up is the Legacy ConAgra business. We continued to deliver good consumption growth in our Legacy ConAgra segments in the quarter with strong trends on both a year-over-year and two-year basis. As you can see on Slide 8, Legacy ConAgra's domestic retail segments had another good quarter. Q3 growth in our Legacy segments was once again based on solid fundamentals tied to the increasing strength of our brands.","Our retail sales and base velocities remained in fertile territory and continued to gain momentum on a two-year basis. Turning to our segment results. Refrigerated & Frozen was up 240 basis points in the quarter with Frozen again delivering terrific growth, 490 basis points. Refrigerated was down but as I mentioned last quarter, apart from Reddi-wip, we have yet to renovate these brands and bring new innovation to the marketplace.","Refrigerated is one of the final pieces of the Legacy ConAgra portfolio to receive attention, but the work is well under way and you'll see exciting new products on store shelves in 2019. But turning back to Frozen, we've talked a lot in prior quarters about the successful implementation of our playbook in Frozen. As you can see on Slide 10 that success continued in Q3, we reinvigorated and continued to lead the Frozen category and our fundamentals remained strong in the quarter with improvement in consumption trends, TPDs, and base sales velocity.","Our approach is having a positive impact on our results and importantly, it's also driving category growth in frozen single-serve meals. Our rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brands through renovation and innovation has delivered impact for ConAgra and for our customers. While we began our innovation journey in Frozen more than a year ago and went broader and deeper in frozen in fiscal 2019, we have even more on the way.","In fiscal '20, we expect to have our most robust and powerful slate of innovation in this segment yet. The team has done a lot of great work to develop a strong multi-year pipeline of innovation across our Legacy ConAgra frozen brands and across refrigerated brands like Hebrew National, Egg Beaters, and Reddi-wip. Turning to our Legacy ConAgra Grocery & Snacks segment, we have more positive news to report. The snacks business grew by 8.2% during the quarter. This tremendous growth validates our recent investment in the business.","Looking at our snacks business in more detail on Slide 14, the growth we delivered in Q3 came with contributions from every key snacking vertical; popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats,and seeds. On a two-year basis, retail dollar sales for our Legacy ConAgra snacking portfolio were up an impressive 14%. Dissecting the snacks growth which we've done on Slide 15; you'll see that while TPD's were down, base velocities increased significantly.","In other words, our growth in snacks during the quarter was driven by bringing terrific products to market that consumers wanted. Those products were in high demand and moved off shelves very quickly and growth through improved consumer pull is sustainable growth. Of course TPDs have been an important metric in assessing brand health historically, but TPDs are not always a helpful barometer of brand vitality.","As an example, look at the Slim Jim results. Slim Jim is one of our healthiest brands and is driving strong snacks growth, but Slim Jim's TPDs declined nearly 18% year-over-year as we optimized our assortment. With that data point alone, you'd think the brand was struggling, but it was not. Velocity was up more than 28% and the net result was a retail sales improvement of more than 7% in the quarter. Our Slim Jim business became stronger by increasing shelf inventory and facings on our best selling, fastest moving items and by pruning low velocity SKUs.","These actions led to higher sales for both ConAgra and our customers and TPDs did not tell the story. We saw the exact same dynamic on Swiss Miss in Q3 and I share this because it's a good reminder that TPD optimization does not always come through TPD growth. I'm very excited about the innovation that we deployed across snacks in the last year and even more excited about the impact of that innovation, but we're not even close to being done.","To the point I highlighted earlier regarding Refrigerated & Frozen, our innovation and renovation machine is humming and we have a terrific multi-year pipeline built out for the brands you see here. I won't go further into it now, you'll have to wait until Investor Day. So in summary on Legacy ConAgra, we feel very good about our momentum. We're pleased with the results we delivered in Q3 and are confident that with the ConAgra Way, we'll continue to deliver.","Turning to Pinnacle priorities on Slide 18, it's been a short five months since we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle, we've accomplished a great deal in that time with much more to come. I'll spend a few minutes covering each of our focus areas, integrating the business; reinvigorating Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone via innovation; and deleveraging. First, let's talk about the integration. I couldn't be happier with our progress on this front so far.","We've said all along that the similarities between Legacy ConAgra and Pinnacle made a combination of our two companies an obvious opportunity and the fact that we've been able to quickly align our organizations and deliver our integration work plan to-date is evidence of how well the two companies mesh. Put a finer point on it, work transitions are on track and processes are being aligned; systems integration are well on their way with key milestones being hit; and importantly, we captured approximately $12 million of cost synergy in Q3 which paces ahead of our expectations.","We continue to expect to over deliver the $215 million of cost synergies we previously announced and we'll share more detail on refined cost synergy opportunities next month. Thank you to the entire ConAgra team across Legacy ConAgra and Pinnacle for all their terrific work to-date on the integration. We've also been spending time in Q3 undertaking a concentrated effort to begin deploying the ConAgra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio and first up is our proven value over volume philosophy.","We are starting the process of cutting slower turning and lower margin SKUs while redesigning Pinnacle's customer investments for better ROI. Retail sales and TPDs continued their downward trends in Q3, but base velocities improved as shown in the chart on the right, non-investment grade SKUs were the ones being pruned in the quarter and that means that the Pinnacle products remaining on shelf are higher quality and generating consumer takeaway.","As we did with our Legacy ConAgra business several years ago, we are creating a stronger foundation on which to build. While we won't be happy until total retail sales begin to turn in the Pinnacle portfolio, we are confident that the value over volume process under way gives us that stronger foundation. As we introduce future innovation slates into the market, the net result will be more profitable sustainable growth.","To be clear, our Pinnacle-related work is incredibly focused. Right now, it's all about strengthening Pinnacles Big 3; Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, and Wish-Bone. Pinnacle historically referred to these brands as leadership brands and with good reason. However, in the second half of last year, each of these businesses struggled with executional issues. These challenges hurt sales and profit representing the vast majority of Pinnacle's drop off on each.","While recent performance in these great brands has been below historical norms, as we discussed last quarter, we're confident that we can reinvigorate them through great innovation and Q3 brought the beginning of our implementation of focused action plans for each brand. First, let's talk about Birds Eye. Birds Eye is an iconic billion dollar brand previously the largest in the Pinnacle portfolio and now the largest in the ConAgra portfolio.","Recently, however, the Birds Eye brand was slow to respond to key consumer trends, opting out of innovating in important growth pockets. That is changing. The differentiating capabilities that come with the ConAgra Way include a well-developed innovation muscle and the know-how to identify and capitalize on consumer trends. Applying these capabilities to Birds Eye means that we're not only opting in to the innovation opportunities in this key category, but opting in in a big way.","Here again we've already built a multi-year pipeline of innovation and renovation that will deliver a sequenced deluge of new Birds Eye products. We'll share a lot more in April. Now let's turn to Duncan Hines. While Duncan Hines' recent results have been disappointing, it faces a different situation than Birds Eye. Recall the Duncan Hines brand actually did a fair amount of innovation over the past two years. The brand moved into broader snacking with a very innovative idea for Mug Cakes.","With this innovation, the Pinnacle team was clearly heading in the right direction. However, the execution of that innovation was not up to our standards. Inefficient SKUs proliferated while competitors entered the space with a more provocative execution, generated better velocities, and gained share. And that new innovation from the competition caused Duncan Hines to suffer. The good news is that we see the solutions here as straightforward even if they'll take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace.","Slide 23 shows how deploying the ConAgra Way to Duncan Hines is leading to a restage of the product with simplified branding, a larger size impression, an optimized SKU range, and an upgraded product with the simple addition of the hero ingredient consumers want, frosting. And finally, let's talk about Wish-Bone where the situation is again unique. In the summer of 2018 Wish-Bone labels were updated, but unfortunately the execution came up short.","Despite a more modern design, the labels did not effectively communicate the flavor variety and variety communication is absolutely essential in salad dressing. Take a look at the picture on the left. The modernized label communication was flawed and sales velocities declined quickly and considerably following the label change. Fortunately, this issue has an obvious fix. The right side of Slide 24 shows our updated label. It prominently features the dressing variety.","Again, a simple solution, but one that will take a bit of time to cycle into the marketplace, after it does, we believe that consumer takeaway for this iconic brand will improve. Overall, the health of the big three Pinnacle brands is critically important and you can be assured that our teams have spent the last five months incredibly focused on each of them. There is definitely more work to do and it will take some time for customers to add our new innovation into their shelf resets.","Again as we said in Q2, we expect innovation to lead to improved Pinnacle trends in the second half of fiscal 2020. But the point I want you to take away today is that we have dug into what exactly ails each brand and we are squarely on top of the solutions. But top line growth isn't our only focus, we're also focused on improving margins across the Pinnacle portfolio and generating more cash from each dollar sold.","Over the last several years we've built capabilities that address each of the margin levers noted on Slide 25 and deployed them across the Legacy ConAgra portfolio. And now we're focused on getting Pinnacle's gross margins back on track with solid realized productivity above our cost synergy initiatives, margin accretive innovation, improved pricing capabilities, a better brand mix, a better channel mix, and trade optimization.","In other words, we're intensely focused on infusing the ConAgra Way into Pinnacle. Part of this is simply ensuring that our newest team members, those from Pinnacle, understand the fundamentals of our approach. I've always said that the cultures at ConAgra and Pinnacle have many overlaps, particularly with respect to our common embrace of a lean and agile culture and that's still my belief.","But we also approach some things differently and we're excited to share our ConAgra processes and tools, particularly those that drive innovation based growth such as demand science, precision marketing, and omni-channel selling. I'm proud of how our combined organization is working together in the short time since the completion of the deal. Shifting to our balance sheet, I'm very pleased with our disciplined focus on deleveraging in the last five months.","We're committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and as I said earlier, in a little less than five months since closing the transaction, we've already reduced debt by $685 million. We expect leverage ratios to improve over time as we increase our EBITDA growth from both the realization of cost synergies and the application of the ConAgra Way to the Pinnacle portfolio. We will also continue to prioritize debt reduction in our approach to capital allocation.","I want to be clear that while we always view our portfolio with a lens toward optimizing growth and returns, we do not expect to need to make any additional divestitures in order to hit our leverage target. Looking ahead, you can be certain that we will not take our foot off the gas in the Legacy ConAgra business and we've already mobilized to aggressively apply our playbook to the Pinnacle portfolio and we'll continue to work to return those brands to growth.","Finally, we remain squarely focused on executing our margin enhancing capabilities across the entire Company. As you probably glean from my remarks so far, we've got a great Investor Day coming up in a few weeks. As I mentioned earlier, we will be going into depth on the ConAgra Way, how it has benefited Legacy ConAgra and how it's being applied to Pinnacle to build long-term sustainable growth. And while we've previewed a couple of the innovations we've been working on, there's a full slate of new products on deck that we will show you.","We'll also be sharing additional details on our Pinnacle action plan now that we've identified and begun to address the issues at hand. This will include a sneak peek of some new Pinnacle innovations that we'll be bringing to market. And finally, we will be providing updates to our financial algorithm, including new data on cost synergies. We hope that you will be able to join us in Chicago on April 10th. We're confident that the future here at ConAgra is one of long-term profitable growth. Our Q3 progress contributes to that confidence as does the long-term opportunity we'll share on April 10th.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll walk through the quarter and elements of both the Legacy ConAgra and Pinnacle businesses. With approximately two months left in fiscal 2019 and the sale of the Wesson oil business now complete, I will also share our perspectives on the balance of the year. Slide 31 outlines our performance for the quarter. Net sales for the third quarter were up 35.7% compared to a year ago, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods.","Organic net sales, excluding the effect of the sale of Trenton, were up 1.9%. Organic net sales growth was largely in line with our expectations driven by the strong performance of our Legacy ConAgra domestic retail segments, which when taken together exceeded 2.5% organic growth in the quarter. For the quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 30.5% to $781 million and adjusted gross margin declined 115 basis points to 28.9%.","While we continued to make good progress in driving Legacy ConAgra realized productivity and price mix, Pinnacle's gross margin of 26.2% in the quarter reduced total Company gross margin. In addition, the shift from A&P expense to above the line brand building investments with retailers reduced gross margin by approximately 100 basis points. I'll walk through the adjusted gross margin bridge shortly. In line with that shift, total Company A&P expense decreased 13.9% to $67 million or 2.5% of net sales in the quarter.","Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 23.4% compared to the prior year and was 10.1% of net sales. The increase was driven by the addition of Pinnacle expenses, partially offset by synergies and lower incentive compensation expense due to a lower stock price compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating profit increased 47.5% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, up 130 basis points compared to the year ago period exceeding expectations.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 35.9% to $554 million from $408 million a year ago. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.51 for the quarter, down 16.4% from the prior year. I will review the drivers of Q3 EPS performance in a moment. Slide 32 outlines the drivers of our net sales change versus the same period a year ago. Organic net sales growth ex Trenton of 1.9% reflects a 120 basis point increase in Legacy ConAgra volume.","Total price mix contributed 70 basis points as favorable price mix of 210 basis points was partially offset by increased brand building investments with retailers of 140 basis points. Total ConAgra net sales grew 35.7% driven by a 34.3% net benefit from the acquisitions of Pinnacle and Sandwich Bros., the divestiture of the Canadian Del Monte business, and our exit of the foodservice business produced in the Trenton facility. FX negatively impacted net sales by 50 basis points versus the prior year.","Slide 33 outlines our net sales performance by reporting segment. The Grocery & Snacks segment grew reported and organic net sales by 2.9% driven by continued excellent performance in the Legacy ConAgra snacks business. Net sales of snacks increased 8.2% in the quarter led by strong end market performance by Orville Redenbacher, ACT II, Snack Pack, Slim Jim, and Duke's.","The Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued its momentum in the third quarter with reported net sales growth of 3.3% and organic net sales growth of 2.4%. The acquisition of Sandwich Bros., which closed in the third quarter last year, added 90 basis points to the net sales growth. Volume grew 3.5% behind strong growth across the frozen portfolio, including Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, Banquet, P.F. Chang's, and Frontera.","The International segment's organic net sales were down 90 basis points in the quarter as favorable price mix was more than offset by volume declines concentrated in certain global export markets that benefited favorably in the prior year quarter from hurricane related shipments. Foodservice organic net sales declined 60 basis points in the quarter as the segment continued to execute its value over volume strategy. These benefits can be seen in the strong Foodservice profitability metrics I will review shortly.","Page 34 shows Q3 and implied Q4 net sales for Pinnacle versus a pro forma prior year number adjusted for ConAgra's fiscal calendar and accounting policies. For Q3, Pinnacle net sales reflects a mid-single digit percentage point decline versus the comparable year ago period on a pro forma basis. As expected, overall consumption declined during the quarter driven by Birds Eye, Wish-Bone, and Duncan Hines.","We also exited low ROI promotions. Additionally, the segment's year-over-year performance was negatively impacted by this year's later Easter holiday season. To help you better understand Pinnacles net sales on our fiscal calendar, we have included estimated Q4 Pinnacle net sales versus a pro forma prior year. We have also included additional pro forma sales detail in the appendix of today's presentation.","Moving to Slide 35, you can see that Legacy ConAgra adjusted operating profit increased 10.3% and Legacy ConAgra adjusted operating margin came in at 16.5% for the third quarter, significantly above year ago performance. Note the 326 basis point improvement in Foodservice adjusted operating margin for Q3 versus the prior year as the segment executes its value over volume strategy. The Pinnacle segment's adjusted operating profit totaled $130 million.","This performance was above expectations due to lower SG&A and approximately $12 million of synergies realized during the quarter, which were delivered ahead of schedule. The Pinnacle segment's adjusted operating margin was 18.2% or 15.6% when including the $19 million of adjusted Pinnacle general corporate expenses that had been accounted for in the Company's total corporate expenses and not in the Pinnacle reporting segment.","Total ConAgra adjusted operating profit was up 47.5% versus a year ago and adjusted operating margin was 16.3% for the third quarter, up 130 basis points. Slide 36 outlines the adjusted gross margin change for the quarter. As you can see, realized productivity and favorable price mix improved gross margin 260 basis points, more than offsetting inflation during the quarter and covering the increase in continued investments and brand building with retailers.","The gross margin of 26.2% on Pinnacle reduced overall ConAgra gross margin 100 basis points versus the prior year. Slide 37 details Pinnacle's adjusted profit margins by comparing performance this quarter to the most comparable Pinnacle Foods quarter a year ago from their earnings release, which was Pinnacle's first quarter of calendar year 2018. Pinnacle's Q3 adjusted gross margin declined 100 basis points versus this prior year comparison.","Certain Pinnacle expenses were reclassified from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform to ConAgra's accounting policies in the third quarter. Without this reclassification, Pinnacle's Q3 gross margin would have been down approximately 200 basis points. Headwinds to gross margin came from inflation on crops, packaging and transportation, increased business investments, and unfavorable volume mix and absorption. These headwinds were partially offset by continued realized productivity in the Pinnacle business.","As Sean mentioned, we are deploying the ConAgra Way to improve Pinnacle gross margins moving forward and we'll discuss this more at Investor Day. Pinnacle's adjusted operating margin, which was not impacted by the accounting reclassification, was flat year-on-year. Operating margins benefited from SG&A favorability and $12 million in synergy capture. These tailwinds offset gross margin declines and an increase in transaction related amortization.","Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS performance for the quarter versus a year ago. The bridge shows Legacy ConAgra EPS drivers followed by Pinnacle adjusted operating profit and the incremental capital costs associated with the acquisition. Starting on the left, Legacy ConAgra EPS performance was driven by increased adjusted operating profit, which was offset by lower pension and post retirement net -- non-service income due to reduced asset return assumptions related to fully funding the pension plan last year.","EPS was also reduced by lower adjusted equity method investment earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture as well as a higher Q3 adjusted effective tax rate of 24.3% versus 19.7% a year ago due to the prior year rate impact of passing tax reform. The impact of increased Pinnacle adjusted operating profit offset by higher incremental interest expense and share dilution from Pinnacle acquisition financing reduced EPS by approximately $0.08.","Slide 39 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $745 million for the 39 weeks ended Q3, down versus the prior year. This decline was all realized in the first half as Q3 cash flow was up versus Q3 in the prior year. CapEx for the 39 weeks ended Q3 was $236 million or approximately 3.4% of net sales for the same period, in line with our expectations.","In the quarter, we paid a dividend at an annualized rate of $0.85 per share. Gross debt was $11.1 billion at the end of the third quarter, a reduction of $435 million versus the end of Q2. Net debt at the end of the third quarter was $10.8 billion and the net debt leverage ratio was approximately 4.9 times on the latest 12-months pro forma EBITDA, in line with our expectations. Since the end of the third quarter through today, we have paid off another $250 million in debt.","At the end of the third quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately nine years; our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%, and total fixed rate debt approximated 83%. As of today, our variable rate term loan balance has been reduced from $1.3 billion at the end of the second quarter to $600 million. We remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and achieving our leverage ratio target of 3.5 times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA by the end of fiscal '21.","As Sean noted, we do not expect that any additional divestitures will be required for us to achieve our target leverage ratio. We believe that any further divestitures could accelerate our timetable to achieve the target ratio.","Slide 40 summarizes our updated fiscal year 2019 outlook for both the Legacy Pinnacle segment and total ConAgra inclusive of the impact of Pinnacle from the closing date of October 26, 2018 to the end of the ConAgra fiscal year on May 26, 2019. The updated organic net sales growth guidance removes Wesson for the entire fiscal year. All other metrics include Wesson's actual results only for the time period the business was owned and now exclude expected results for the remainder of the fiscal year. We expect organic net sales growth ex Trenton to be approximately 1%. We expect Pinnacle reported net sales to be within the original net sales guidance range and we've now tightened that range to $1.71 billion to $1.73 billion.","Our guidance on profit metrics is changing to reflect our ongoing real-time A&P optimization. We now expect adjusted gross margin for total ConAgra to be below the previously provided range of 29.3% to 29.6%. Again, the primary drivers of this are the continued brand building investments with retailers along with increased cost of goods sold investments to support product and packaging innovation, and higher inflation on the Pinnacle business.","Despite the lower gross margin, we expect adjusted operating margin to be above the range of 14.9% to 15.2% driven by more favorable SG&A expense as well as faster synergy capture. We are reaffirming our expectations for the effective tax rate and we now expect total Company net interest expense to be favorable and below the prior range of $390 million to $395 million as we have reduced debt ahead of our forecast. We have no change in our expected full-year share count.","We are also reaffirming our guidance range for adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.03 to $2.08. We expect our improved operating margin and lower interest expense to offset the EPS impacts of the Wesson divestiture and lower-than-expected equity method investment earnings. Finally, we expect to exceed our prior synergy target of $20 million for fiscal 2019 and we are reaffirming our expectation for transaction-related amortization. As Sean mentioned, we will provide an update on synergies at Investor Day.","Slide 41 provides a bit more detail on the organic net sales growth guidance. As I noted before, our prior guidance included Wesson for the full year. We are now excluding Wesson from our revised figure. By removing Wesson, our year-to-date organic sales growth increased by 20 basis points. Based on our performance through Q3, our guidance of approximately 1% organic net sales growth for the fiscal year excluding Wesson implies organic net sales growth of approximately 1.7% for the fourth quarter.","That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao, and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Marberger. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","The first question will be from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","This may not be the time or venue for getting into too much detail on fiscal '20 as of yet, but I guess that's obviously a key question we continue to get as folks are still uncertain, if ConAgra still needs to sort of take a step back in fiscal '20 before moving forward. I think on the December call, Sean, you talked about over delivery on synergies from Pinnacle that kind of keeps you on target for your fiscal '22 EPS target that drove the initial accretion guidance. And given this is now coming off I guess a lower fiscal '19 base, it obviously seems a bit difficult to hit that target if it all has -- if it all has to come in fiscal '21 and '22. I guess it would seem that some progress on EPS is needed in fiscal '20 to sort of be on track for that. And I'm just trying to get a sense of, even if it's broadly, am I thinking about that in the right way?","Sean Connolly","Well, you're correct. We don't give next year's guidance on our Q3 call as we've yet to review our final plan with our Board. But clearly '20 is going to be an important year for us and the building blocks for our '20 are clear. We expect momentum on Legacy ConAgra, we expect a trend bend on Pinnacle as we get into the second half, we expect strong synergy capture, and of course we expect robust deleveraging. At this point, that's about what I can give you. But you're right as well with your comments on '22, we do expect to get to a strong place. I would add it's not just on the back there of higher-than-expected synergies, it's also the recovery of the Pinnacle business through strong innovation per the comments that we had just a few minutes ago.","Andrew Lazar","And then just on -- the Pinnacle margins in the quarter came in quite a bit better than we modeled and maybe to get to even if it's the high end of Pinnacle's full-year margin target, it would suggest I guess 4Q margins would be significantly lower than what we saw in 3Q. And I guess if that's right, I'm trying to get a sense of what would drive that and I guess is that really -- do you see it as sort of a low point for Pinnacle at this stage?","Dave Marberger","Yes, Andrew. It's -- when you look at Pinnacle and you convert them from the calendar year to the ConAgra fiscal, the gross margin that they would deliver on the business has always been lower in the sort of first half of their calendar versus the second half. So because we're the May fiscal, Q3 you see lower gross margins and then same thing with Q4 so there's a seasonality aspect to that. So, you can expect to see gross margin being down a bit, which is pretty typical for their seasonality.","I think as we communicated in the second quarter, inflation has been a big impact on Pinnacle, but also the planned pricing that they had wasn't executed and then they increased pretty significantly the trade promotion to try to get the volume going again off of the lost TPD. So, we've been working through these dynamics. We have our team working with the Pinnacle team and so we feel like we're going to make progress, but it's going to take some time to get on the inflation but we're working through that.","Sean Connolly","Just to add one thing -- one additional point that, Andrew. So today's point there -- our gross margins on the Pinnacle piece of the business will vary quarter to quarter just consistent with historical norms. But make no mistake about it, the absolute gross margins on the business right now are not where they should be nor are they where they will be. But I think the bigger point on that is that in our industry, gross margin expansion really comes down to brand health. When innovation is strong, consumer pull is strong and when consumer pull is strong, elasticities of demand are low. When elasticities of demand are low, manufacturers have more pricing power and then more pricing power can lead to expanding margins. In other words, all paths lead back to doing a great job for the end consumer, which is really what the ConAgra Way is all about.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Strycula of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","So, a quick question as a follow-up to Andrew's question may be taken from a different angle, if consensus is for next year at roughly $2.17 in earnings, do you think that adequately reflects the first half\/back half dynamic where I would imagine you're still wrapping a lot of Pinnacle investment and distribution losses in the first half and then maybe things -- you have a little bit of wind in your sail for the back half? Is that directionally a fair way to think about it and does -- at a high level, do you think consensus act -- presently reflects that?","Sean Connolly","Well, I don't want to comment on consensus currently because if I do, then that's kind of the equivalent of giving fiscal '20 guidance or directionally giving guidance. But I do understand the interest in Pinnacle recovery timing because as you can imagine, we're quite interested in it as well. So, let me give you just some perspective on that because I think it's important perspective.","First off, I want everybody to know this is quite a bit different with regards to Pinnacle turnaround than what had to be done when I got to ConAgra four years ago in terms of degree of difficulty. That was a much heavier lift. The focus here with respect to Pinnacle is on executional issues on three brands. Now we do have to capture -- recapture the lost distribution points, but we have done that on many brands over the last several years by applying the ConAgra Way.","Growth always comes down to great innovation from great brands and that's what we do. The trend will bend as we get into the back half of fiscal '20 and it will get stronger from there. Beyond that, TPD strengthening on Pinnacle will be category specific and brand specific and customer specific. We have made, as I mentioned earlier, huge progress on building new innovations on the Big 3. We'll share more with you at Investor Day.","And we are working, as you might imagine, with customers to get them into the shelf resets as quickly as possible. Now obviously different customers have different windows and it also does vary by category. And as you might imagine, we are pushing for as fast as possible timing given the attractiveness of these new innovations. But in total we don't expect to see real inflection until the second half of fiscal '20 with respect to Pinnacle top line trends.","Steve Strycula","And as a quick follow-up, Sean, I appreciate your comments that ConAgra's culture is not to cut -- cost cut its way to prosperity. But how do we think about the modest reduction to the gross margin outlook in today's guidance? It seems like there's further rotation out of A&P into trade investment. Is the cost of growing in your current footprint just higher than it was before for the industry as a whole or how should investors really interpret it? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Yes, sure. Not really. As you could see in Dave's bridge, the gross margin is a function of both Pinnacle as well as the A&P shift. I think big picture we believe in brand building through effective programs that create consumer pull. We also want to do it efficiently. So accordingly, we apply a lot of analytical muscle to identify waste and then redeploy those funds to better brand building alternatives. So clearly we have identified a lot of inefficiency in A&P and a lot of opportunity with retailers, which really should not surprise anyone given the customer sophistication we see these days.","We are frankly agnostic to where we deploy marketing investments as long as they build brands effectively and we'll go much deeper on how we do this and why we do this on Investor Day. But I think the big point is overall investment is staying pretty stable, it is moving from below the line to above the line. But these A&P reductions are not being dropped to EBIT, that's the key point, nor are they being put into price discounting. They are truly going to brand building investments with retailers and much more effectively and efficiently than they were doing previously with some antiquated marketing practices below the line.","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Palmer","It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Thanks for the questions. Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of the Easter shift on sales in the third quarter for Pinnacle? I'm hoping to better understand how much of the improved growth rate indicated in the fourth quarter guidance is because top line fundamentals at Pinnacle are starting to stabilize and how much is related to that shift?","Sean Connolly","Yes. So, I would say probably about 1.5 percentage points in this quarter would be timing that will shift to next quarter.","Tom Palmer","Okay, thanks. Thanks for the color there. And then another one on fourth quarter sales line. So, you're going up against a tougher year-over-year organic sales growth comparison in the fourth quarter relative to last year. Your guidance calls for a comparable organic sales growth rate. So, what do you see as the key drivers of this growth? Are there certain key products that are accelerating from distribution gains or new product launches? Just anything to call out to kind of support that growth as you go against that tougher compare.","Sean Connolly","Sure. With respect to Q4 Legacy CAG, it's really about momentum in frozen and snacks and you saw we had very good momentum there in the third quarter as well as some very strong programming that we have planned in non-measured channels. So as we look at our forecast, that's really what's going to deliver that Q4 and we feel very good about the programs that are in the marketplace.","Operator","The next question will be from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","The first one is super short. Sean, I think you said this, but I just want to be super clear. Are you reiterating your three year synergy guidance that was given at the time of the Pinnacle deal? You did it last quarter, but I think to Andrew's question, you sort of did it; but I just want to be clear that you still believe in the accretion.","Sean Connolly","Yes. On synergies because you just used the word synergy, we baked -- what we said last quarter was we're going to beat the synergy number. We'll have more detailed color for you on that in a few weeks. With respect to strong EPS performance through '22, yes, we expected last quarter that we would have strong EPS performance through '22 and basically get to roughly where we wanted to get to all along. Anyway, we still see that.","And as I said last quarter, we're going to get there from a lower base. We won't get there on a straight line, but we will get there and we'll get there through a combination of higher than expected synergies and profit and margin recovery on the Pinnacle business while continuing to do what we expect with the Legacy ConAgra business.","David Driscoll","And I did mean the accretion synergies just being a component of it. Thank you for the clarification. Second question for me is on your price mix. Total Company price mix 0.7%, but the retailer investment is a big number, 1.4 points of investments with those retailers. How do you see the pricing environment? You were clear on multiple points in your script about what strong brands can do for you in terms of margins and pricing. But just today's report 0.7 points, when I just look at that aggregated number, it looks OK. But I would like to hear how you interpret this and think about that retailer investment? Do you just add it back and look at the 2.1 points of price mix and say that that is the better indicator of how well your brands are responding to the need for pricing?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I think it's a better indicator. But you also have to keep in mind too, David, what we're doing here is really refreshing and premiumizing the portfolio. So, a big driver for our entire Company is just massive contemporarization through innovation. And when we do that contemporarization through innovation; we bring premiumization, we bring higher price points and ideally higher gross margin percentages.","So, I pointed out last year as a good example on our frozen business, we basically restaged the entire frozen business with more premium products and much of the pricing we got through there was through that premiumization and just total overhaul of the business. There are other categories where we do it the old fashioned way and we just take inflation just by list price increases.","Most recent one of those is tomatoes, which is a business where we've experienced significant inflation on canned tomatoes. We knew that it would take a while for our competition to follow, but in Q3 we took pricing anyway. It suppressed our sales a little bit on that business, but now we're seeing the kind of competitive response we expected all along and that's the right decision for the long haul.","So, we're going to continue to get pricing a variety of ways. I think everybody is kind of in that ballpark these days. But in our case since we had so much refreshing to do with the portfolio, probably more of it than you see on average has been coming through this pretty wholesale innovation play that we've been driving.","David Driscoll","Dave, can I just ask one clarification to one of the numbers on top line? So in the year ago period, there was an effect from the hurricanes and shifting of inventories or shipments between quarters. Was that a benefit in this quarter and can you quantify it?","Dave Marberger","So David, it was really in the Grocery & Snacks reporting segment. We had -- if you kind of parse that, we had snacks which basically shipped to consumption as we showed strong 8% basically consumption and shipments. On the grocery side, there was a little bit of a bump because we did ship above consumption in the quarter in grocery so there was a little bit of a benefit there about 50 basis points year-on-year on that.","Sean Connolly","But I think the one thing that Dave mentioned before too is you see some of the -- you see some of the negative results in International. International actually benefited in the year ago quarter from hurricane shipments and some of the protracted problems happened in the island. So that actually represented a headwind this quarter and speaks to the decline that you see in the International piece.","So, there's -- you got a bit of different noise in different operating segments, but I guess overall the net top line performance has been pretty consistent with what we expected. And overall over time, we genuine -- generally usually see shipments and consumption operate very, very closely together with little spread.","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","So, I just had a question about really the optimization piece of the strategy. If you go back and look at what you did with ConAgra really legacy frozen portfolio. First, you saw some distribution weaknesses -- sorry distribution weakness and then velocities improved, but then we also started to see after that distribution gains. So if we step back and just think about only Pinnacle that we're seeing, as you said, and parts of the International business, TDPs may have come off, right, but velocities start to improve which is a positive. But when you think about the overall portfolio with Pinnacle and you speak with the retailers, I'm assuming that's really just like the first piece of the broader strategy which is improve the portfolio, improve the velocities, and then go back and get the distribution and then grow the margin. So just kind of want to -- any color as to kind of how you think about that longer-term strategy to get back to distribution gains with better velocities?","Sean Connolly","Yes. This -- you are spot on and we're going to spend a fair amount of time kind of walking you through how this works, you can call it the ConAgra Way, because it is -- it's very process oriented, it's very principle based, it's very repeatable and scalable. And basically the philosophy behind it says hey, you've got to have a solid foundation in the marketplace on which to build. So, step one is the value over volume strategy and it does create that solid foundation. Then you layer very provocative high velocity innovation on top of that and you support it and if the product is designed the right way, you get good repeat.","So, it does become a virtuous cycle and that is really the model that we try to get in there and it starts with a very clear eyed assessment around what's in the marketplace and is it fully competitive versus the other stuff consumers could buy. And when businesses kind of run into executional challenges or they take their foot off the gas on innovation, it's not surprising to find that what's in the marketplace is not always fully competitive and you have to deal with that and that's exactly our approach.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, super. And then just quickly on the retailer investments and I realize it's always a sensitive topic to kind of get in the exact examples. But just given I feel like you've spent a little bit more in the trade for a while, but kind of the theme continues to evolve in that area. Can you just give any incremental color as to exactly what you do? I mean I think I know what you do, but kind of just to clarify.","Sean Connolly","I think the easiest way to describe it -- the easy way to describe it, Rob, is kind of what is and what was. What was in the old days, you'd go to customers and -- as a manufacturer with a bag of money and most of that money went into price based merchandising events. Now those could be very, very inefficient just rollbacks on the shelf. That was kind of the bottom feeder merchandising event. Then there was end aisle displays, that was kind of next up.","And then there were the combination of in-store flyers plus displays and those usually got the best lifts. And over time what we saw is that young consumers were less and less responsive to price based discounting. They wanted more than a cheap price. They wanted higher quality. They didn't care if our Banquet Salisbury Steak was $0.88 if a Banquet Salisbury Steak was the last thing that their stomach craved. So these lifts dropped, at the same time our retailers began to become much more sophisticated because after all they sit on a couple of important things.","One is a massive amount of high quality consumer data that allows targeting and personalization of marketing message. The other thing that they have is scale. So even today, as an example, we are seeing big retailers starting to realize they have major buying power when it comes to traditional marketing services like advertising, in some cases much more buying power than manufacturers of their own right. So they are increasingly becoming a high effectiveness, high efficiency conduit to the consumer.","And so as we agnostically look at deploying brand building marketing, all we really care about is who's the best conduit to deliver high impact, high efficiency brand building activities to the consumer. And it is absolutely becoming clear that the customer is becoming a better and better conduit for effectiveness and efficiency in brand building year in, year out and if you look at the assets they sit on between things like scale as well as data, it shouldn't be really surprising to anybody, very different from historical mental models, but clear empirical evidence that it's more effective.","Operator","The next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","So we were talking a little bit ago about the consistency, I guess, on the consumer takeaway data versus the reported data in grocery and refrigerated. I'm curious about the frozen area. This quarter you reported 4.9% organic net sales growth in the frozen area. I think on the next page in the presentation, the consumer takeaway data this quarter was 2.6% so there was a positive gap. Was that a one-time inventory rebuild? We've heard some companies talk about extension of payment terms. Just curious about what's driven that and whether it could continue going forward, maybe it's a non-measured channel. Thank you.","Sean Connolly","It's a very good question, Alexia. A little bit of it is non-measured channels, but as I mentioned last quarter, there were some shipments that slid from late Q2 into early Q3, which is not unusual at all around the holidays. So for example, Marie Callender desert pies, that's an example of a business where we saw some shipments slide around the holidays and that's why we get kind of -- we try not to give quarterly guidance on top line because we can't exactly control when these shipments leave the docks and when they're received by customers especially when you've got major holiday events going on in things like pies. But that's a piece of it. I think the bigger point in Q3 was that consumer takeaway and the underlying fundamentals were quite strong and that does include, to your point, very strong performance in unmeasured channels. So overall, we were quite pleased not just in frozen, but with what we saw in other areas as well.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","This is a question for Dave. Dave, I think on the last call you talked about having contingency plans for CapEx in relation to hitting debt targets longer term. I didn't hear anything about the CapEx guide this year. Is it unchanged and maybe you could put a number? And then just broadly speaking, it seems like Pinnacle does need some investment in growth CapEx for coming up with carbohydrate substitutes and that requires some capacity. So, how can I reconcile those two things or is it possible to do everything while reducing CapEx?","Dave Marberger","No. Good question and so let me be clear. When I talk about managing CapEx, in no way am I talking about cutting investment that's going to drive the business. When I make a comment like that, I'm clearly talking about just managing the timing of CapEx. That's normal kind of management of investment that I've done my entire career and every company does. So, I just want to be crystal clear on that point. Our CapEx year-to-date is about 3.6% of net sales.","We've said between 3% and 4% would be kind of our rate so I think we could kind of assume that it will stay in that range for the fiscal year. So -- but they're really the kind of key drivers there. But we are making investments in the business, we're doing it now, we're going to continue to do it, and we're going to manage our cash at the same time. So, we're on target there.","Sean Connolly","One other thought on that, Rob, too as well. We have existing capabilities and capital in place that we have leverage to drive innovation on Legacy ConAgra that has excess capacity and can be readily applied to some of the Pinnacle brands.","For example, Birds Eye is a -- it's clearly our biggest brands and it is a business that historically was not able to get into the world of single-serve and we have industry leading single-serve capability and there -- some very unique aspect to that. That's turnkey. So we can apply that pretty quickly in a capital efficient way and drive growth and ideally margin accretion.","Robert Moskow","You haven't said much about -- today about carbohydrate substitutes, but it was a big part of your comments in December how you -- how that was what Birds Eye missed. Are we going to hear more about that in April or is it kind of something that gets pushed back longer because of co-packing needs?","Sean Connolly","No, we'll talk quite a bit in April about not only Birds Eye, but really the rest of the Company. But as when I referred in my comments today around opting out of very important consumer growth sites and dig sites, clearly the big one on Birds Eye was the spiralized piece and that's just an area that the leading brand in the category has to be in. So, you should assume that that's coming from us and we'll have lot more to say about that in a few weeks.","Operator","The next question will be from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","A couple of questions. First, it's great to see some of the Pinnacle Foods innovation already. Can you give us a sense of when you -- when we should start to expect to see some of that show up at retail?","Sean Connolly","Yes. That's really the point I was making earlier, which is we -- number one, we did really put the pedal down to build this innovation out and it has been for me personally just incredibly impressive to see what the team has done so quickly. Just because we've designed it and built it doesn't mean it's ready to start showing up in the scanner data because it's not on the shelf and so our job is to try to get it on the shelf as quickly as possible. That's sometimes easier said than done because customers do plan out their innovation pipe oftentimes a year in advance, sometimes they go 18 months in advance, and there is an element of hey, get in the queue here to do this.","That said, because we're talking about brands like Birds Eye which is really a juggernaut an industry leader in the category; we're not talking that far out. We're working to get our products into these planograms as soon as we can. Some customers will try to shoot one in sooner, some will come later; but it will be category by category, customer by customer. But in total, my expectation is that we won't see a material bend in the trend until the back half of fiscal '20 and it should get stronger from there.","Jason English","And I wanted to come back to Andrew Lazar's question on Pinnacle Food margins because I don't think I was fully sated by the answer. If I've done the math correct, I think the implicit EBIT margin in the fourth quarter for PF is 9%, which is quite a big sequential step down, right. And I heard your messaging on gross margins, but the messaging there didn't seem to suggest that we would see such a dramatic drop in gross margin. So my takeaway is there must be something else going on. A, is my math, right; and B, what is -- if there is something else going on, what is it? And should we be bracing for that sort of exit rate for this year to be the entry rate into 2020?","Dave Marberger","Yes. Jason, this is Dave. I'm not quite getting the -- did you say 9% operating margin, is that what you said for Pinnacle?","Jason English","Yes, yes. That's...","Dave Marberger","Yes, it's not quite that low. You'll see gross margin come down a bit from where we are in Q3 from what I described earlier, but we're north of your number on operating margin.","Jason English","Okay. I'll revisit our math and follow up if necessary.","Dave Marberger","Okay.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Brian Kearney for his closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","Thank you. So as a reminder, this call has been recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our press release. The Investor Relations team is available for any follow-up discussions that anyone may have. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra Brands.","Operator","Thank you.

This program is being recorded.","My name is Candice Griffin and I will be your conference facilitator. All audience lines are currently in a listen-only mode. However, our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the formal question-and-answer session.","At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m Gary Rodkin here with John Gehring our CFO, Tom McGough, President of Consumer Foods; Paul Maass, President of Private Brands and Commercial Foods; and Chris Klinefelter, our VP of Investor Relations. We also have our CEO-elect, Sean Connolly with us today as well.","Before we get started, Chris has a few words.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements and while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our Company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which includes cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks Chris. As you can see from the release, comparable EPS came in higher than our most recent projections and we've raised our full year outlook. Additionally, we're on track for our debt reduction commitment. So there is fair amount to discuss in today's remarks.","But before we get into the specifics of that, I want to introduce Sean Connolly, our incoming CEO. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the selection of Sean. He is sharp, seasoned, enthusiastic, and he refuses to lose. His energy and focus will serve ConAgra Foods well and he is making a terrific first impression here at ConAgra Foods.","I know many of you know him and I am confident you'll enjoy interacting with him in the months and years ahead. Sean?","Sean Connolly","Thanks Gary and good morning, everyone.","I am looking forward to transitioning into the CEO role here in a couple of weeks. I am very excited to be at ConAgra Foods and part of this team. This is a highly motivated organization with great brands, strong product lines and incredible people and I believe there is a lot we can do to create value together.","Now I imagine many of you have big picture questions about our strategy and goals. We'll get to those over time, but not today. I'll need a lot of study to get where I need to be to provide insight on this. For now, I'll just say that I am committed to long term value creation as is our Board of Directors.","My plan is to spend the coming months digging in and learning everything I can about our company. After that, we'll share our thinking with all of you at an investor event when the time is right. To be clear, that will be several months down the road.","Until then, our organization will remain focused on delivering our near term commitments and our key business initiatives. I look forward to working with all of you as we take ConAgra Foods to the next level.","As many of you know I value a good dialogue with analyst and investors and I believe in transparency and availability, so that you can have a very solid understanding of our plans.","Thanks for your time this morning. I appreciate your interest in ConAgra Foods and I look forward to working with all of you.","Now I\u2019ll hand it back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks, John. Now let\u2019s focus on the company's third quarter results.","I\u2019m going to briefly touch on some overall remarks about the quarter and then ask Tom McGough and Paul Maass to offer some commentary about our segments.","Given that this is my last earnings call and the fact that I\u2019m retiring from my role officially in a couple of weeks, I think it makes sense for Tom and Paul, who are running the segments day-to-day to offer the more detailed remarks about segment performance. So you\u2019ll hear from them in a minute.","Our third quarter comparable EPS was $0.59, that\u2019s ahead of our most recent expectations and below our comparable EPS of $0.62 a year ago. All of our segments ended up ahead of what we were planning, when we offered our last guidance and we also got some EPS help from lower taxes and higher joint venture earnings.","We've refined our view of the year and have taken our outlook up accordingly and we're confident we'll meet our debt reduction commitment.","We saw comparable profit growth for both Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods during the third quarter, despite some headwinds that impacted us. To state the obvious, our Private Brand segment continues to be below expectations and our revised outlook for that segment has driven a lot of impairment charge.","Obviously we\u2019re very disappointed with our Private Brands' results thus far and we're taking specific actions to improve it. At the same time, most of the company the two biggest segments are performing well and delivering on commitments.","Our Consumer Food segment has grown profits each quarter this fiscal year and we're gradually making progress on the topline with share gains and volume holding steady.","Commercial Foods led by Lamb Weston continues to make progress on both the top and bottom-line as it gains new business domestically to make up for some headwinds including the West Coast Port slowdown, which has impacted international sales over the near term. So the good news is that most of the company is on track and Paul and Tom will give you some specific examples.","In addition to this, we remain highly focused on a more efficient organization at all levels. That's important fuel for ongoing business growth but along with the progress we\u2019re making across the company, we continue to have a challenged private brands performance.","While our learning curve has been steep and taken longer than plan, we\u2019re in the midst of implementing very granular initiatives to significantly improve execution. These initiatives should help our customer service, customer relationships and in due time our ultimate performance.","Our initiatives will also help us to manage cost more effectively. You\u2019ll hear more about that from Paul in a minute. We expect better results from the Private Brands segment in fiscal '16.","Now on to more specifics by segment, I\u2019ll ask Tom and Paul to offer their thoughts so, Tom?","Tom McGough","Thanks Gary and good morning everyone. This is Tom McGough, President of Consumer Foods.","I'll begin by highlighting that we're delivering on our plans for this year, which focused on improving share, stabilizing volume and growing profit.","We planned for a year of foundation building in Consumer Foods and I\u2019m pleased with our progress despite operating in a challenging marketplace. For the third quarter, Consumer Foods posted a 2% net sales decline with flat volume, a 1% decline in price mix and a negative 1% impact from FX. Comparable operating profit increased 5%.","Importantly, we extended our shared leadership in frozen single-serve meals during the quarter, a position we first took over earlier this fiscal year.","That leadership position is driven by the ongoing sales and share growth from the re-calendar single-serve meals, a brand where we've had an effective strategy and the right fundamentals, which has enabled us to invest to grow.","Also within frozen we successfully restaged the P.F. Chang's brand by investing in renovating the core meal segment and introducing new appetizers and side dishes in the fall. We're seeing very good results.","In the center of the store, we\u2019re also seeing growth in PAM and Reddi-wip, again behind the right strategies and strong fundamentals with consistent investment. On Reddi-wip, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter. Reddi-wip is now the number one whipped topping outselling all frozen and refrigerated competitors.","Finally Slim Jim continues to be a strong and consistent performer. We're taking share and growing sales. We're also making progress on the three big brands we've been working to stabilize this year. Chef Boyardee continues to improve growing volume year-over-year behind packaging improvements and effective promotion strategies.","Healthy Choice is growing dollar share in the nutritional meals segment behind our continued focus on building Caf\u00e9 Steamers. We\u2019ve added a new line called Simply Steamers, which I\u2019ll say more about in a minute. Simply Steamers is performing well and helping us to improve our margins.","Finally Orville Redenbacher's is making sequential improvement by getting the fundamentals right namely simplifying the packaging graphics and improving product assortment on shelf. This is work in process as retailers will be resetting the shelves over the next several months. It is already working in those retailers who we have fully implemented the improvements.","We made progress on these three brands of the first three quarters and we expect to continue -- we expect to see continued progress until fiscal '16.","While this is a challenging environment, there is growth in our industry. I\u2019d like to share a bit more about how we\u2019re positioning our brands for the long term to capitalize on the consumer, customer and shopper trends that are driving growth.","First as we shared in previous conversations, we're already redirecting resources to faster growing retail channels and that strategy is working. We're now outpacing the growth rate in Club, Dollar and Convenient channels. We will continue investing here, getting at least our fair share of growth in the stronger channel and these stronger performing channels on an ongoing basis.","Second, we're addressing the consumer desire for more transparency and authenticity. You\u2019ve heard a lot about this lately as most of our industry has acknowledged the need do more to be more relevant with today's consumer. The good news here is we\u2019ve product lines in our portfolio that epitomize simple and wholesome like Heinz Tomatoes and many others that also fit with today\u2019s consumer.","For example, Healthy Choice, Simply Steamers is an example of that. With some straightforward packaging and ingredient changes such as moving to all natural protein and no artificial ingredients we hit the sweet spot of what consumer's desire.","The initial end market performance of these entrees is a great sign of what we can do within this portfolio to resonate better with consumers. Finally, we know that when people to turn to packaged food, they expect convenience. The convenience part has been raised and we\u2019re responding making changes easier for the consumer and shopper can mean a variety of things.","Sometimes it\u2019s about improving packaging to make it more convenient or might mean thinking about an entire product line differently like we did with P.F. Chang's. We looked at convenience from a time track shopper point of view and marketing the line of appetizers, meals and rice together as a complete meal, has had very good result so far.","The takeaway here is that our Consumer Food business has strong strategies for growth. These strategies direct our resources toward the best opportunities to win and leverage our capabilities well.","Before I finish my remarks on Consumer Foods, I\u2019ll note that the comparable 5% earning profit growth, 5% operating growth shows our productivity and efficiencies are coming in strong.","Our operating profit growth includes the fact that we had to deal with the hedging issue and the impact of an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Despite those external headwinds, we grew profit largely because we managed our supply chain very well and reap the benefits of those efficiencies.","Advertising expense declined approximately $20 million in the quarter. We're planning A&P to be up in the fourth quarter. In conclusion, on Consumer Foods, our game plan for the year was to grow share, stabilize volume and grow profit. We're delivering on that.","I look forward to your questions in a few minutes and for now I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul Maass for comments on the private brand and commercial segments.","Paul Maass","Thanks Tom. Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Paul Maass and I'll first focus on our Private Brand segment.","For profits were well below a year ago amounts as we noted in our February update. We\u2019re in a highly competitive bidding environment, seen some category softness and dealing with high input costs, specifically in pasta. We've also experienced execution shortfalls. Those factors have negatively impacted recent results and near-term expectations for volumes, pricing and margins.","We've reassessed the timing and slope of recovery in our private brand segment and concluded that significant improvement in our top and bottom performance will take longer than we previously expected.","We're very focused on implementing significant changes to improve execution, strength in customer relationships and improve our performance. We've made positive changes already with more to come. Those changes will continue to be implemented over the next several quarters and we expect to improve results in fiscal '16.","Even with those improvements coming down the road, clearly our view of future performance is well below previous projections and expectations, which has resulted in the impairment. John will say more about the impairment in his remarks.","As I look at the underlying issues in the business there are a few things that count more than others. The level of competitor fragmentation and capacity in the marketplace means that every dollar won in this business is hard fought. We know that speed and agility are hallmarks of Private Brands and are key to winning.","Focusing on the distinct needs of our six business units within Private Brands is a must. For example what it takes to win in pasta is simply different from crackers and the winning priorities in crackers are different from snack nuts and so on.","We're strengthening our focus and specialized capabilities and we're leveraging our scale where it makes sense. Scale is clearly a strength of ours, but that's obviously not been enough to win in the market place. Having learned some lessons the hard way, we're better equipped to have the right processes and structure to win going forward.","We know too well, that the decline in this business has experienced is unacceptable and we're in the midst of stabilizing it so the business can return to growth in fiscal '16. The stabilization and turnaround plan is focused on four executional areas that we highlighted a few months back.","We had just defined these focus areas then and we've accomplished a lot in three months in terms of rewiring processes and better defining our priorities.","First, we're further narrowing the focus of our sales teams for deeper expertise and capability, which enables decision making closer to our customer, improve speed and reduces complexity.","In the Private Brands business in particular, we see the need for simplified processes, they efficiently handle the large volume of work coming from a big number of customer specific skews.","Our customers value and appreciate supplier partners. We have deep product knowledge, category by category, customer by customer. This kind of focus has worked well for us prior to acquiring Ralcorp and it can work for us again.","Second, we're beginning to improve our commercialization process by eliminating bottlenecks and getting new products on shelf when our customers expect them. With such a large volume of work, we've to be extremely efficient in our responsiveness to customer request for product modifications, most notably graphics changes. We've already taken, we've started this process and we're looking forward to further improvement.","Third we are establishing better and more consistent customer service capabilities. While this area has been improving for some time, we're now focusing on the aspects that make the right service levels and fill rates sustainable over time.","As we consolidate our manufacturing network, we're improving our execution to ensure dependable, uninterrupted supply. As you would expect, fill rates and on-time delivery are extremely sensitive to retailers in a way that is very different within our branded business. We're talking about their products under their brand names and there is no substituting another product. So we're positioning our teams to consistently meet and exceed our customer's expectation.","Fourth, we're focused on margin management. We're going at this in a number of ways including improved pricing execution to better linkage of our input cost and risk management to pricing decisions and better visibility into new product and promotional effectiveness. This allows us to leverage mix as a margin enhancer as well.","Tighter and stronger connectivity among our field, our general management and our supply chain teams is key and will help us improve our margins. These improvement initiatives have begun and they will continue driving improvement starting in '16.","Ultimately, these are significant changes that are intended to improve execution, strengthen our customer relationships and improve our performance. To sum up those improvement areas, these are basic foundational elements in our Private Brands business.","For us to be seen as a true value added partner, we have to improve speed, agility and consistency. I want to be very clear, we\u2019re fundamentally changing the way we operate this business to succeed in the marketplace over time and create stronger results but we realize, this will not be a quick turnaround.","Now moving on to Commercial Foods, sales were 1%, compared to a year ago and comparable operating profit increased 4%. In our biggest business and the segment Lamb Weston, sales and profits were up slightly this quarter.","The big news here is that we were able to drive some top and bottom line growth, despite been negatively impacted by the West Coast port labor slowdown that had a significant impact on our third quarter volume and profit. We\u2019re pleased the port situation is resolved, but it will take a bit of time to recover from it due to the backlog of product.","Business for Lamb Weston domestically is very strong. We\u2019ve added to and diversified our customer base and we\u2019re processing a crop that is better than last year\u2019s, which is positively impacting our earnings delivery.","Our international performance for the quarter was below a year ago due to the West Coast port slowdown despite that emerging markets are an extremely valuable part of the long-term picture.","Result for other Commercial Foods businesses were above a year ago and we\u2019re pleased with their performances. These are well run businesses with focused agendas that are consistently delivering.","Outside of our segments, we continue to see good results that are classified within equity method investment earnings. Joint ventures are a very important component of our Commercial Foods businesses and we\u2019re pleased with the strong results from our joint ventures this quarter and fiscal year.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks John, and Paul.","As you can see, there are bright spots within the company. And it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fact that our overall effectiveness and efficiency work is doing what it is supposed to.","This is taking place throughout ConAgra Foods and is producing the SG&A savings and productivity we envisioned, which of course plays a big role in our company\u2019s broader goals. Importantly, the execution related initiatives underway in Private Brands will help us stabilize and grow over time.","Our most recent results have been weighted down by our Private Brands performance. But when I take a step back, I\u2019m extremely pleased to see the progress our team has made over the last decade. The long-term view shows, we made good progress transforming ConAgra Foods' into a true operating company with an engaged culture. All of that also tells us that we\u2019re in a position to profitably grow on a sustainable basis over the years ahead.","Getting ConAgra Foods to this point has required significant energy and dedication from thousands of people inside the company. I want to thank my team, including all ConAgra Foods employees for all of the sweat equity, talent and perseverance they\u2019ve devoted to ConAgra Foods. It means a lot to me personally and to all of our stakeholders and it's why the company is set up well for the future.","I also want to thank you and the rest of the investment community for the interest you had in our company during my tenure here. I\u2019ve appreciated our interactions and your feedback throughout the years and I wish you all the best.","I've truly enjoyed the candid dialogue, the challenges and good exchange of ideas that I\u2019m sure will continue with Sean.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John for some additional detail.","John Gehring","Thank you Gary and good morning everyone. I have several topics to cover this morning. I\u2019ll start with some comments on our fiscal third quarter performance including the additional impairment charge in our Private Brand segment this quarter.","Next I\u2019ll cover comparability matters, then on to cash flow, capital and balance sheet items and finally I\u2019ll provide some comments on our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.","Let\u2019s start with our performance. Overall the fiscal third quarter comparable results were better than our revised expectations, reflecting a strong close to the quarter in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Food segments and lower tax rate.","But also continuing challenges in our Private Brand segment. Before I cover some of the details, I would remind everyone that the results of the ConAgra meals business prior to the formation of the Ardent Mills joint venture in the first fiscal quarter are reflected as discontinued operations.","And our share of earnings from our 44% interest in Ardent Mills is included in equity method investment earnings.","For the fiscal third quarter, we reported net sales of $3.9 billion, about 2% below the year ago quarter. We reported a loss per share from continuing operations of $2.23 versus earnings of $0.52 per share in the year ago period. The sharp decline in reported EPS was driven by a non-cash impairment charge that I will say more about in a few minutes.","Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share were $0.59, about 5% below comparable year ago amounts, principally reflecting weaker performance in our Private Brands segment and higher corporate expenses, offset by stronger performance in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments.","The fiscal third quarter comparable earnings include approximately $28 million of losses related to certain index hedges. Due to changes in correlations among commodities and these hedges, the company changes its method or recognizing the related mark-to-market amounts.","As such, the company has recognized approximately $28 million of expense directly to its operating segments this quarter. Without this change in methodology, most of that expense would have been temporarily classified within unallocated corporate expense and recognized within segment results over the next few quarters. The $28 million of expense is not identified as an item impacting comparability.","Now I'll share a few comments on our segment performance. Starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $1.8 billion, down about 2% from the year ago period, reflecting flat volume, a 1% decline in price mix and a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $282 million or up about 5% from the year ago period. The operating profit reflects the improving volume trends and lower marketing and SG&A costs. Gross margins were down slightly as the benefits of pricing, mix improvement and cost savings were offset by a mark-to-market on the aforementioned index hedge derivatives of approximately $21 million.","Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $17 million on net sales and about $8 million on operating profit for the segment for this fiscal quarter.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results. This quarter, cost savings were approximately $70 million and largely offset inflation of about 4%. Inflation was driven by cost increases on certain inputs, particularly proteins.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $81 million, down about 20% from the prior year quarter, due in part to changes in timing between the third and fourth quarters.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1 billion or up about 1% from the prior year quarter. Results were driven by a 2% volume increase, primarily reflecting the increased domestic sales in our potato business.","The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $145 million or 4% above the comparable operating profit in the year ago period. The operating profit increase principally reflects the benefits from increased domestic volumes and the improved quality crop in Lamb Weston, offset by lower international volumes including the impacts from the West Coast port labor dispute.","Our Private Brands segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1 billion, down about 5% from the prior year quarter driven by a 7% volume decline, resulting from execution shortfalls and pressures from both branded and private branded competitors.","Operating profit excluding items impacting comparability was approximately $37 million, down 44% from the prior year quarter. This decline reflects the weak volume performance and margin compression driven by supply chain execution challenges and lower overhead absorption.","The performance and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year also reflect additional margin pressures from rapid increases in several key commodity inputs particularly tree nuts and durum wheat.","Given the segment's recent poor performance and continued execution challenges, particularly the issues that we experienced over the last fiscal quarter, we have reassessed the nature and extent of the executional challenges across all elements of this segment as well as our estimates of how long it will take for our recovery plan to positively impact the financial performance of the businesses in this segment.","Due to the significant shortfall in the profit and cash flow performance in our private brand segment and our significantly lower expectations relative to the timing of improvement and cash flows in this segment over the next several years, we have updated our goodwill impairment analysis.","As a result, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $1.3 billion or $1.2 billion after-tax. These charges are principally related to the impairment of goodwill, but also includes some small impairment charges related to certain brand or trademark assets in the Private Brands segment.","The additional impairment is driven by the significant change in our performance outlook and reflects the fact that the underlying discounted cash flow valuation models are very sensitive to changes in near term cash flow and growth assumptions.","Notwithstanding the setbacks in our Private Brand segment this year, we continue to believe that we will see improvement in the margin structure of this business going forward as we improve our execution, especially related to customer service, pricing and margin management and as we complete supply chain initiatives that are driving some higher costs in the near-term.","Moving on to corporate expenses, for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $50 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $51 million versus $29 million in the year ago quarter.","The increase versus last year's third quarter reflects a shift in timing between quarters for some expenses and higher benefit and incentive accruals this year. Equity method investment earnings were higher this quarter due to the addition of earnings from the Ardent Mills joint venture.","Next, I'll move on to items impacting comparability. Overall we have approximately $2.82 per diluted share of net expense and the quarter's reported EPS related to several items. As previously discussed, we recorded $1.3 billion or $2.81 per share of non-cash charges related to goodwill and other intangible impairments in our Private Brand segment.","On hedging for the fiscal third quarter, the net hedging gain included in corporate expenses was approximately $6 million or $0.01 per share. Next, we recorded approximately $22 million or $0.03 per share of net expense related to integration and restructuring costs. Also in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized a tax benefit of $3 million or approximately $0.01 per share related to favorable adjustments of prior year federal income tax credits.","As a housekeeping detail, I will point out that our comparable EPS of $0.59 excludes the $0.01 benefit to GAAP EPS resulting from their requirement to use weighted average basic outstanding shares to calculate EPS when there is a loss.","Now I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $137 million of cash on hand and $436 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings.","We're targeting operating cash flows of approximately $1.55 billion for fiscal 2015, down modestly from our previous estimate, due in part to higher projected yearend inventory levels related to certain crop based inputs and higher cost for certain raw material inventories. We still expect to have ample cash to achieve our fiscal 2015 debt repayment target.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $116 million versus $133 million in the prior year quarter. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $500, somewhat lower than our previous estimate.","Net interest expense was $80 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $95 million in the year ago quarter. Dividends for this fiscal quarter were $107 million versus $105 million in the year ago quarter.","On capital allocation as we have previously noted, our capital allocation priority through fiscal year 2015 will be the repayment of debt. By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to have repaid around $2 billion of debt since the Ralcorp acquisition, including $1 billion this fiscal year.","We have repaid slightly over $600 million to date this year including $500 million from proceeds related to the Ardent Mills transaction. We remain committed to a strong dividend and intend to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we de-lever.","While we continue to limit our share repurchases, this quarter we did repurchase about 38 million shares -- $38 million of shares. And, while we expect limited acquisition activity in the near-term, we will continue to evaluate investments to strengthen our performance.","As we enter fiscal 2016 with a stronger balance sheet, we expect to have more flexibility in our capital allocation to consider dividend increases, share repurchases and additional growth investments in addition to debt repayment.","This quarter, we did announce plans to add production capacity to support growth in our Lamb Weston\/Meijer joint venture in Europe. This expansion will not require a capital contribution from the partners as it will be financed by the joint venture.","Now I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our fiscal 2015 outlook. For fiscal 2015, we now expect diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability to be in the range of $2.15 to $2.19 per share. This is slightly higher than our recent estimate as we have passed along some of our third quarter over delivery that was made possible by a lower tax rate.","Our current full year guidance reflects our view of several key performance factors, including the following, continued good execution in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Food segment. In our Private Brand segment, we expect volumes and profits to be down year-over-year reflecting the challenges we have discussed and our reassessment of the timing and pace of improvements in volume and operating margins in this business.","We also continue to expect higher equity method investment earnings due to the contribution from Ardent Mills. As a reminder, while we\u2019re off to a good start and remain confident that over time Ardent Mills will be accretive to our earnings, there is about $0.08 of EPS dilution included in our fiscal 2015 outlook. Equity method investment earnings in total are expected to be in the range of $120 million for the full fiscal year.","Overall while we still have more work to improve the performance in our Private Brand segment, we have made good progress against key initiatives in many areas of our business in fiscal 2015, including Consumer Foods, Commercial Foods, corporate and SG&A expense control and our Ardent Mills joint venture.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass will be happy to take your questions.","I\u2019ll now turn it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everyone.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning, Andrew.","John Gehring","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Welcome Sean, great to hear from you again and Gary, really wishing you all the best moving forward.","Sean Connolly","Thank you.","Andrew Lazar","I guess there are two questions from me if I could. First Sean, this may not be a question you\u2019re prepared to answer really just yet, but you\u2019ll tell me if that\u2019s the case, I guess if we had asked you and maybe prior roles that you had in food, Cannibal, Hillshire and such realizing this may ultimately be a very different outcome as it relates specifically to ConAgra.","Trying to get a sense of what would your thoughts have been regarding sort of the marriage if you will of Private Label and Brands under the same roof, because there\u2019s still obviously quite a bit of investor skepticism around the pairing and then I just got a follow-up?","Sean Connolly","Well I appreciate the question Andrew and I appreciate that you all have many questions for me about how we\u2019re going to create value going forward, clearly being just a few weeks in to ConAgra Foods here, I am in the early days of learning and I\u2019ve got a lot more work to do.","So I\u2019m not in a position today to give you the kind of perspective that you\u2019re seeking but I do look forward to engaging with you down the road and sharing that perspective because I\u2019ll have it. For now, just know that I do see tremendous opportunity to create value here at ConAgra Foods and I\u2019m really happy to be part of the team.","Andrew Lazar","Got it, understood and then Paul, I realize ConAgra won\u2019t give full year sort of '16 guidance really until next quarter. The Private Brands margin I think around 3.7% was maybe the lowest since ConAgra\u2019s owned it.","Are we able to say maybe at this stage though that this is sort of a bottom on margins for this unit or giving visibility is still sufficiently murky that we can\u2019t quite say that yet as we think out to 2016 specifically in Private Brands. Thanks very much.","Paul Maass","You bet, yeah I would say yeah we\u2019re clearly disappointed with where we\u2019re at and we do intend to deliver profit growth in '16 and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all focused on doing.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Paul Maass","You bet.","Operator","We\u2019ll move now to David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll","Thank you and good morning.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning David.","John Gehring","Good morning, David.","David Driscoll","Gary, thanks for everything, I really appreciate it and good luck with your retirement and future activities and Sean, welcome back.","Sean Connolly","Thanks David.","Gary Rodkin","Thank you.","David Driscoll","So guys way kind of a game changing event yesterday with Kraft and Heinz and Gary, Sean I don\u2019t know what you want to comment or not but Gary, gosh you\u2019ve been at this a long time. You started at ConAgra, was a decentralized structure, your first action was to turn ConAgra into I think the annual report said one turn, it into one entity.","I feel like the ZBB actions and the elimination of so much internal cost structure as executed by Heinz, 3G and others is astounding. The numbers yesterday just blew everybody away in terms of the kind of value creation and the stock kind of proved it.","Gary, how do you respond to kind of the cost cutting efforts that the company has taken so far and why aren\u2019t there just dramatically larger efforts that ConAgra could employ just given the size of the entity and again from where you started when it was decentralized to then it kind of comes together in this one unit, it feels like we\u2019re going the other way with ZBB right now, I hope that was somewhat clear?","Gary Rodkin","Yeah David understood and you know from a lot of the discussions we\u2019ve had in the past and from the results that we have generated pretty significant savings from our supply chain and SG&A functions year-after-year and the continuous improvement in efficiencies of our operations as well alive for us.","So I think we\u2019ve been at that for long time, put a lot of points on the Board and I expect that future will hold the same.","David Driscoll","John, can you make any comments here even from your past experiences?","John Gehring","Well in principle, I don\u2019t comment on other companies in our industry. So I\u2019m sure you understand I know we\u2019ve a lot to add here. I just I think for those of you know me, you know I\u2019m a big believer in a lean enterprise because that ultimately creates a strong bottom line and fuel for growth and I think that\u2019s just a philosophical view, beyond that, I don't have a lot to add.","David Driscoll","Okay, well look forward to your more detailed comments later on. Thanks everyone.","Gary Rodkin","Thank you, David.","Operator","We\u2019ll move now to Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning thanks very much.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","I know -- kind of a detail-ish question but we haven\u2019t talked about synergies for a while with the Private Brands business, but in light you did mention that you changed some assumptions, which kind of triggered this write down this morning.","And I\u2019m wondering I think we\u2019ve last heard about synergies in the $300 million range by 2017, I think that was about 18 months ago and correct me if I\u2019m wrong about that. Do you -- did those assumptions change as part of the write down and can you give us a rough sense where in the segment reporting those synergies would tend to sit at this point. Thank you.","John Gehring","Yeah Jonathan this is John Gehring. I will cover that. First of all I would say we have been delivering the synergies that we set out to deliver, obviously we\u2019re not getting those to the bottom line and obvious what that implies is that just our base business execution has deteriorated.","And that\u2019s what\u2019s really I think reflected in the impairment and how long it\u2019s going to take us to turn that around. So I think we still are on track to drive out the cost and probably as we started out, we said about two-thirds or three quarters of that was going to be in the COGS area and supply chain and that\u2019s still the case and awful lot of that is being realized in procurement areas.","So I\u2019d say we\u2019ve made good progress on the SG&A. We continue to make good progress in supply chain, but we\u2019ve got to get the base business stabilized so that more of those synergies drop to the bottom line.","Jonathan Feeney","Thank you. John. I'll just follow-up though. I\u2019m trying to understand what segment kind of the Private Brand, Consumer, Commercial how would those synergies split? Are they overwhelmingly or even across the three?","John Gehring","I would say, the lion's share of them is still sitting in Private Brands, but -- and I don\u2019t have the number in front of me. The consumer has benefited over the last couple of years from some of the scale, particularly in the procurement areas, but I would say probably two-thirds are still sitting in the Private Brands area.","Q \u2013 Jonathan Feeney","Great thank you. And if I can just get one last question in for Gary before and Gary thanks for everything, I guess as you look back over the past 10 years and just philosophically, with gross margin being a trade-off between pushing for market share and price and water changes in commodities over that time.","From the time that you joined 10 years, my guess is you had a vision of growing gross margin may be a little bit more so than has happened. Can you comment about why shouldn\u2019t and forget about the Private Brand side of the business, just the branded side of the business carry higher gross margins at ConAgra and what were some of the surprises maybe on road to that, that maybe give us some learnings about the job that John faces.","Gary Rodkin","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good question Jonathan and we're always looking to improve our margin structure. We had a spell I can think off three or four years of very dramatic inflation that was tough for all of us to manage through, but I think the balance between driving for productivity on the supply chain side as well as SG&A has served us well.","And I think to Sean's earlier comment, operating in a lean fashion is what's really required in an industry that frankly is not a high growth industry. It\u2019s one which is a very large landscape and we have to battle for share.","So I am pleased that we've been able to certainly recently start to make some forward progress on the share front, but it's always going to be a balance, but continuing down the productivity front is really important because that's what gives the fuel to grow.","Operator","We'll move now to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Gary best wishes from me as well and Sean welcome back. I have a question and a follow-up if I can. ConAgra is trying to turn around Private Brands for many quarters now I think by the company\u2019s own words haven\u2019t necessarily been successful yet. So how do we get confidence that this latest effort will finally I guess be the one that solves the riddle, right?","I am sure we can see you are talking about some legitimate changes being made, but I am an outsider and I hear that one of the key differences will be faster graphic changes on packages, I\u2019ll be honest that doesn\u2019t really excite me that much. So any color there would be helpful.","Gary Rodkin","Yes. Let me start by saying clearly we're not where we want to be with the Private Brand business. It's obviously been a disappointing for all of us here at ConAgra. This has been more difficult and taken longer than we anticipated and plan.","However, I think we all firmly believe we can improve our performance by focusing on what we can control, which is our execution and we are firmly committed to making those necessary changes. So a little more colorful Paul.","Paul Maass","Yes Kenneth bottom line, we do need to improve our own execution. You're kind of asking what do we really mean by that and simply put, I would say we are changing the way we're running the business, focusing on the four areas that I described in the formal comments.","Narrow product focus with deep expertise in each business, improving commercialization speed, consistently meeting our customers service expectation and most importantly expanding our margins. These are basic things that are required to win in Private Brands.","And I think it's really important we stay really close to our customers. They've giving us plenty of actionable feedback regarding kind of what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong.","We've been really granular in our assessment and we have a clear understanding of the root causes of the challenges and we're committed at executing all these changes in the whole overall turnaround effort.","So I appreciate what you're saying, but I just reiterate that we're committed to it and we have confidence we will grow profits in '16.","Ken Goldman","I\u2019ll just let it go there. I realize we're running a little long. I appreciate it guys.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks Ken.","John Gehring","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning everybody.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Katzman","Gary, it's been a pleasure. Sean welcome back. So I guess just a quick detailed question, with the impairment, should goodwill expense be significantly lower? I guess it's been running since the transaction is like call it $100 million to $110 million is that going to switch to being much lower now?","Sean Connolly","No Eric actually the impairment of goodwill, goodwill is not an asset that we amortize. So really the impairment is going to have a very little impact if any on our amortization expense going forward.","Eric Katzman","Okay. I'll follow-up and then I guess maybe Gary and Sean you could both address this kind of more of an industry question.","Some of the other companies have recently talked about seeing somewhat better category trends sequentially and I\u2019m just kind of as you kind of look at the last couple of months, are you seeing it and what do you attribute it to better macro or the industry starting to get the product lines better aligned with the changing consumer and I understand it\u2019s modest but we\u2019re certainly all hoping it happens.","Sean Connolly","Eric, I would just start by telling you we see it clearly on the away from home side and you know that we\u2019ve got a very large scale advantaged food service business anchored by Lamb Weston and we are clearly seeing that happen here in North America, on the consumer front Tom you\u2019re seeing what?","Tom McGough","Yes generally speaking as we look forward we see it to be an industry with nominal growth that's primarily defined as a market share battle and our focus is on the things that we can control fixing the fundamentals within our portfolio, investing in our businesses.","While there are some macro things that we believe should provide some tailwinds lapping the snap reductions, certainly lower gasoline prices ultimately provide additional income. We\u2019re not really counting on those to be a part, we're really focused on the things that we can control and we\u2019ve made very good progress in building our share in very big and important categories.","Operator","Thank you. We will move now to Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning, Alexia.","Sean Connolly","Good morning, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","So Gary it\u2019s been great working with you and Sean definitely welcome back again. So just one question there was some discussion earlier about the improvement from the innovation that you\u2019re seeing in Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher, Healthy Choice, and I remember about a year ago, Gary was seeing we've been trying to recruit new consumers into those brands and it's just proving a bit challenging.","How are you measuring the return on investment in those innovation and product developments in that, how can you be sure that the money that you're turning into the brands now is really going to drive value creation as the time. Thank you and I will pass it.","Tom McGough","Alexia this is Tom McGough and I feel -- let me frame up the answer to your question around this. Fundamentally we believe in brand building and we build brands and we believe that that's best done when brands are what we call ANP ready.","Clear consumer insights and effective strategy to win in the marketplace and solid fundamentals in the business and we're investing in those brands that are ANP ready. Brands like Marie Callender, Reddi-wip, Hunt, Slim Jim are just a few and we see the impact from those.","As I\u2019ve talked about formally, we've captured the number one share in our largest single category which is frozen single served meals and even on a brand like Reddi-wip, we now claim the category lead not only in refrigerated, but also in frozen.","So we see a real impact, real return when we invest behind the brands that are ENP ready. Those businesses that you highlighted were businesses that we had to do some work to get them to be ready to make further investments.","We focused on the fundamentals. We\u2019ve stabilized and we've been growing some of those businesses and throughout this year we focused on the insights, the strategy, the fundamentals. As we move into our fourth quarter and into FY '16 we have more brands that are ANP ready. Our ANP in Q4 will be up and we expect to invest more in FY '16.","So this has been a foundational year getting those right. We see impact when we have those factors all lined up and that's our general approach of how we make investments in our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. We'll move now to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning and good luck Gary and welcome back Sean. So my question is for Sean and so one way to look at your fit with ConAgra or something that investors have talked about is you obviously have a very, very strong branded background.","But on the Private Label side perhaps not as much. Can you just talk about from your perspective why this role is a good fit for you personally and perhaps maybe comment on the fact that you haven\u2019t had as much experience in Private Brands and why that shouldn\u2019t really matter in this case?","Sean Connolly","Well Akshay I think you know I've been doing this for about 23, 24 years now and over that time I have managed all sorts of businesses from branded businesses to commercial businesses and private branding businesses.","So I\u2019m very comfortable here at ConAgra Foods with the businesses we\u2019ve got. It's very familiar to me and that's why I am enjoying myself now going deep on each and every aspect of our operations. So I can get back to you all in the coming months with an assessment of what I see.","What I can tell you with conviction is I am here at ConAgra Foods because I see a tremendous opportunity to create a lot of value over time. We have tremendously strong assets and we have got a highly motivated team. So overall, I am very excited to be here and I think we can put some points on the Board.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Credit Suisse\u2019s Rob Moskow.","Robert Moskow","Hi thank you and best wishes Gary and good luck Sean. So my question actually is for John Gehring, when I saw the release today and the comments that all three business units delivered results just a little bit better than you thought, when you did your preannouncement. I guess it\u2019s good, but it was only two weeks left in the quarter, when you had your profit warning.","And it's just strange to see all three units doing better than you thought with so little time left in the quarter and for Sean to execute the visibility into the operations is going to have to be good, the systems are going to have to be good. So maybe you can just give us a little more color on what changed in those two weeks that surprised you on the upside, thanks.","John Gehring","Yes I appreciate the question Robert, Obviously day in, day out we're trying to forecast our business as best we can. And I don\u2019t want to quibble with the timeframes. I would just note that we had not yet closed the third period of the quarter which is also the biggest period of the quarter.","So the timing of the release versus the date of the information we have is a little bit off, but nonetheless, I think the things I would point to is first of all about $0.02 to $0.03 of the over-delivery was driven by the lower tax rate and that\u2019s just really a function of in the third quarter at the end of the third quarter every year we reconcile our prior year provision to the actually final tax return. That's just something that happens late in the quarter.","So we're unable to predict that until we get through the work. So that is probably $0.02 to $0.03 of it. I think the other piece is we're really in the consumer business again the last period of the quarter was the biggest and it finished stronger.","And then I would say the other element is in the commercial business in Lamb Weston in particular. Their domestic volumes came in strong, but I would say they also had a little bit of upside in terms of what we're assuming around the port issue on how much throughput we would get which has obviously been a challenging thing to predict over time.","So we clearly are working every day to get tighter on our ability to forecast the business, but we did have a few things come to us for the last month of the quarter that created a little bit of volatility.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question and best to both you Gary and Sean. Hey John, just a question for you, free cash flow or cash from operations guidance is down a little bit, but I guess if I did the math right, you got to generate about $800 million or so of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, which is a lot higher than the fourth quarter last year and I think looking back even most fourth quarters over the last 20 years.","So can you just talk a little bit about some of the moving parts in 4Q that get us to that cash from operations? Are there any, I don't know, I guess sort of discrete or one-time items that help it and just try to get a shape for whether or not we can forecast a similar number for next year or whether, whether or not there are some one-time things that are helping this year, thanks?","John Gehring","Yes, I will, we'll obviously get to next year at a different time. Clearly we -- our fourth quarter is always a very strong quarter of cash generation. I would, without having a lot of details in front of me, clearly our inventory levels are much higher going into fourth quarter and while we expect them to still be higher at the end of the fourth quarter, the amount of the inventory will liquidate over the fourth quarter is going to be higher this year.","I also think if you look at probably our accounts payable and some of the accruals, I would expect that we will have more progress and contribution from those in the fourth quarter as well as I also believe our tax payments year-over-year are going to look different also.","So there are a number of moving pieces there within the pieces outside of earnings, but again I would remind everybody that we've typically had very strong cash generation in the fourth quarter.","Operator","And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I\u2019ll hand the conference back to you for final or closing remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Well just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release and as always we're available for discussions. Thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s ConAgra Foods third quarter earnings conference call.

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Kearney, please go ahead.","Brian Kearney","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and happy holidays. I\u2019ll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call. While we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve.

The reconciliation of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in either of the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site, ConAgrabrands.com.","Finally, we will be making references to total ConAgra Brands, as well as legacy ConAgra Brands. References to legacy ConAgra Brands refer to measures that exclude any income or expenses associated with the recently acquired Pinnacle Foods Business.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone and happy holidays. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call. On today\u2019s call, we will unpack our driving consumption and growth, particularly in our frozen and snacks businesses and we will provide our initial perspective on and plans for the Pinnacle Business. There is lot to cover, so let\u2019s jump right in.","In terms of the legacy ConAgra Brands Business, we built on our recent momentum during the second quarter as we continued to gain share in key refrigerated and frozen, and grocery and snacks businesses. Given our performance to-date and our expectations for the year, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2019 sales and margin guidance for legacy ConAgra Brands. In addition to driving results in our legacy ConAgra Brands Business, we completed the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. In the short time since we\u2019ve owned the business, our team is been working hard on the integration, which is progressing seamlessly.","Later in the call, we\u2019ll share more on what we\u2019ve learned about Pinnacle over the past several weeks, including our initial plans to address some of the challenges facing that portfolio. Importantly, we believe that we have the right playbook to address these issues and that work is already underway. While today\u2019s comments regarding Pinnacle will be preliminary, we will have much more say about Pinnacle at our Investor Day on April 10, 2019 in Chicago where we plan to provide a comprehensive update on our progress, opportunities and outlook. We hope you can attend.","Turning to the results for the quarter. From a high level, we continued to deliver consumption growth for legacy ConAgra Brands driven by Frozen and Snacks where we have focused our efforts on brand building and innovation. The optics of the quarter were affected by the impact of last year's hurricanes. Also, some shipment slid from late Q2 into early Q3, which is not unusual around the holidays. Overall, the sales are largely in line with our expectations. And importantly, we exceeded our margin expectations.","You can see on Slide 7, our domestic retail segments continued to demonstrate the impact of the successful execution of our strategy in the form of consistent accelerating consumption trends. Consumer takeaway is the key driver of growth. Our deliberate actions to invest in brand building and deliver strong innovation slate, particularly in our Frozen and Snacks and Sweet Treats businesses is driving strong year-over-year consumption growth, as well as consistent improvement on a two year basis. It's worth noting that we posted positive year-over-year retail sales growth in every month of calendar 2018 except for September the month that we last year's hurricanes.","As you can see on Slide 8, we continued to drive growth based on strong fundamentals tied to the strength of our brands, base velocities, sales and TPDs remain in fertile territory and continue to gain momentum on a two year basis. To provide the proper context for this quarter's sales performance, we would like to take a quick step back and remind you of what took place in fiscal 2018. As you may recall from Q2 of fiscal '18, we saw an uptick in demand due to the hurricanes, which increased last year's Q2 net sales by approximately 220 basis points. So don't look at this year's Q2 growth rate in isolation.","As you can see on Slide 9, if we look at the growth on a two year basis, organic net sales have grown 70 basis points.","We will now turn to our segment results starting with Refrigerated and Frozen. Our results here tell a tale of two things based on where we have applied our playbook and where we have not. The segment overall is up 50 basis points with Frozen, driving all of the growth. The decline in refrigerated reflects the fact that with the exception of Reddi-wip, we have yet to bring innovation to the marketplace.","As one of the final pieces of the legacy ConAgra portfolio to receive attention, our Refrigerated products still appear on the shelf today largely the same way they did in the 90s, and it shows in the results. However, there's a slate of exciting innovations coming to Refrigerated in 2019, we will debut these exciting international Egg Beaters and spread innovations at our Investor Day in April. So stay tuned.","We've talked a lot in prior quarters about the successful implementation of our playbook in Frozen. As you can see on Slide 11, that success continues. We are reinvigorating and leading this $5.2 billion category. And our Frozen single-serve meals continue to be the fastest growing in terms of total retail sales. The chart on this page demonstrates that our growth in the absolute is not only strong but accelerating. This growth has been the result of our rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brands through renovation and innovation and that is our view, we're increasing our whole penetration, average selling prices are moving up and promotions are moving down. We're growing both sales and distribution, and customers are benefiting via category growth and improved margins.","As you can see on the left, we\u2019ve also benefited from increasing household penetration, which continues to build. In the most recent quarter alone, we attracted 1.7 million more households to our products, which is on top of the 1.8 million added a year ago. While we see growth coming from all age cohorts, including millennial, Gen X and Boomers, our growth does over-index to younger-generations. Younger consumers are clamouring for contemporary frozen foods, but large manufacturers have been slow to move in that direction. We\u2019ve incorporated the modern food attributes millennials value into our iconic brands to re-imagine our frozen portfolio. As a result, we\u2019re capturing an outsized share of the growth among millennials and Gen X consumers.","Slide 14 emphasizes once again how the strength of our brands is allowing us to capture growth the right way. As the chart on the left shows, given our product quality improvements, we have been able to consistently increase the price per unit in our frozen single serve meals. At the same time, our single serve meals are requiring fewer promotions, and our approach is not only having a positive impact on our results, but it\u2019s also driving category growth in frozen single serve meals overall. In the last 52 weeks, the category is up $138 million with $184 million of that coming from us.","Our retailers value what we\u2019re doing and their hungry for more. Results of our efforts in frozen could not be more clear, our legacy ConAgra Frozen single serve meals are the fastest growing in the industry, both in terms of retail sales and total point of distribution. This demonstrates that our proven approach to brand building and innovation is helping us gain share. Retailers care about category growth and their allocating more shelve space to our products, because we\u2019re driving the growth in the category. Importantly, we continue to see years of runway in frozen and expect the space to benefit from long-term demographic tailwinds. ConAgra is in a tremendous position to capitalize on this opportunity, especially after the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods and its strong portfolio of frozen brands.","Turning to our grocery and snacks segment, as a reminder this segment was heavily impacted by last year\u2019s hurricane, particularly in our shelf stable meals and sides businesses, which benefited from the pantry stocking behavior that typically takes place around the major storm. If you look at just the snacks businesses, we grew organic net sales by 3.8% during the quarter. As a reminder, we have nearly $2 billion snacks and sweet treats business that is large but focused. By applying the ConAgra playbook, we\u2019re delivering strong and accelerating growth in this important business, including 6.4% retail sales growth in the second quarter. We see a tremendous opportunity for that growth to continue.","At the National Association of Convenient Store Show, also known as NACS, we gave you our new approach to snacks and sweet treats to our retailers. Slide 19 shows some of the innovation we introduced, which includes new varieties and on on-trend flavors and reflects our focus on optimizing price by architecture with multiple product configurations. Our products were well received and we expect to continue to build on the strong momentum we delivered in the quarter as these new innovations hit the market in 2019.","So, we feel good about our momentum in the legacy ConAgra business, and now we have the opportunity to build that momentum overtime with the acquisition of Pinnacle. So, let\u2019s talk Pinnacle. Our second quarter includes 31 days of Pinnacle\u2019s results. We remain excited about the opportunities presented by the combine portfolio, the addition of Pinnacle, expand our presence in our most strategic categories, including frozen foods and snacks, and brings together two complementary portfolios of iconic brands.","We successfully closed the transaction faster than originally expected. And frankly, I'm glad we've taken the reins. We've all seen the weak scanner data on key Pinnacle brands over the past several months, and the 31 days of results we\u2019re reporting today aren't where they need to be. We need to bring our executional capabilities to the Pinnacle business now. We've spent eight weeks since close going deep on the Pinnacle business. We now have a clear understanding of the source of the weakness in the business and we've started to take action.","I'm going to spend a few minutes sharing what we've learned. I'm also going to be transparent about where we see the Pinnacle business landing its legacy fiscal year versus its standalone targets and most importantly I'm going to speak to the opportunity that lies ahead. ","Here are the key takeaways. First, near-term issues do exist in the Pinnacle business, but they are fixable and we are the right team to fix them. ConAgra has the capabilities to put Pinnacle's brands back on track and deliver for its customers and consumers and shareholders. Second, our work in these initial weeks post close has revealed the opportunity to exceed our initial synergy target for the transaction. And third, I don't want there to be any doubt we are as excited as ever to have the Pinnacle family of brands in our portfolio.","Let's look back at Pinnacles recent history. Its business strength in the years since its IPO relies heavily on strong innovation and flawless execution on what Pinnacle historically referred to as its leadership brand; Birds eye, Wishbone and Duncan Hines among others. This contributed to steady growth sustained over time. Slide 24 shows that growth stalled on these three key leadership brands in 2018.","Given this, previous share gains were reversed, Birdseye, Duncan Hines and Wishbone have all suffered sales and distribution losses this past year and this weakness accounts for the vast majority of Pinnacles current challenges. So what happened? Simply put, innovation and execution came up short. And when that happens, in my experience, a virtue led cycle can sometimes emerge and that appears to be the case with respect to Pinnacles leadership brand.","While there was plenty of innovation activity over the past two years, the results clearly show the innovation was insufficient to sustain growth, primarily because it was subpar in its execution. With regards to execution, Pinnacle over-extended new items in the same demand pool, favored high margins over high quality and highly competitive products, and missed some major consumer trends. These missteps ultimately undermined brand strength and pricing power, while gross productivity was insufficient to make up for operational offsets like a major product recall.","Instead of improving the products more subpar SKU entered the market, which led to even more inefficient SKU proliferation. And then to try to jumpstart volume, low ROI trade was infused behind price promotion; compounding this unenviable situation with acute cost inflation, particularly in transportation and better innovation from the competition; and as you'd expect the side effect of disappointed customers. When Birdseye, Duncan Hines and Wishbone delve further into the virtue led cycle and brand performance stalled, customers reduced distribution. Since then, each brand has lost shared with competition. Given these dynamics, the Pinnacle business will unfortunately under-deliver its pretty close internal standalone targets.","On sales, we now estimate the Pinnacle portfolio will land calendar year \u201918 at roughly $3 billion, which is about $160 million or 5% below Pinnacle\u2019s target. Approximately $30 million of this miss is driven by our post close decisions to exit some year-end promotions that we saw as extremely low ROI. At adjusted gross margin, we now estimate Pinnacle would have closed out calendar year \u201918 at approximately 28%, which is roughly 230 basis points below it's internal targets. Dave will go deeper on all of this shortly. As you think about the balance of this fiscal year, keep in mind that historically, Pinnacle\u2019s gross margin performance was lower in the front half of the calendar year than the back half.","So clearly, these results are highly disappointing and they mean we\u2019re going to be putting our near-term focus on fixing the fundamentals before the business returns to growth. And we will restore growth. Despite recent declines in sales and distribution, base velocities have been improving as non-investment grade SKUs are being pruned. Most of the Pinnacle products that remain on shelves today are high quality, which gives us a good base to build from.","Let me be clear, Pinnacle\u2019s current challenges can and will be fixed. Working collaboratively with the Pinnacle team, we are taking action to reverse these trends, returning off inefficient trade deals, shutting down weak innovation projects and identifying areas where focus is desperately needed. We have also devised an action plan. First things first, we will continue to flawlessly integrate the business. Our people, processes and technology integrations are on track today, and we will not lose focus on that important work.","Second, we will implement our value over volume approach on the Pinnacle portfolio, with an eye on cutting weak and low margin SKUs, and redesigning trade programs for better ROI. And third, we will leverage our proven insights and innovation capabilities to rebuild Pinnacle's volume base through innovation and renovation that modernizes and premiumizes Pinnacle brands. We will return these iconic brands to the desired level of performance, and we will do it convincingly. But it won\u2019t happen overnight. Pinnacle's fiscal year was aligned to the calendar year. And as a result, it has communicated much of its 2019 innovation and trade plans to customers pre-close. Fortunately, this work was built on the same week and footing embedded in Pinnacle\u2019s 2018 initiatives.","As I mentioned, we are absolutely stopping the initiatives that we can responsibly stop. But most of our new word won\u2019t be ready to show customers until well into calendar 2019. As a result, I don\u2019t expect the material improvement in Pinnacle\u2019s underlying trends until the second half of ConAgra's fiscal 2020.","Now that you have a sense of the actions we\u2019re taking on the brand execution side of the house, let me spend a moment on our transaction expectations, first synergies. In short, we see more opportunity here than we initially estimated. Now that we\u2019ve had a chance to go deeper and get more granular in areas where we just couldn\u2019t get full transparency in pre-close, we\u2019re quite pleased. Dave will talk more about this during his comments. But not only are we on track to deliver $250 million of cost synergies by fiscal 2022, we see real upside.","In fact, current chemical weakness means we are starting from a lower pace in fiscal year 2019, more on that from Dave in a minute, we expect to over deliver on cost synergies and hit fiscal 2020 EPS that drove our original EPS accretion guidance for this transaction. Finally, we remain committed to the leverage targets that we previously announced, as well as a solid investment grade credit rating.","So to sum up pinnacle for now, the deterioration in the legacy Pinnacle business over the course of calendar year 2018 means we have some hard work to do. However, my confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth for investors with this acquisition is unwavering. One, the strategic logic for this transaction remains compelling. The acquisition provides us with iconic brands in attractive categories, including frozen and snacks. It offers us greater scale with customers and increases our health and wellness credentials. Two, challenges that the pinnacle businesses face has been largely self-inflicted due to subpar innovation and executional missteps. And we have the right capabilities to address these challenges.","And three, let me reiterate our transaction expectations remain intact. In short, the implication of our assessment is one of near-term timing and not of absolute success. Looking ahead, we will not take our foot off the gas in the legacy ConAgra business, we will continue to roll out innovation and to drive the top line and build upon our accelerated momentum in frozen snacks, searching to seize opportunities in Refrigerated and condiments and enhancers and ensure our reliable contributor businesses are competitive.","We also remain squarely focused on executing across our margin drivers to fuel growth. And as we just discussed, we have already mobilized to aggressively apply our playbook to the Pinnacle portfolio. We look forward to sharing a comprehensive update on our progress and outlook during our Investor Day on April 10th in Chicago.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David Marberger","Thank you, Sean and good morning everyone. Slide 33 outlines our performance for the quarter. As Sean I mentioned, Q2 came in largely in line with our expectations for legacy ConAgra. I'll walk through the quarter and elements of both the legacy ConAgra and Pinnacle businesses, and share our perspectives on the balance of the year.","So let's jump in. Net sales for the second quarter were up 9.7% compared to a year ago, reflecting the inclusion of pinnacle for 31 days. Organic net sales, excluding the effects of the sale of Trenton, were down 1.6%. Organic net sales were impacted by both the hurricanes in Q2 a year ago and some quarter-end shipments that moved into early Q3. For the quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 7.6% to $704 million and adjusted gross margins declined 58 basis points to 29.5%. The addition of Pinnacle's results drove the adjusted gross profit dollar improvement, and I'll walk you through the adjusted gross margin bridge in a moment.","In the quarter, total company A&P expense decreased to $69 million or 2.9% of net sales. Although, down from the prior year, our investment was up from 2.3% of net sales in the first quarter due to seasonality. The year-on-year comparison reflects our continued shift from A&P investment to higher ROI retail retailer marketing. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was down 4.4% compared to the prior year and was 9.1% of net sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower incentive base compensation in the legacy ConAgra business. This included lower stock based compensation expense due to the lower share price, which was partially offset by the addition of expenses related to the Pinnacle Business.","Adjusted operating profit increased 22.3% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 181 basis points versus year ago. Higher than expected gross margin in legacy ConAgra, together with favorable SG&A and AMP spending, contributed to these results. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 for the quarter up 21.8% in the prior year, driven by strong operating profit in the legacy ConAgra business.","Slide 34, outlines the drivers of our net sales change versus the same period a year ago. During the quarter, organic net sales growth ex-Trenton, declined 1.6%. Sales related to the two Hurricanes in the second quarter a year ago negatively impacted net sales by an estimated 220 basis points. This impact was partially offset by an increase in price mix before retailer marketing investments of 1.1%. Total ConAgra net sales grew 9.7%, driven by the acquisitions of Pinnacle, Angie's and Sandwich Bros. The sales of the Trenton facility in Canadian Del Monte business partially offset the acquisition benefits. FX negatively impacted net sales by 40 basis points versus the prior year due to the weakening of the Mexican Peso and Canadian dollar.","Slide 35, outlines the adjusted gross margin change for the quarter. We continued our strategic increase in retailer and marketing investments in the second quarter, which reduced adjusted gross margin by 40 basis points. Input cost inflation of 2.9% in the second quarter negatively impacted adjusted gross margin another 200 basis points. Transportation and warehousing costs were up 10% in the quarter. We also saw inflation on packaging and certain ingredients with deflation in proteins, fats and oils. We offset most of the inflation in the legacy ConAgra business with favorable price mix and realized productivity improvements, which improved adjusted gross margin 180 basis points for the second quarter. Mix was negatively impacted in the quarter from higher margin Hurricane related food service volumes sold in the prior year second quarter. Pinnacle adjusted gross margin was in line with legacy ConAgra for Q2.","Turning to Slide 36. This outlines our net sales performance by reporting segments. The grocery, snacks and food service segments were both negatively impacted in the quarter by the prior year sales resulting from the two Hurricanes. The grocery and snacks organic net sales decline was partially offset by organic net sales growth of 3.8% for the snacks and sweet treats business, driven by retail consumption of 6.4% in the quarter. The food service business was further impacted by the sale of the Trenton facility. Excluding the Hurricane and threaten impacts, food service net sales would have been approximately flat versus the year ago.","On refrigerated and frozen, as Shaun discussed, organic net sales were up 0.5%, driven by continued strong performance in frozen of plus 1.8%, partially offset by a decline at refrigerated of 4.8%. Our legacy ConAgra single-serve frozen meal performance continued to be very strong with retail consumption up 11.3% in the quarter. International segment organic net sales were up 3.9% in the quarter, driven by both volume and price mix strength. Pinnacle delivered $259 million in net sales in the second quarter.","Moving to Slide 37. You can see that legacy ConAgra adjusted operating profit increased 5.4% and legacy ConAgra adjusted operating margin came in at 16.9% for the second quarter, significantly above both year ago performance and second quarter guidance. Pinnacle adjusted operating margin was 22% as lower than expected gross margin was offset by better than estimated SG&A and A&P reductions. Total ConAgra adjusted operating profit was up 22.3% versus a year ago and adjusted operating margin was 17.5% for the second quarter.","Slide 38 outlines the drivers of our 21.8% adjusted EPS improvement for the quarter versus a year ago. We prepared the bridge to first show legacy ConAgra EPS drivers, followed by the Pinnacle adjusted operating profit and then incremental capital costs associated with the acquisition. Starting on the left, legacy ConAgra EPS grow from $0.55 to $0.68 was driven by increased adjusted operating profit along with a lower effective tax rate and lower weighted average shares prior to our equity issuances related to the Pinnacle acquisition.","The impact of increased Pinnacle adjusted operating profit offset by higher incremental adjusted interest expense and share dilution from the debt and equity issues to finance the Pinnacle acquisition reduced EPS to $0.67. Even with the dilutive impact of Pinnacle, EPS of $0.67 for the second quarter exceeded the legacy ConAgra guidance of $0.57 to $0.60.","Slide 39 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Cash flow from operating activities from continuing operations was $251 million for the six months ended Q2, which was down from a year ago due to higher costs incurred for acquisitions and divestitures and higher working capital driven by the shift and the timing of AR cash collections.","CapEx for the six months ended Q2 was $133 million, up slightly versus year ago due to the timing of projects. Net debt at the end of the second quarter was $11.1 billion, representing a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 5 times on the latest 12 months pro forma EBITDA in line with our expectations. At the end of the second quarter, our average debt maturity was approximately nine to 10 years, and our weighted average coupon was approximately 4.7%. At the end of the second quarter, fixed rate debt was approximately 83% of our total debt. There are no prepayment penalties on our variable rate term loans, which totaled $1.3 billion at the end of Q2 giving us flexibility to de-lever.","As Sean mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we've made in identifying synergies and we expect to deliver more than the $250 million in total cost synergies we previously disclosed. As a reminder, our synergy estimates are net of additional reinvestments, and we expect this net synergy estimate to benefit the P&L between fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2022. We expect to over deliver on our synergy targets without incurring any cash costs to achieve above the estimated $355 million. We estimate that we will deliver approximately $20 million in synergy savings or about 10% of the originally disclosed amount for full year fiscal 2019. As for the sources of upside, we see incremental savings primarily in the areas of SG&A and procurement. We are still working the details but intend to deliver these higher savings as quickly as possible.","As Sean mentioned, we anticipate leveraging the synergy upside to deliver strong EPS growth of the estimated fiscal year 2019 EPS phase to get us through the fiscal year '22 EPS target that drove our original EPS accretion guidance for this transaction. We will provide more information supporting a new long term algorithm at our Investor Day on April 10th. And finally, we remain committed to our debt leverage targets, which I will discuss shortly.","Slide 41 summarizes our updated fiscal year 2019 outlook for both the legacy ConAgra business and the total company inclusive of the impact of Pinnacle from the closing date of October 26, 2018 through the end of the ConAgra fiscal year, May 26, 2019. In the first column, you'll see that we are reaffirming our legacy ConAgra fiscal year 2019 full year guidance. For this business, which still includes estimates for Wesson for the full year 2019, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%, excluding the impact of the Trenton facility sale. We also expect that legacy ConAgra reported net sales to be about 50 basis points lower than organic due to net divestitures and estimated negative FX.","We continue to expect adjusted gross margin for legacy ConAgra to be in the range of 29.7% to 30%. As we've been discussing, this metric is affected by our continued shift of A&P investments to higher ROI retailer marketing investments. It is also affected by an expected input cost inflation rate of 3% to 3.2% of cost of goods sold. We continue to expect legacy ConAgra adjusted operating margin in the range of 15% to 15.3%.","For Pinnacle, we estimate net sales will be down mid-single digits for our fiscal year 2019 versus the same period a year ago. This equates to $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion in Pinnacle net sales for the seven month period that Pinnacle will be included in ConAgra Brands from fiscal 2019. This estimate reflects the negative consumption trends in the Pinnacle business along with an estimated $30 million of negative net sales impact from our post-close decision to exit some low ROI price promotions that Sean discussed earlier.","We are estimating Pinnacle adjusted gross margins of 27% to 27.3% for the seven months period of performance in fiscal 2019. Pinnacle's input cost inflation is currently trending over 5% with expectations for that to continue through the end of our fiscal year 2019. The Pinnacle gross margin estimate includes the benefit of approximately 100 basis points due to certain accounting reclassifications between cost of goods sold in SG&A that we recorded as we conform Pinnacle's accounting practices with ConAgra's. We are estimating all-in Pinnacle adjusted operating margins of 14.6% to 14.9%. The Pinnacle reporting segment is being impacted by both the intangible asset amortization expense estimated at $17 million for the period and an estimate of $20 million in cost reduction synergies. Also included in those estimates are Pinnacle related expenses that will ultimately be recorded in total ConAgra corporate expense and not the segment for fiscal year 2019.","We are also providing additional updated total company guidance today. We are estimate an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% to 25% for fiscal year 2019. We estimate adjusted net interest expense in the range of $390 million to $395 million, and we estimate average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 446 million for full year fiscal 2019. Finally, we are estimating adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.03 to $2.08, reflecting the outlook information outlined.","As we have consistently communicated, we remain strongly committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and our target leverage ratio is 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA, which we expect to reach by the end of fiscal year 2021. As previously announced, we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend in the current annual rate of $0.85 per share during fiscal year 2019. We suspended our share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. And we will consider repurchasing shares if we are tracking ahead of our leverage targets. Also, we have approximately $720 million remaining on our capital loss carry-forward, which does not expire until the end of fiscal year 2021.","On Tuesday, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to sell the Wesson Oil Brand to Richardson International. We expect the transaction to be closed by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2019 subject to customary closing conditions.","That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator. Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","I guess, first off, just I know Sean that Pinnacle had its own gross margin targets before the deal was announced. And it seems to us that maybe some of this could be incremental to the Pinnacle deal synergy target that you had put out there. So a more optimistic scenario could have led maybe closer to 10% of sales as synergies rather than the stated 7%. And I admit that that was before the deal closed. But it certainly sounded to us that you thought maybe initially that some of that Pinnacle margin opportunity could be delivered upon under ConAgra\u2019s ownership. So it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s the case at this point. Is it a matter of just digging in the Pinnacle once the deal closed and finding out some of the things that you mentioned? Or I guess just another way of asking. Is the pinnacle asset just in a completely different place than maybe you thought it was when you agreed to the deal, because I\u2019m still -- I guess I\u2019m seeing some of the -- hearing some of the language that you\u2019re using in describing the asset and the position its currently in. And we\u2019ve all seen the scanner data. But it just -- that seems far more severe right than I think at least I would have expected?","Unidentified Company Representative ","Let me try to tackle that, Andrew, there\u2019s a lot in there. Clearly, we\u2019ve coveted this portfolio for a while, because of the long-term value creation potential it offers. Unfortunately, as you know, there is only so much you can see in the public company diligence, particularly when you buy a competitor. But as you\u2019ve heard in our prepared remarks, we can see it all now. And from the beginning, we took a conservative approach, both to the price we offer and our synergy commitments and now we are glad we did. Because while we are starting from a lower base, we anticipate delivering strong EPS growth off of that new base and actually hitting the 2022 EPS target that drove our original EPS accretion guidance for this transaction.","Clearly, the gross margin status within the Pinnacle portfolio right now is not where we expected it to be or wanted it to be, but make no mistake about it. The gross margin potential for business is still there. Gross margin in many ways is a symptom of the health of the brands. And as we laid out earlier today in our prepared remarks, there are really three brands that are driving the vast majority of the weakness here, Birds Eye, Duncan Hines and Wish-Bone. And those are the businesses that we got to get on stack. It's not going to be overnight. We\u2019ve got some work to do. But there is not a doubt in our mind that there is significant opportunity to get those brands back where they need to be. It\u2019s just going to take some work. We\u2019ve got to apply basically the ConAgra playbook we applied to our own portfolio back in 2015. We\u2019ve got to do it to Pinnacle, particularly on those three businesses.","Andrew Lazar","And could you just briefly remind us the initial accretion target that you speak of going out to 2022, because very back of the envelope math. Maybe you have suggested that possible double-digit EPS CAGR off of that fiscal '19 base would be possible to get you to where you expected to be by 2022 initially. Is that a fair way of looking at it in terms of how we should we interpret the go forward guidance off of this lower 2019 base at this point?","Sean Connolly","We\u2019ll give you the entire algorithm and the full story around Pinnacle and our total company at Investor Day. But let me break it down, because I think it\u2019s the importance to the folks on the call just in terms of how we think about this 2022 EPS. Before we bought Pinnacle, we had a base plan that excluded major acquisitions and included share buybacks. And that previous base plan was the EPS benchmark we\u2019ve looked deep in the context of the deal. So when evaluating Pinnacle the assumptions we had at the time, we concluded the acquisition would deliver high single-digit EPS accretion relative to that previous base plan. Obviously, that accretion translated to an absolute EPS number in our model. What we\u2019re telling you today is that the starting point is lower due to Pinnacle\u2019s year end business weakness. But given the synergy over delivery we now expect and the business recovery, we expect to get right back to the same place at EPS by 2022. Clearly, the year-on-year EPS growth will now be higher since 2019 is lower, so the CAGR will be higher.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead. ","David Driscoll","John, I wanted just to go back over Pinnacle, I mean, I\u2019ve heard that we can -- you said it. But I wanted to just try to ask question about your 2022 target that we look at differently. North of 5% inflation is a very strong number, you don\u2019t see that number very often in package view companies, typically results in gross margin compression but the target enough price to offset that level of inflation. You've also shown very clearly all these distribution losses. I'm going to boil it down. I think, what I think you're trying to tell us that I need you to course correct me. Is this confidence that you can get to the 2022 numbers really based upon a very significant over delivery on synergies or are there some really big things that need to happen on the Pinnacle business, i. e. sales half that really start to improve, pricing needs to accelerate dramatically? I guess I just want to get this out in the open, because I think people will really worry about if you have to do something heroic to Pinnacle in order to get to that 2022 goal. Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Let me start there and Dave you can fill in more detail on inflation and things like that, because you want to come back to a threshold point here. The vast majority of Pinnacle's challenges reside within three businesses, and I talked a little earlier around what's driven the challenges there. There is no question in my mind that we will make progress on these three businesses, one of them for example is Birds Eye. Birds Eye is an extraordinary brand. It is number one in the veggie and veggie-based meal space. And good things are still happening within the franchise like the Veggie Meal. But the brand architecture has become too fragmented in this finalized space within vegetables with flat out passed over for being too low margin. And when the consumer is hyper passionate about our space as they are about spiralized, you just can't opt out. You've got to give the consumer what they want and figure the margin challenge out as you go. If you opt out, the competitor will fill the vacuum and that's exactly what happened.","The good news is as the number one brand you've always got the opportunity to get back in. And if you look at the Bird's Eye performance in the market over the last few years five years or so it's been nothing short of extraordinary. If you look at Duncan Hine, this is another good news bad news story. Good news is that Duncan Hines has gotten a fair amount of attention over the past two years, and it's been highly responsive. And that makes sense to me, because Duncan Hines is an iconic brand. However, the mental model at Pinnacle was to think of Duncan Hines as a cake mix brand. And accordingly, last year's innovation was named after a portion size it was called perfect size for one, and that cake frame of reference was highly limited. And then when the SKU proliferation occurred to sell optimal execution was really exposed.","So the way that we think about this here at ConAgra is we think of Duncan Hines as a sweet treat brand not as a cake mix. We view perfect size for one not as a portion control cake, but as a convenient warm sweet treat. And as the frame of reference being different, the product design would've been different. And frankly, it would've been more appealing. And unfortunately, the competition figured this out and has been stealing share, so we've got work to do. And then the third one that we pointed to was Wish-Bone. Now this is a big category. It's also a great brand. But frankly it has not benefited from enough disruptive innovation. What has been launched hasn't resonated, for example the - yellow line and that will change. And not only will we innovate within Wish-Bone, we will look at leveraging other iconic ConAgra brands as leverage to disrupt the salad dressing category. ","So we've got a very strong handle on all three of these big businesses and we've got plans that are already being mobilized against. And with respect to the inflation, you point out 5 is a high number. But don't forget in veggies we had a bad crop year this year and bad crop years do happen. And those are transitory issues, so you're not going to have a bad crop, here you have a bad one, you have some good ones. So that too shall pass. We do have other elements in inflation that continue to be pesky like transportation that everybody is struggling with. But the overall point I\u2019m making here is I do not seek any need for heroic action. What I see need for is clarity of thinking and an excellent execution of the very same ConAgra playbook that we have applied to different brands over and over again. Dave?","David Marberger","Yes. So just to build on that, if you look at the calendar year 2018 chart that Sean showed. The gross margins are 220 basis points below the Pinnacle forecast. Half of that mix was from inflation on freight transportation and also as Sean just mentioned coming out of the fresh pack season with higher vegetable inflation. Another part of that though was given the volumes of clients that Sean discussed in the big 3 Pinnacle attempted to add price promotions in the second half to make up for the volume. These were not efficient programs and result in additional gross margin erosion. So to Sean\u2019s point, the inflation is transitory. We\u2019re on it. And we\u2019re also in the process of eliminating these inefficient trade deals. So we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to work through this. But the forecast that we put out through the end of fiscal \u201919 reflects the continued inflation on vegetables and us working through the inefficient trade.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Tom Palmer","One thing I wanted to understand a little bit better is I understand the virtue less cycle that you've talked about. But I don\u2019t quite understand why Pinnacle\u2019s performance worsened so suddenly. And I imagine it\u2019s largely because of the disappointed customers you talked about with shelf reset, so there\u2019s that. And then I guess adjacent to that, I understand you can\u2019t do all of your due-diligence that you want to do on a competitor. But it still feels I think to some people I\u2019ve talked to this morning and I'll admit to me too like the due-diligence could have been better, right? And I wanted to ask you about that, because why weren\u2019t the conversations being held with customers to see that this was going to come? So this feels like a really big surprise to most of us, something that maybe could have been a little bit avoided but maybe not. I just wanted to get your thought on that.","Sean Connolly","I appreciate that Ken. I will tell you that our passion for this business did not lead us to overlook anything at all as already mentioned, there\u2019s only so much you can\u2019t see in public due diligence. There were, Pinnacle it's not a brand, it\u2019s a diverse company of brands. And so there were obviously businesses that were up and businesses that were down, we were back that in the middle diligence, Wish-Bone as an example with the business, one of the businesses that was beginning to show challenges. But as you can see in your own charts, a lot of what we\u2019re talking about here has really accelerated very dramatically in the second half of this calendar year. So that\u2019s pretty late in the equation.","It\u2019s disappointing I\u2019m not going to tell you that we are not disappointed with the State of the Union. But by the same token, I would tell you we are very confident that we know exactly what to do here, not an overnight trip. This is going to be fundamentals and hard work as we\u2019ve done before. But these are very good brands. I just pointed out we\u2019ve got a concentration here on three businesses. The big one is Birds Eye. Birds Eye was the latest one to emerge, to your question, in terms of it's really showing its weakness. And it was for the reasons that I just described and a more active competitor there.","So these are not structural issues we\u2019re talking about here. These are real business performance issues but there are executional issues, and they\u2019re ones that we will be on top of as we go forward. And we\u2019re going to share with you what exactly those plans look like and what the cadence is about getting these businesses right where they need to be when we do our Investor Day in April.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","So two questions, the first would be for you I guess Sean or Dave. On the revenue, slight miss in the second quarter for the base ConAgra business. It sounds like it was a calendar shift. Can you walk us through that a little bit more, maybe like what caught you off guard? What business gets better sequential? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes, glad to be brought this up. Let me talk net sales, because I know you all see the ramp in net sales in the second half and therefore it'd be on your mind. I wanted you to just be very clear of where we stand on this. Overall, we are very pleased with our top line strength. I think you can see from our presentations, and I\u2019m talking legacy CAG here. I think you could see from our presentations, we have been very successful innovating and modernizing our brands. And because of the Pinnacle acquisition, we have done something out of ordinary for us, which is provide quarterly guidance for past two quarters, which is something we prefer not to do given typical shipment volatility around quarter close. We saw a bit of that this quarter as some of our shipments fell after ThanksGiving and into December.","So you\u2019re really talking about a small shift here really between ThanksGiving and Christmas. And as I mentioned earlier that is not a typical, and it can add some unpredictability to how our revenue was recognized in the quarter. But most importantly, our consumption patterns have continued to build, which is the real story we want to stress, and that will translate to a very strong second half. And the way to think about that ramp is that our first half innovation is now hitting its stride fully out there in the marketing programs they're on and our second half slate, which includes the snacking initiatives I just showed, is very strong and it's also very good mix. And on top of that, the pricing that we have taken is now in the marketplace and being realized, particularly in the second half; so all of that conspires to result in continued momentum on our top line, which we feel very good about for the balance of the year, and the reiteration of our standalone legacy ConAgra guidance.","Steve Strycula","And then I\u2019m sure you addressed this at Investor Day. But can you walk us through preliminary, like how frequent are the shelves reset in some of these core problematic Pinnacle categories, my understand is maybe twice a year. Clearly, the March window seems like that\u2019s probably going to be a miss in terms of refreshing innovation pipeline. But can you speak to from a calendar perspective whether new product can be in place by September, or is this really a much deeper turn in the base business. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Well, a couple of points here. One is as you might imagine when we really got a handle on that what\u2019s going to happen in some of these TPDs, because of the weakness of the Pinnacle innovation, we have sprung into action to stop further proliferation of similar types of SKUs. But we\u2019ve also sprung in action in terms of rebuilding a new innovation pipeline with the Pinnacle team and the ConAgra team working arm and arm to do that, but that\u2019s going to take some time. It\u2019s not going to be all at the exact same window, so it won\u2019t all be the beginning of the second half of 2020. Whatever we can get into the marketplace faster, we will get in. ","And by the way, on TPDs and shelf set, different categories have different numbers of modes that are reset during the year and they happen at different times. But just a couple of words on TPDs, because I think it is top of mind for everybody. Big picture, the key to strong distribution for any given brand are, A, superior innovation and B, the category leading velocities that follow. So if you think about legacy CAG, we have industry leading velocities and key businesses like frozen single serve meals. But we\u2019re actually under skewed today, which is why we continue to grow TPDs and we see further upside from here. Pinnacle, obviously has had their innovation challenges at the same time and better innovation from competition and that's translated to TPD losses. We will fix that.","Another point I want to make on TPDs that you need to keep in mind as you look at TPD, because I think it can be a helpful metric but it also can be misleading, which is the case right now for example on our largest legacy ConAgra business Marie Callender. Let me tell you what's going on with Marie, because Marie is in a very good place right now. Recall, we did a full restage on Marie Callender this year. We reformulated all the products for higher quality, they are higher margin. We eliminated low value SKUs. We've redesigned and modernized the packaging. We launched comfort bowls and we're also optimizing our trade promotions. So overall what we are seeing is that the brand is healthier with growing base sales, higher margins and less trade promotion.","TPDs though are actually down by design and that's because we work with retailers to get more facings on our top movers. So if you look at Q2 as an example on Marie Callender, we saw a velocity improvement of 7% in Q2 over last year and we will take that trade all day long, because it results in a stronger P&L top and bottom line. But you can't see that dynamic when you look at TPD. So as you talk to us even off the call and you\u2019re trying to understand this, let's look at TPD but let's -- we'll try to give you the full story in terms of what we're doing strategically to drive overall better real estate. Because in other words what I'm telling you is TPDs can be a blunt instrument. They only tell you how many items scan, skews scan at a store. They don't tell you how much real estate a brand actually occupies.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","I want to come back like many people to really make sure I understand what's happening in Pinnacle. We saw the first half of the year delivered right through and you reported that. And I know you mentioned that the profit contribution from Pinnacle's blow your expectations this quarter. But it looks like it's flowed through around 22% EBIT margin, which isn't that bad. It's just a shade of what we were expecting. So I look at those data points and I contemplate what you're saying about profitability on the forward. And it sounds like the vast majority of the drop is what's happening now and what's going to be happening over the next few quarters, not necessarily what's happened already to reported results. Is that fair? And related to that, for me to bridge to your EBIT guidance and there\u2019s a lot of guess work here to recalendarize the base. I have to cut profit by almost 30% year-on-year for the back half of the year, which seems very, very jarring. Can you help walk me to what's going to drive that such a substantial downtick on the forward, especially when I contemplate what you're saying about point out inefficiency point out inefficient promotions and some other things that sound like they may actually help you?","Sean Connolly","First, I\u2019m going to take the big picture, Jason, just to come back to the Pinnacle business. And I think I've talked about this in quite a bit of detail today. But the way this virtuous cycle, as I described it manifests itself, is when your innovation is subpar, it does not show out of the gates. It shows up eventually. And it's clearly -- the side effects of it are showing up in the back half of this calendar year frankly very recently. And it is manifesting itself in increased significant distribution cuts on the three businesses as I talked about. As you can imagine, once you\u2019re cut and you\u2019ve got half way to get back in, but it's not going to be with the exact same items that have just been discontinued. You basically got to rebuild the innovation pipe and get it back in when the products are ready and when the window is open. And hence the amount of time it\u2019s going to take to get this thing back. But if you look at whether or not that is executional or structural, it's clearly executional in nature. These brands are still number one in their categories, Birds Eye's example by a country mile. So we've got work to do but we\u2019ll get it back in. In terms of the near-term flows, Dave?","David Marberger","So, Jason I understand the confusion right, because it's a stop here, because we closed October and there is a lot here. So let me try to break it down for you little bit if you look at our quarter that is basically the month of November for Pinnacle. And you\u2019re right it shows a higher operating margin relative to what we forecast. November is probably the highest single margin month for Pinnacle, because their margins are higher in the second half of their year than the first half. So, we\u2019re basically capturing one month where gross margins are in the 29. But if we look at that month relative to the prior year month, which you don\u2019t see, it's down about 200 basis points. So the first point is and it's reflected on that calendar year 2018 chart. The gross margin versus prior year trending down to 220 basis points is directionally.","The second piece is that and we did say it and in our comments is that we have made some decisions to pull low ROI programs, which had an impact on sales of about $30 million. So that is also in our forecast, because you're pulling volume out and you have short-term impact of doing that. But we have long-term benefits when you\u2019re trade rate improves. When you get into the second half of ConAgra, that\u2019s really the first half of what Pinnacle would be in their calendar year. That\u2019s always been a lower absolute gross margin, right. So a little bit of this is we\u2019re cutting off of our May fiscal year and you\u2019re seeing a forecast of gross margin that only picks up the first half of Pinnacle. Having said that, that forecast reflects coming out of the recent tax season for vegetables inflation on vegetables. So, now that\u2019s layering into the forecast as well plus the additional transportation inflation that will continue.","So I know it\u2019s complicated but there is a lot of dynamics and because we cut off in May, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t allow you to show the full calendar 2019 Pinnacle, because it\u2019s our fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you -- sheds a little light on the gross margin dynamics.","Jason English","And for me to get my model down there I also need to take out -- one way to get there is to take out a good chunk of the product, the base Pinnacle productivity. Is that reasonable? In other words, is it possible that some of productivity initiatives that they would have had that could have helped gross margin have been put on hold or been disrupted through this transition phase and as you look to resolve some of the other issues?","Sean Connolly","No, we\u2019re staying full theme ahead on the productivity efforts that are underway, both for Pinnacle\u2019s business and for ConAgra\u2019s business. What we\u2019ll happen though, Jason, is we will -- now that we\u2019ve got hold of the company, our supply chain team is all over Pinnacle assets to see if there is additional value that we can add. We talked about our synergies today that\u2019s already a work here, things like applying our CPS program, ConAgra Performance System to the Pinnacle manufacturing assets and supply chain overall. So all of that work is underway and Dave will give you a full update on that as part of our Investor Day, Dave Marberger -- Dave Biegger when we're bigger when we're together in April.","Operator","The next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","So quick question on the fiscal '22 guidance just to be clear, so I'd say the guidance held so high single digit accretive relative to the base before that would have included some buy backs. Obviously, you have talked a lot about Pinnacle today what potentially has change now relative to diligence process and pretty close. But then you're saying the guidance is held, synergies are higher and we expect to get the margin profile back to where it was, because of the playbook that's obviously been implemented across a number of different businesses historically and worked well. So that's the case. The excitement is there and the confidence is there. And we understand the problems and we know how to address it, and we have high confidence in how we're going to fix it and get it back to where it was despite there's a lower starting point.","At the end game on the base -- and relative to your original expectations, would probably still be similar plus you have the synergies. So I guess the question is why wouldn't those expectations then be a little bit higher or are you just playing it safe, because obviously we're in \u201819 and we're talking \u201822 so a time in between that maybe you need a little bit more investment, maybe you don\u2019t. But just walk me through why it would be the same and not higher given the synergies are higher and you think you can get back to the original Pinnacle margin profile? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","From an EPS standpoint, Rob, we can get back there in large part because we've now gotten under the hood and we see more synergies and we've modeled a certain cadence very preliminary of business recovery year. As you might imagine, between now on our Investor Day, that's the work that we're going to be scrubbing, that's the work that we're going to be building out for the next few years. So as we think about this for the long haul, there is no question in our own mind that there's significant opportunity here. In fact the scale and the combination of these two companies make as much strategic sense as ever.","But we've got some hard work to do short term and so that's what we got to deal with. It's a good reminder to me of the importance of focus. Our company has been laser like focused on getting our brands right for the last few years. Here's a portfolio that is clearly suffering right now and needs focus, and we're bring that focus. And how high is up over in the fullness of time, we'll talk more about that later. But we know we've got to do here and we are on the case. Dave, do you want to add some?","David Marberger","Just to add on to that. The synergies we say in the upside, these are the cost synergies right. So the 215 were cost synergies. We did not build any revenue synergies into our model. Now obviously the business is down relative to what we had modeled, so we have to do all the things we discussed to bring that business back. But when you talk about upside going out long-term, we believe that there could be a side on revenue synergies. That's not in the updated cost synergy number that we will have.","Rob Dickerson","And then secondly and particularly just on divestments, I know it's been a topic that's come up for a couple of years since you've had the tax asset. There was announcement this week on Wesson. There is no financial disclosure on that. So any additional color we can receive on Wesson will be helpful. And then outside of that, now that you have Pinnacle in and you\u2019ve looked under the hood. Is the expectation still that while we might try to leverage that tax asset on the legacy ConAgra piece and all of the Pinnacle piece, there could be some areas we will potentially look to divest or rationalize SKUs? That\u2019s it, thanks.","Sean Connolly","Let me start off there, Rob, and turn it over to Dave for more color on Wesson. As we said many times, we do view our capital loss carry forward as an asset and we are open to divestitures that help us strengthen the company and enhance value. And as you point out, the Western news this week is illustrative of that. But it's not our strategy use the tax asset just for the sake of using it. The aim is to perpetually reshape the portfolio for stronger growth and better margins, while maintaining our investment grade credit rating and that has not changed.","With respect to Pinnacle assets, the goal here is to perpetual reshape this portfolio to be stronger. So, it's great to have a tax asset but if it's strategic to divest another piece of business that is a chronic drag that doesn\u2019t have the benefit of the tax asset that\u2019s still possibility. I mean, we\u2019re open to anything open the lay that maximizes value for our shareholders, so that will always to be part of our consideration set. And Dave, on Wesson?","David Marberger","So on Wesson, we have an agreement to sell the Wesson business for $180 million in cash. As I mentioned, we expect to close by the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2019. So assuming we close at the end of our third quarter for fiscal 2019, the sale would impact our sales about 50 basis points and EPS $0.01 to $0.02 for this fiscal year. On an annual basis, the sale would impact net sales about 200 basis points or about $0.05 EPS on an annual basis. And just again on the capital loss carry forward, there will be very little leakage on this divestiture in terms of the tax paid. So if we didn\u2019t have that asset, for example, the $180 million would really be given the net proceeds we\u2019ll have would be equivalent to a transaction or about $220 million. So that just shows you the value we have of that capital loss carry forward and eliminating the leakage.","Operator","The next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Just wanted to dig into Birds Eye little bit, because that was clearly a leader among those so called leadership brands. How much of that Birds Eye loss destruction is a result of shelf loss at one major retailer that happen to introduce retailers branded SKUs and if that\u2019s a fairly local big reason why we\u2019re seeing the loss shelf and pain here. Have we seen the biggest impact from that in the consumption data or might the year-over-year in the data look even worse from now?","Sean Connolly","That is a piece of it, Rob. I think another significant piece that I already talk -- big piece of this whole spiralized space has been a very, very big opportunity and a competitor has really taken that business at major customers. With respect to private label in frozen overtime, here\u2019s how I think about that. As we\u2019ve said before, private label make sense in highly commoditized subcategories but it really has never made sense for work historically in finished meals, side dishes, enhancers, appetizers and things like that. Every few years that I've been around the frozen space, you will have a retailer give it a go but it has never taken hold and it probably will happen again from time to time. It's happening a little bit now in vegetables, but the outcome is unlikely to be any different in these more -- these less commoditized subcategories. Ultimately, when customers see that their store brand advocacy is resulting in declining category sale, there is the there will be the exact same reversal we've seen before. So that's the dynamic that I've seen over and over again, and it plays out the same way almost every single time. ","David Palmer","I mean just to be clear. Have they had that - have we seen the maximum impact from that in the data? And do you see the resultant impact or reversal in your velocities such that this is going to prove to be a one year divot, because your velocities are so strong there's almost pretty good odds that you're going to get back some of that shelf a year from then?","Sean Connolly","Well, it's customer by customer, David. So if there's a customer right now that is taking a stronger advocacy position on a private label, you easily could have other customers that are going in the opposite direction. So this is a never ending dynamic that we deal with in all of our categories and vegetables is a newer one also managed. You all know within Birds Eye, it's a vast franchise from more commoditized looking vegetables to side dishes all the way through complete meals. So you've got different dynamics in each of those and they will continue to evolve over time with pluses and negatives across the customer base and within any given customer across the mix of those sub-segments.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Sean, most of the problems that you've brought up for Pinnacle are product and innovation related. You talked about how it is -- Birds Eye had extended too far and missed some segments of the market. And then you also talked about perfect size for one. But a lot of those issues are very visible on shelf I guess, if you were looking for them. I mean I can't see them, or I haven't seen them. Had anyone from your team noticed these issues this year or over the past couple of years, because it's truly product issues I guess it would have been more visible. And do you think it was just like this year's problem or a multi-year problem over at Pinnacle?","Sean Connolly","Well, this is obviously a very recent problem. As I pointed out today, Pinnacle previously had delivered strong and sustained performance through pretty good execution on these leadership brands. And these innovations that we talked about today did garner good trial. So if you look at Duncan Hines perfect size for one as an example, the sales in the trial window were very strong.","So when you look at something like that the early read on it is a positive, but you don't ultimately know what the stickiness of an innovation is going to be until you start to work your way through several repeat cycles. And frankly in the case of Duncan Hines that's exactly the thing that started manifesting itself this year along with a convergence of new competitive products coming into the marketplace that really solve for some of the gaps in the initial innovation. So that really speaks to the Duncan Hines story.","With the Birds Eye story, as I pointed out, the real hot piece of the category has been this spiralized space where that is a space where out of the gate there is a new very novel innovation, the margin profile on that for anybody who got into the game would be lower. And one of the key competitors was okay with that and went in and built the beachhead while Birds Eye did not. That was a mistake and it allows competitor to gain some significant market share and continue to build on that momentum. All of that is reversible but that\u2019s the thing that as you can in the data is really emerged as we've gone through the course of this summer.","Robert Moskow","And then just a quick question for Dave. Just so I\u2019m clear on how this accretion guidance works and what base we're talking about. First of all, is there any accretion guidance for fiscal 2020 specifically, or we don\u2019t know that yet. Because it sounds like the plans really don\u2019t go into place until fiscal 2021?","David Marberger ","So, we\u2019re going -- any commentary for fiscal 2020, we\u2019re going hold off until the April 10th Investor Day. We don\u2019t want to give piece of this thing. We want to give the complete picture with the synergies with our plans. And so we\u2019re going to through all of that and get into our algorithm and cadence at Investor Day.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Spillane","Just two really quick ones for me. One, one of the questions we\u2019ve been getting a lot this morning is just like is a there a question about whether there is a significant need to step up investment behind Pinnacle, so was it underfunded. So, I guess my first question is just simply as you kind of think about that plan between now and 2022, net of synergies. Does it also contemplate a step up in investment behind Pinnacle\u2019s Brands?","Sean Connolly","I don\u2019t, right now, envision that Bryan. Again, we spend a lot of time talking to the street around the concepts of total marketing spend, which include dollars above net sales and below net sales. In my estimation, there is plenty of investment in these branded assets you cannot see all of it in AMP that AMP line, as you can see, looks fairly lien. But there is a significant amount of spend above the line. A lot of that is different from the way we spend at ConAgra trade above the line, which is really in high quality retailer oriented marketing programs. There is a lot of promotional behavior here.","And as we pointed out, one of the first things we did when we close the deal is we killed a lot of deep discount highly inefficient promotion deals. Since you reminded me greatly of some of the bad habits we had to break at ConAgra when I first got here, it was Pinnacle chasing volume over value. So, there is inefficiency baked into the existing spending base. We\u2019ve got to extract that inefficiency. We\u2019ve got redeployed it against high quality brand building product improvements, packaging improvements, brand architecture improvements, all the stuff that we talked about.","And so I am very confident in our ability to do this, because we have built, over the last four years what I think is industry leading analytics, insights and innovation capability. And we\u2019re incredibly flexible and agile organization reflects to the work. So it is abundantly clear now where we\u2019ve got to flex to. We\u2019ve already begun that as you can imagine and now we\u2019ve got played out.","Bryan Spillane","And Dave just quick one on the credit ratings. So is part of -- I imagine part of the discussions with the rating agencies initially in terms of your rating was giving a path towards getting the deleveraging down to the 3.5 target. So I guess as where starting point is lower than you originally thought, is the path important? Meaning, is there a certain level of EBITDA that you're going to have to deliver in fiscal '20 in order to maintain that investment grade? Or is there a risk that that might slip if you don't deliver a certain amount even in fiscal \u201820.","David Marberger ","So as Sean and I both commented, we\u2019re strongly committed to the solid investment grade. We're at 5 times levered at the end of the second quarter, which is where we expect it to be. So with EBITDA off a little bit, we've also come out and have a lower debt. So we've maintained that ratio. Based on our updated estimates of EBITDA and the debt pay down, we have a clear path towards the 3.5 times leverage through the end of '21. But we also have other levers to generate cash for debt pay down. For example, working capital improvement on Pinnacle is a big opportunity, and then just general contingencies we build into our CapEx budget. So we feel comfortable that we have the clear path and flexibility to manage to the target.","Operator","The last question today comes from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale","Thanks for squeezing me. My question is related to structural versus transitory issue. That the industry and ConAgra is facing in the context of the fact that markets value and the entire industry and ConAgra has structurally flawed. So I'd like to ask two questions, one related to the Pinnacle business and one related to the base business in that context right. So you're probably aware of our view, which is that execution is really the big winner for the large CPGs rather than really brand equity erosion. So with Pinnacle, I mean there's a long history here of really good innovation and really good brand building, a very long history and it's been best-in-class, right. And so it seems like the markets are a little bit confused, because your commentary was pretty harsh on the near-term performance. So maybe you can give us an example of the innovation not hitting the mark and how that's execution versus structural. So that's on the legacy -- on the Pinnacle business? And then on your base business, which you lost in all the Pinnacle focus. Aren\u2019t you actually seeing the execution getting better, right? You've executed better. Pricing is ahead of investments on retailer initiatives. Aren't we actually now seeing the fact that if you execute on a portfolio strategy, the brand is actually in good shape. So help me on that if you can. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Akshay, I don't think there should be any confusion here. We fully agree with your statement that when you have iconic legacy brands, they're not entitled to performance they are capable of performance. And they're capable of performance depending upon whether or not the enterprise can innovate them in ways that drive good profitability and do a fantastic job delighting the consumer. When you look at what we've done with our ConAgra Brands over the last four years, we have taken brands that were once iconic that many folks had written off, like a banquet or a healthy choice. We've dramatically modernized them. We\u2019ve dramatically modernize. We\u2019ve improve the margins. We\u2019ve raised the price points to levels no one felt was possible. And the brands are growing at audacious clips now, some of the north of 20%. And so, that\u2019s a good example of exactly what you\u2019re saying.","Pinnacle, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks, has had equal kinds of success in the past. But just because you\u2019re successful in any given window, doesn\u2019t mean that that brand is entitled for that success to carry on forever. Each year brand folks brand companies like ours bring new innovations in the marketplace or have the opportunity to, or they can pass and they can let their brands atrophy. They can also innovate superior innovations or they could innovate subpar innovations.","And so clearly the prove is always in the pudding. I would say, my commentary was not harsh but the results in the marketplace were harsh. And that is what we\u2019ve got to correct with the exactly the same as you\u2019re talking about, which is a return to superior execution on the three key leadership brands that we talked about today. It means not missing big consumer opportunities like spiralized with Birds Eye. It equally means making sure the execution is really buttoned up to communicate the benefit that is being delivered to the consumer. So for example, Duncan Hines, Mug Treats being positioned as sweet treat not as portion size cake. These may sound like nuance but they are very important to repeat purchase and the size of the market you create to household penetration, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got to go do.","Akshay Jagdale","So, just one follow up related to Pinnacle. So, the issues we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace given the impending transaction and the back and forth that went about. Can we -- given the previously five years of really solid execution. How much of it is just execution related to that driven by distractions, right? Is it a good chunk of what\u2019s happening and that\u2019s what gives you confidence that it can be reversed?","Sean Connolly","Well, I\u2019ll leave the prognostication as to what the root cause is up to you guys. What I\u2019m going to stay focused is putting all of our energy and getting these brands right where they are. What I\u2019m telling you is what we\u2019re seeing is entirely executional in nature and not structural in nature. And given that, we\u2019re going to put all our energy in getting these businesses where they need to be as fast as generally possible.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.  This morning, we'll talk about fiscal 2012 fourth quarter performance and our outlook for fiscal 2013. And then we'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.","Before we get started, Chris has a few opening remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and affect our business, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.  Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the question-and-answer document, or on our website under the Financial Reports and Filings link and then choosing Non-GAAP Reconciliations.","For Regulation G purposes, I will clarify that we reported a loss of $0.21 per share for the fiscal fourth quarter. The loss is due to the year-end expense associated with the pension accounting change. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, fiscal fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.51, that's an increase of 9% over comparable year-ago amounts.","I'll also remind our listeners that the associated question-and-answer document, which is filed as an Exhibit on our Form 8-K and on our website has commentary explanatory details and financial tables intended to clarify the pension accounting change discussed in today's release. This will assist with any changes to historical models.","I will touch on this topic very briefly now and let John offer more detail in his comments. And then we'll also refer you to the supplemental information for help with financial models and other housekeeping related aspects. In a nutshell, we adopted changes in pension accounting to provide a clearer picture of the underlying operating results of our business. These changes impact current and prior periods. Here's a summary.","The biggest of these changes involves mark-to-market accounting for pension liabilities. For context, in a low interest rate environment, pension liabilities increase, and this results in additional expense. To be clear, that is expense created by the mechanics of the debt market as opposed to anything related to our fundamental operations.","Under the old method, we had been amortizing that additional expense over several years in our ongoing results. With the new method of accounting, we recognize the additional expense all at once at the end of the fiscal year. This new method provides more clarity for those analyzing our underlying financial performance, and it is also a preferable accounting method.","The recently adopted mark-to-market accounting gave us year-end expense of $0.60 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and year-end expense of $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.  Those are shown as items impacting comparability. Because we no longer amortize pension-related actuarial gains and losses in our ongoing results, we have removed pension-related amortization from past results, and this, along with other aspects of the changes, has revised the EPS base as presented in prior periods.","Along these lines, fiscal 2012 earnings per share benefited by $0.08 per share. That's for the full year. And it includes $0.02 per share in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2011 earnings per share benefited by $0.01 for these same reasons.","Our revised EPS base, adjusted for items impacting comparability, is now $1.76 for fiscal 2011 and $1.84 for fiscal 2012. The new methodology in place as a result of these accounting changes will apply to past and future results, and thus enable fair comparisons.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. As you can see from the release, EPS on a comparable basis was $0.51 for the fourth quarter. That's up 9% year-over-year. The $0.51 of comparable earnings includes a $0.02 benefit from our pension change, as Chris touched on and as described in the release.","We posted comparable year-over-year EPS growth for our fiscal fourth quarter as we planned, and we showed full year EPS growth also. Our EPS base for fiscal 2012 is $1.84 adjusted for items impacting comparability, that's with the pension noise out of it, and we expect to grow 6% to 8% on top of that in fiscal 2013, adjusted for items impacting comparability.","Now I'd like to share a few more details on our fiscal fourth quarter results for both our Consumer Foods and our Commercial Foods segments. For the last quarter of fiscal 2012, we grew comparable operating profit in Consumer Foods, a significant sequential improvement. This was an important milestone, and we're glad to have turned the corner in terms of year-over-year profit comparisons. As we've talked before, the commodity inflation during the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year was very high, at 11%, and it moderated to 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter. A combination of our prior pricing actions, along with the productivity improvements have helped us fight the inflation headwinds.","Contribution from our acquisitions this fiscal year also played a role in fourth quarter results, but our base business showed an increase in profitability in the fourth quarter, even without the benefit of acquisitions.","The big challenge continues to be shopper behavior and its impact on industry volumes. Specifically, shoppers continue to be extremely value-conscious with their choices at the grocery store. You've heard from us and others that shoppers are sticking to a list, expecting significant value for everything and keeping food inventories at home to a minimum. They're being frugal and eating more leftovers. All in all, a pretty difficult environment for fiscal 2012, and we're being realistic about the environment going forward.","Clearly, our portfolio includes many choices that are great values to shoppers, and we need to appropriately leverage that by working hard to generate consumer pull with a combination of innovation and marketing. More on that in a moment.","For the fiscal fourth quarter, sales for Consumer Foods increased 6% due to acquisitions. Organic sales were up slightly as price mix added 6% and volume declined about 5%.","Given my prior comments about the environment, it's also worth pointing out that a meaningful portion of our fourth quarter volume decline was driven by one brand, Banquet, which weighs very heavily in our overall volume performance given that it's the largest volume brand in our Consumer Foods portfolio. As a reminder, we took pricing on Banquet earlier this fiscal year to deal with commodity inflation, and as a result, the retail price charged by customers crossed the $1 price point at most retailers. With value-oriented consumers being hit the hardest in this economy, there was volume decline as a result of this pricing, but the increase was the right thing to do to address inflation and keep Banquet profits healthy. Banquet accounted for about 2 points of the 5-point volume decline.","We're satisfied with our pricing actions this year. This work is continually being refined as part of our Customer Connect initiatives you've heard us discuss before. We're developing a greater confidence in the analytics and systems that make our pricing architecture stronger over the long term. We're also focused on more consistent levels of investment in advertising and promotion, which is an essential component of creating consumer pull for our products. This is very important in an environment where consumers continue to be highly selective with their choices.","We had a number of brands that performed well during the quarter. Marie Callender's continued its success with multi-serve meals driving good year-over-year growth and desserts growing at a double-digit rate. It's hard to say enough about the growth of this franchise and the way it's grown share. During the quarter, Marie Callender's single-serve meals grew about 10% for the quarter in both net sales and volume, significantly better than the category.","Healthy Choice also gained share and grew net sales during the quarter, even with the impact of net pricing. The Healthy Choice Top Chef flavors have done very well. Another demonstration that the flavor, texture and visual appeal we deliver with our steaming platform gives us differentiation in this important product line. We aim to take advantage of that demand for premium taste with one of our new product lines, Healthy Choice baked entr\u00e9es, which begins shipping next week.","Our new Greek frozen yogurt from Healthy Choice starts shipping next week as well. You may remember that product from CAGNY. This is one that we're pretty excited about as it over-delivers on taste and texture and has only 100 calories per serving.","Those are just a couple of examples of our innovation pipeline generating new products to grow our brands and categories. We'll have more to talk about throughout the year, and we'll keep you updated on the progress of our new items.","We're excited about supplementing our organic growth from innovation and marketing with the right acquisitions. As we've said, we're looking for smart acquisitions that have organic growth upside, operational and marketplace synergies, and which will add to earnings growth and returns on capital over time, which is the thinking that drove the recent acquisitions of National Pretzel and Del Monte Canada and the increased investment in Agro Tech Foods, all of which we discussed earlier this fiscal year.","In our fourth quarter, we added 2 product lines that fit our strategic objectives. The first is Odom's Tennessee Pride, which helps build out our breakfast offerings. This business has a line of terrific frozen breakfast sandwiches, and we believe that's a platform on which we can build. Frozen breakfast is a growing category, and the Odom's capabilities are a great fit for our strategy because they help us establish a position in a category that's adjacent to our core business.","The second is the pita chip business of Kangaroo Brands. Snacks are growing, private label is expanding, and we want to grow this small but attractive business in a significant way. These are really great tasting pita chips with attractive nutrition. The pita chips segment is an area where we previously didn't have presence, and this product type, much like pretzels, has a good-for-you appeal to consumers. The Kangaroo Brand pita chips are featured in the deli section of stores, so that adds some presence there for us. And the private label chips are in the snack aisle, where we aim to grow our space.","Our private label business continues to do well overall, with the nutrition and snack bar business continuing to grow rapidly, and we're excited about opportunities to expand this business in the right way through organic growth and through strategic acquisitions. We think of this business as a consumer-centric store brands business, a more contemporary and differentiating version of old private label models. We apply a CPG mindset to the way we do business here, with consumer and shopper insights that we think help identify categories with good growth and margin potential.","Along with our innovation, food safety and supply chain expertise, this enables deeper customer partnerships, and that translates into improved sales and profitability.","Moving on to Commercial Foods, sales and profits for the segment increased largely due to the strength of Lamb Weston potato operations. Lamb Weston posted good volume results and good price mix due to pricing taken earlier in the year to deal with inflation.","Commercial Foods sales were up 7% in aggregate due to Lamb Weston's progress, but also due to good flour milling volumes. Segment profits grew 7%, reflecting the sales growth as well as favorable product mix, notably from continued momentum in sweet potatoes and operating efficiencies. These factors in aggregate more than offset challenging market conditions for the milling operations.","All in all, Lamb Weston had a great year, and we're really pleased with the momentum this business is once again demonstrating. The Lamb Weston team's success for the year reflects good management of raw supplies, outstanding customer partnerships, pricing agility, strong exports, notably in the Middle East and Asia, and continued expansion into the fast-growing sweet potato adjacency.","As you heard us say at CAGNY, this business now has an international footprint of more than $1 billion annually. That's taking into account our share of the sales of unconsolidated joint ventures. We're in a position to accelerate that growth. We have terrific relationships with multinational restaurant chains that are growing, and that's good for our business. We've also seen somewhat of a rebound in the quick serve restaurant business in the U.S., and that of course helps.","But more than anything, the strength at Lamb Weston reflects a seasoned group of operators who are attuned to the marketplace, skilled at seizing opportunities and have the ability to deal with changing dynamics. They're committed to providing excellent service to their customers, and it shows. Along those lines, just last week, Lamb Weston received a SYSCO Supplier Excellence Award, recognizing them as the #1 Gold Supplier in the Frozen category. This is the second year in a row they've won this award. Suffice to say that Lamb Weston is on top of its game and we expect that momentum to carry into fiscal 2013 and make a strong contribution to EPS growth.","I'll wrap up fiscal 2012 remarks by saying that while the broader business conditions were difficult, particularly in our Consumer Foods segment, fiscal '12 was a year of operating progress on a number of fronts. Specifically, I'm talking about pricing in both segments, strong productivity, promising innovation and a significant turnaround at Lamb Weston. As we look to fiscal year '13, we expect to grow 6% to 8% off the fiscal 2012 EPS base of $1.84 adjusted for items impacting comparability.","While branded retail marketplace conditions will still be challenging, we're planning for good earnings growth for a number of reasons. First, we'll have the benefit of acquisitions completed in fiscal 2012. That's in the range of half the EPS growth we're expecting. We also have ongoing momentum from Lamb Weston, and we feel very good about that. Third, we expect to see benefit to Consumer Foods margins as a result of effective margin management and less severe inflation.","A little context on our outlook for the Consumer Foods segment in fiscal 2013. It's worth pointing out that as we progress through the year, we will lap the price increases we took in fiscal 2012. This will benefit the year-over-year organic volume comparisons in the second half of the year. Though we do expect sequentially improving volume trends in the back half of the year, not only because of the lapping of pricing actions but also because of the benefit of innovation introduced earlier in the year.","It's also worth noting that while acquisitions completed in fiscal 2012 are expected to generate the majority of Consumer Foods' profit growth in fiscal '13, that's not the only driver of profit improvement in our plans for that segment. We also expect modest profit growth from that segment's core underlying operations, meaning the base business independent of acquisitions. We're realistic about marketplace conditions, but margin management initiatives and moderating inflation could put us in a position to post modest profit improvement and invest more in marketing for the core underlying operations.","Before I wrap up, I do want to remind you that we will continue to be proactive with our strong balance sheet in pursuit of strategic acquisitions that build shareholder value over the long term. All in all, we're confident that our 6% to 8% EPS goal for fiscal year '13 is achievable, and I look forward to keeping you updated on that as we look forward this fiscal year.","Now I'll turn the call over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on 5 topics this morning. I'll begin with our pension accounting change so that I can ground everyone on a few key elements, including the financial statement impacts. Second, I'll discuss our fourth quarter performance highlights. Next, I'll address comparability matters, and then onto cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, including some details on our recent acquisition activity. And finally, I will provide some comments on our outlook for fiscal 2013.","So let me start with the accounting change around pensions. While we've included some detailed information in the release materials, and Chris has also shared some of the mechanics with you, I would like to cover a few key points here.","First, our objective. Our objective in making the change is simply put, to provide better transparency to the financial performance of our core business operations. Our prior methodology has resulted in significant impacts to our earnings that reflect neither our underlying performance, nor the cash flow realities with respect to the pension.","Next, as Chris noted, the change has 2 significant impacts on our financial statements. First, during the past 2 years we have had, and from time to time going forward we may have, fourth quarter actuarial or mark-to-market losses or gains that we will treat as comparability items. Second, we have removed from our financial statements the amortization of actuarial losses and potentially gains, and we believe that the elimination of this amortization under the new method will improve transparency.","Under the new method, our normalized pension expense is comprised principally of 3 components: service cost, interest cost on the pension liability, offset by the investment returns on our pension assets. I would also note that while we considered various options to address the pension expense volatility, we ultimately concluded that this change, and what is deemed to be a preferable accounting method, would best serve our stakeholders.","And before we leave this topic, I'd like to emphasize a few other points that are also included in our release materials. First, we are very comfortable with our pension funding level. We made a discretionary pension contribution of about $250 million during our fiscal fourth quarter, and as of fiscal 2012 year end, our funding level was approximately 83%, and that's despite interest and discount rates being at historic lows.","Second, while there are some large charges flowing through the income statement with the application -- in connection with the application of this change in accounting, there is no net impact on our balance sheet. In other words, our assets and liabilities, and therefore our net equity, are all unaffected by this change, including the related year-end charges treated as items impacting comparability. Also, the change has no impact on cash flows or pension funding requirements.","And lastly, all of the impacts of the accounting change are reflected in our corporate segment. So the results of our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods operating segments are unaffected.","I would refer you also to the release materials, which contain additional details regarding the change, including a number of tables which will assist users in bridging to the new earnings base.","Now let's turn to our next topic, the fourth quarter performance highlights. Starting with our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $2.1 billion, up about 6%, reflecting 6 points of favorable price mix and a benefit of about 6 points from acquisitions. These factors were partially offset by a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange and a 5% base volume decline. As Gary noted, about 2 points of this base volume decline was related to the volume impacts from pricing taken on our Banquet brand.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $288 million, or up about 7% from the year-ago period. While the acquisitions contributed to the operating profit growth, most of the growth came from margin improvement in the base business, driven by pricing and cost savings, offset by moderating inflation.","For the fiscal fourth quarter, we experienced inflation of about 6%, with a good portion of that driven by proteins. Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results, and they delivered cost savings of approximately $80 million in the quarter. These programs delivered over $275 million of cost savings for the full fiscal year.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $74 million, essentially flat with the prior-year quarter. And for the full fiscal year, A&P was about $335 million, or 3% below the prior year.","For the quarter, foreign exchange had an immaterial impact on Consumer Foods operating profit.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion, or up 7%, reflecting improved volume and mix, as well as disciplined pricing in our Lamb Weston potato operations, where we increased prices to offset higher input costs.  The impact on sales from the pass-through of wheat costs in the milling operations was immaterial this quarter.","The segment's operating profit increased 7% to $138 million. Lamb Weston posted a strong double-digit rate of profit growth, driven by favorable volumes and pricing mix, as well as production efficiencies. The profit growth for Lamb Weston was partially offset by a profit decline in the milling operations, and while sales volumes increased in the milling operations, profits were lower due to less favorable market conditions.","Overall, we are pleased with the performance of this segment and believe these businesses are well positioned for fiscal 2013.","Corporate expenses, adjusted for items impacting comparability, were $64 million for the quarter versus $61 million in the year-ago quarter. As previously noted, corporate expense reflects the impact of the pension accounting change for all periods. The tax rate for the year on comparable earnings was in line with our expectations.","Now I'll move on to my third topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have $0.72 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter's EPS related to several items. First, we recorded $397 million, or $0.60 per share of pension expense related to the actuarial or mark-to-market losses in connection with our new pension accounting method. Second, on hedging for the fiscal fourth quarter, the net hedging loss included in corporate expense was $53 million, or $0.08 per share. Next, we recorded $13 million, or $0.02 per share, of restructuring and other one-time charges related to our cost reduction and organizational efficiency initiatives, principally in our Consumer Foods segment. Fourth, we recorded approximately $7 million, or $0.01 per share, of acquisition-related expenses. And finally, we recorded $0.02 of income, offset by $0.02 of expense related to several legal and insurance matters which relate to prior years.","Next, I'll cover my fourth topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with approximately $103 million of cash on hand and approximately $40 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. While our cash balance has come down quite a bit over the past several quarters, the decrease is primarily a function of putting our cash to work. In fact, during fiscal 2012, we deployed about $1 billion to fund acquisitions and share repurchases.","For fiscal year 2012, we delivered operating cash flows of approximately $1.05 billion. This performance was consistent with our expectations after taking into account the impact of approximately $250 million of discretionary pension contributions, which are included in operating cash flows.","On working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full fiscal year, working capital improvement in our base business contributed over $100 million to cash flow from operating activities as we continued to improve our cash conversion cycle metrics.","On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $98 million versus $119 million in the prior-year period. And for the full fiscal year, CapEx was approximately $340 million, which is down from our previous estimate of about $400 million. The decline relates principally to changes in timing on several capital projects.","Net interest expense was $51 million in the fourth quarter versus $55 million in the year-ago quarter. And dividends for the quarter increased slightly from the year-ago quarter to $100 million, reflecting the increased dividend rate, offset by a lower number of shares.","Now let's turn to capital allocation and let's start with growth. We have said that growth is a priority and that we are focused on strategic adjacencies, international and private label. During the quarter, we completed 3 transactions that are consistent with our growth strategy. First, we completed the acquisition of Del Monte Canada for approximately $186 million. We also completed the acquisition of Odom's Tennessee Pride for approximately $95 million. And finally, we acquired Kangaroo Brands' private label pita chip business for approximately $48 million. As Gary discussed in his comments, we are very excited to have each of these in our portfolio, and they really fit well with our growth pillars of adjacencies, international and private label.","For the full fiscal year, we deployed approximately $700 million to fund acquisitions and related growth investments. Going forward, we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities where there is a strategic fit and a good financial return. And we are confident that we can further leverage our capabilities and our strong balance sheet to create value by investing for growth in a disciplined manner. We also remain focused on organic growth and profit enhancement investments, including investments to support innovation and our cost savings initiatives.","The other elements of our balanced capital allocation approach also remain unchanged. This approach starts with our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating but also recognizes the importance of maintaining our strong dividend and executing share repurchases from time to time. And on share repurchases, we purchased about $250 million of our shares in the fiscal fourth quarter, and we currently have approximately $525 million of available share repurchase authorization.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2013 outlook. As Gary mentioned, we expect fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow at a rate in line with our long-term algorithm of 6% to 8% from our new fiscal 2012 base of $1.84 per share. This fiscal 2013 earnings estimate reflects net sales growth at a rate in the mid-single digits. Sales growth for the Consumer Foods segment is planned to be in the high single digits, with about 2\/3 coming from our recent acquisitions. And in our Commercial Foods segment, we expect modest top line growth as volume, pricing and mix improvements in the segment will be offset by the impact of lower wheat prices in our milling business.","This fiscal 2013 estimate also reflects modest gross margin improvement in our Consumer Foods segment, driven by pricing and mix improvements and strong cost savings, partially offset by the impact of inflation, which we do expect to moderate over the course of the year.","For fiscal 2013, we expect cost savings of about $240 million in our Consumer Foods business. And we are planning for an increase in our advertising and promotion costs of more than 10% to support our consumer brands and new product introductions.","Also, consistent with our pay-for-performance approach, total company SG&A reflects higher incentive costs, given the expected margin and comparable earnings per share improvement in fiscal 2013.","Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be in the range of 34% for the full year, although this rate may fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.","So with respect to the operating profit performance of our business segments, for fiscal 2013, we expect improved operating profit in our Consumer Foods segment, and while we anticipate that more than half of that profit growth will come from our recent acquisitions, we also expect growth in our base business, driven by pricing and mix improvements and supply chain cost reductions, offset by higher marketing expense.","In our Commercial Foods segment, we believe both Lamb Weston and our flour milling operations will deliver solid operating profit growth. Lamb Weston is entering the year with strong momentum, and ConAgra Mills is also well positioned for earnings growth in 2013.","Turning to cash flow, we expect continued strength in our operating cash flows in fiscal 2013. We expect cash flows from operating activities to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, including a modest contribution from working capital improvement. Further, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $450 million for fiscal 2013.","In summary, we expect EPS, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow in the range of 6% to 8% next year, consistent with our long-term algorithm. And we are optimistic about the long-term strength of our businesses.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Andr\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions.","I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Lots of questions. I think I'll leave a few to the people who are going to come after me and get into a couple of detailed things here. Gross margins in the Consumer Foods segment, were they up, down or flat this quarter?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Jason this is Andr\u00e9. They were up this quarter.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So the decline was primarily driven by Commercial Foods in aggregate? Is that just a factor of the milling stuff you talked about?","Chris Klinefelter","Jason, this is Chris. For \u2013 you're talking about for the total company, our fourth quarter margins were up slightly year-over-year, all segments included. So if you got a different number, we'll be glad to talk about it offline.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, we do have a different number, so I will circle back offline to try to get some of the adjustments corrected on that one. And last question. Your acquisitions, are they margin accretive to your Commercial Food business or are they diluting the margins right now?","Chris Klinefelter","Jason, it's Chris. I believe you mean the Consumer Foods.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Consumer Foods, yes.","Chris Klinefelter","Yes, we would expect them certainly to be accretive to our profits.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But to margins?","Chris Klinefelter","Yes, they will be margins over time. I don't have the details here sitting in terms of the pieces that fell under the quarter. But over time, that's the objective.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to go back, Gary, onto the organic growth in Consumer Foods. So it seems like just from the guidance, it's very limited organic growth in the Consumer Foods in F '13. Can you spend a little bit more time and talk about why? And I did hear, I guess, at the end part of the script a fairly large increase in advertising. Is that the #1 factor to call out here for the organic growth rate being -- it's got to be embedded in the guidance at maybe 1% of EPS growth, something like that?","Gary M. Rodkin","Well, David, in Consumer, we clearly have talked about how volume will be modestly down this year, but it will improve as the year goes on and we overlap the pricing. Obviously, we've talked an awful lot about shopper behavior across the industry buying less units, exacerbated by the significant price increases taken this year. And in our case, we singled out Banquet moving over $1, impacting volume to the tune of about 40% of our volume drop this year. But those moves, those pricing moves, are the right thing holistically certainly from an overall financial standpoint. We're going to overlap those pricing actions as we get through the year, and eventually we'll also start to hopefully see consumers flatten out in terms of their behavior on what kind of inventory they're carrying and how they're managing their leftovers. That's going to flatten out over time. But we're planning realistically and we're very, very confident in the algorithm. The margins will improve this year in Consumer because we clearly are going to have less severe inflation. We're moving more towards pull versus push. And that's why you see us committing to a realistic increase in our marketing dollars. But overall, we feel very good about our Consumer Foods business. We will see some modest growth on the organic business side, and we will get a good boost from our acquisitions.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Well, 2 quick follow-ups. On the pace of volume declines, can you talk a little bit about March, April, May, and then what you've seen in June so far? Is it consistently negative or are you seeing a trend that's maybe suggesting improvement?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, David, this is Andr\u00e9. I would say that to your question, in terms of what we saw in the fourth quarter, I think I'll just repeat what Gary mentioned. Again, the lion's share of that volume decline was in a brand we took pricing actions on that's very, very sensitive, and that was Banquet. In terms of consumer consumption, as we read the Scan data as well as the All Outlet data, I would say we've seen a slight improvement. But to Gary's point, the consumer sentiment is still where it is. We are not seeing unit consumption growth rates yet across all channels of our business. So I would say it's still kind of the environment that Gary discussed.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I could take a final question. And just on this promotional spending or advertising and promotional spending increase, I assume by promotion, that's consumer promotion, not trade promotion. And the 10% increase, can you just describe a little bit the logic behind such a large increase?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Well, a couple things, David. This is Andr\u00e9 again. I would say what we're talking about here is we have a lot of innovation that we're bringing to market in fiscal year '13. That is going to require some of the products that Gary articulated. That's going to require, we believe, some consumer promotion. We also feel very good about some of our brands where we've taken pricing this year, and we've continued to gain share because we have a consumer preferred product. And we want to continue to make those investments. They'll be choiceful, they'll be in big categories where we can make a difference. They'll also span some of the new items, new types of marketing such as digital and other things that we're really pushing really hard on.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. And the final point I would add, again, as we are trying to shift away from being more push-oriented toward more pull. So the total dollars, it's buckets that change, it's not really total increased spend.","Operator","We'll move now to Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, one of the great strengths, and I think probably underappreciated sometimes by the market, is the balance sheet flexibility that you have. And you demonstrated it with acquisitions, which are going to benefit this year. On share repurchases, can you just talk a little bit about what drove your decision to repurchase as much stock as you did in the quarter? I'm glad that you did it, but just I'm trying to get a better understanding of what drives the decision-making there in terms of when you decide to go forward and buy back stock.","John F. Gehring","Well, Bryan, this is John. First of all, I don't think we're -- none of this is kind of episodic or short-term thinking. I think if you look at the full year, we purchased about $360 million of shares. The timing really, in some ways was a function of how much we had done previously, and I think as you recall, in some of the previous quarters, we were focusing a lot of our cash and investment in the M&A markets. And I'd say another factor is while on a net basis, we do buy back a significant positive in terms of shares, we also look at the amount of option exercises we have during the year that puts some excess cash to us and we wanted to redeploy some of that back. So I think some of it was just getting back to where we expect it to be on a full year basis. And we saw the opportunity in the fourth quarter to do that.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Are there any additional share repurchases embedded in your guidance expectations for this year, for fiscal '13?","John F. Gehring","Yes, I'm not going to get into specific expectations about share repurchase. What I would say is that if you look at just total capital allocation as we look at our algorithm every year, we do expect there to be a few cents of lift from capital allocation. That may come in the form of acquisitions. It may also come in the form of share repurchases or a combination thereof.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on cost inflation for fiscal '13, I might have missed it. Did you give a cost inflation? Did you put a number on what you're expecting commodity inflation to be for fiscal '13?","John F. Gehring","Yes. This is John. I think I would say in the range of 5%, maybe 4% to 6% as we sit here today. Obviously, the markets are still moving around, so I don't want to get too precise in my prediction. But clearly, it's in a range that while we'd always like it to be lower, we feel that, that's a range that our business can operate much better at than double digits.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just a rough idea of how much of that is locked in and how much could move around?","John F. Gehring","I don't think we go into those kinds of details. Suffice it to say, we have a fairly proactive procurement capability, and we're looking probably every day, every week where the markets are moving and how to hedge our positions.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then Gary, just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Just, Gary, as you look into fiscal '13, you've got your plan and your guidance. Is your business plan for this year based on an expectation that the industry environment stays the same, gets worse or improves?","Gary M. Rodkin","I would say to be realistic or conservative, it's pretty much staying the same. Our plan is really based on 3 key factors. That's the moderating inflation we'll see in consumer, so we'll get the margin improvement there. It's the continued traction that we have on the Lamb Weston business. And it's the benefit of having the acquisitions that we did in fiscal '12 for all of the full year in fiscal '13. So when we put those 3 together, we feel very confident in our algorithm.","Operator","We'll hear now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Scott Mushkin sitting in for Thilo as he's over in Europe right now. A couple questions I want to follow up on. To Dave Driscoll's point about volumes lately, any hints that Banquet is starting to see their volume trends get a little bit better? And I guess what I'm getting at here is that we've seen gas prices come down. I was wondering if the consumers, I think you said it's maybe slightly better. But any hints that the kind of the lower end of the consumer's feeling a little bit better?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Scott, this is Andr\u00e9. No, we haven't seen that. I would say that our expectations and the way we built the models and the way we built our algorithm for next year, as Gary touched on, we see us obviously lapping that pricing sometime in the back half of next year or fiscal '13, I should say. So that's when we believe that the consumer will see some improvement in that business. That's pretty much been -- it's pretty much followed what our model said. So no, I have not seen any improvement.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then I know you -- and to Brian's question, you said you're expecting about 4% to 6% cost inflation. Is that going to cause need for further pricing actions or no?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","A couple things, Scott. We obviously, as John mentioned, we look at the commodity markets every day, and we'll be -- we have built a whole lot more pricing muscle in this organization as a result of the work we've done around Customer Connect. So where we'll need to -- we're specifically watching proteins, which continue to have a fair amount of inflation behind them. But I would say that, that's what we're looking at. The inflation numbers, you've got to remember we have very robust cost savings initiatives as well that have continued to deliver for the last 4 to 5 years here. And we're going to continue to leverage those as we fight inflation for next year. That's going to be the bulk of the fight against inflation, but we are prepared to price in places where we see our margins getting adversely impacted.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So to paraphrase is if you can get away without doing it through cost saves, you will. But if you have to, you have to. Is that a good paraphrase?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, I would say we're going to watch the marketplace. I mean, I think we've built a lot of muscle now, and we've got a lot of people that are focused on this, so we will act accordingly depending on what the marketplace gives us.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I have one more, and I apologize if you actually said this in your remarks. But the acquisition outlook, another year of bolt-ons or how should we think of acquisitions?","Gary M. Rodkin","We have a very clear strategy and a lot of discipline around our M&A strategy. And it's got to be opportunities that come up, that fit strategically, leverage the kind of capabilities we have, very importantly, offer us growth from a category standpoint and will be top and bottom line accretive over time. So if those opportunities come up, we're ready to leverage the balance sheet again.","John F. Gehring","Yes. And this is John. Just to add on to that. It's not about size; it's about the opportunities and the returns we can get. So I'd say we're somewhat agnostic to size. There's obviously practical limits, but it's really about the things Gary talked about.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I guess just the first question is, and hopefully I'm doing the numbers right here, but the implied guidance off of the $1.84 new adjusted EPS implies $1.85, I guess, to $1.89 for '13. If we back out the $0.08 from the $1.84, we get to $1.76. So the question I have is, in the release you said you'd expect basically half of that -- half of the $0.13 upside coming from acquisitions. But if we use the old number, the $1.76, that's still implying 11% to 13% percent growth for the year. So would you still expect out of that 11% to 13% growth that half of that would be coming from acquisitions? Or am I just not thinking about this the right way?","Chris Klinefelter","Rob, this is Chris. I think the clearest thing to do is just to say our base is what our base is. It's $1.84, and that's how we've crafted our comments. So when you look at the implied growth off of that, that's what we were discussing in terms of the estimate of roughly half. But again, that is an estimate of roughly. We're not trying to draw it precisely to the $0.01 of exactly half.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay, fine, and then a follow-up to that. Within your Consumer Foods segment, when you said the $240 million in cost savings inherent in that, are there cost savings from the acquisitions or are we not seeing too many cost synergies from the deals you've already done?","John F. Gehring","All right. This is John, and I'll -- yes, there are -- we do expect to drive costs and capture synergies when go through these deals. I'd say all the deals have some level of synergies whether it be SG&A or whether it be supply chain matters. I'd also note that when we do these deals, there are -- from time to time, we also make decisions to the front end to address in those businesses further. So I'd say it's -- we certainly would expect to have some synergies out of those deals.","Operator","Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my, I guess, operating questions have been answered, so I want to understand the pension changes a little bit more. So is this kind of like what Hershey did, which was adopt the IFRS? Or are you still on a GAAP system?","John F. Gehring","This is John, Eric. We -- I'm somewhat familiar with what Hershey did, but not expert on it. What we did is we are staying with GAAP. So ours is a GAAP method. It's not a hybrid of GAAP and comparability. It's just a straight GAAP method that a number of other companies over the past 12 to 18 months have adopted also.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so what was the expense hit that you were looking at using the old method that was, I guess, so significant and volatile based on the lower interest rates and return assumptions? Like what would that negative, and I realize it's noncash, but what would that negative expense have been?","John F. Gehring","I'm not sure I can answer that. Let me start it this way. You saw what happened to our FY '12 earnings base going from $1.76 to $1.84. So that's about $0.08 in the past fiscal year that it was impacting us by. Once we changed the accounting method going forward, we're now on the new accounting method, and so I don't have a number that says hypothetically, '13 or '14 would've been x, y or z. I think it's logical to conclude it would have been something higher just because of the further decline in interest rates. But the way we look at this now is we've got a new base, the amortization is out of that base in all future periods. And so when we look at our operations and the results we expect, it's much cleaner, and there's no either hidden tailwind or headwind in those numbers.","Operator","And Sanford Bernstein's Alexia Howard has our next question.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask first of all, are you able to break out what the underlying profit growth excluding acquisitions was in the Consumer segment?","Chris Klinefelter","We have -- Alexia, this is Chris. Obviously, we have that detail. What I'll tell you is that the business would have been up at a modest rate, even without acquisitions. Acquisitions were a role, but they -- I mean, order of magnitude, they weren't even half the growth.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. That's really helpful. And on the Lamb Weston business, could you give us a little bit more detail about exactly where that growth is coming from, what channels, what type of customers and which regions are you seeing the biggest strength in?","John F. Gehring","Sure. I would just kind of start with the organization is very focused on our customers, and that focus is paying off. There is some growth domestically and a lot of that growth is driven by product mix. And you heard Gary talk about sweet potatoes, and that continues to be a very positive light. But a lot of the growth is coming from emerging markets outside the U.S. and outside of Europe. And we're very aligned with our customers in supporting that growth. And frankly, a lot of the effort over the last 18 months has been with our team, effectively managing through the dynamics that we deal with year-over-year in a crop-based business. And our ability to do that and improve our ability to work to those dynamics has been a big part of that focus. But feel real good about our alignment with customers and where we're headed.","Operator","We have a question now from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Marcela Giraldo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Marcela for Rob. So in line with Bryan's question before, do you feel that this year's guidance comes in the context of a tougher environment? Meaning specifically, is the guidance for the rate of [ph] business maybe more conservative this year versus previous years?","Gary M. Rodkin","I would say our guidance is what we believe is appropriate for this year. We feel very confident in that 6% to 8%, and I wouldn't say that it leans in one direction or another.","Marcela Giraldo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up, if I may. You mentioned some rebound in QSRs in the U.S. Is that something you are factoring into your Commercial segment guidance for this year?","Gary M. Rodkin","Well, we certainly are expecting another very good year for Lamb Weston, and that does play a role in it.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question now from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","We haven't really discussed I don't think any points on your private label portfolio. It sounds like with the 4% to 6% expected inflation, there could still be a little bit of pricing on the branded side. But if we were to see commodities just drift a little bit more, which is what we've really been seeing in the past couple of days, would you expect pricing to then ease more quickly on the private label part of the portfolio versus the branded or not really?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Rob, this is Andr\u00e9. I wouldn't necessarily see that. I wouldn't see it that way at all.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Okay. And why is that?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Well, again, you have to look at the commodities that we -- or the commodities that are underlying the basket of whatever that product is. So if we're taking a look at, for instance, bars or now pita chips and things like that, I think we're going to have look at the underlying basket of commodities that support that business and determine where that's going. But I don't necessarily see us rolling back pricing in either of the branded or unbranded. Again we, as John articulated, we see inflation in our portfolio next year. We don't see deflation. So I don't see that as something that we're going to need to do.","Operator","And we have a follow-up now from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to follow up on the pension stuff, 2 questions. Isn't the 83% figure actually pretty low relative to the peer group? I mean, isn't the peer group in the kind of the 90% to 100% funding? And then the second question is again, on this -- the amortization exclusion. So, John, does the volatility -- you're now putting the volatility of the service cost and the returns and the amortization of those costs or gains or what have you, that's all going to be an extraordinary item that's kind of excluded in the fourth quarter every year as opposed to any kind of recognition of the expense of the pension from period to period?","John F. Gehring","Yes, let me take those in order, if I can. So first of all, the issue of relative pension funding levels, one thing I think that's very important to keep in mind is our pension liability is measured as of May 31, 2012. I don't have the interest rate curves in front of me, but I am confident that, that is an absolute historic low point for discount rates. So when I look at 83%, and where we sit today, my concern is probably as much about a risk of overfunding if rates rise too high and too fast than it is about underfunding. So we are -- we have measured our liability at the absolute lowest point in discount rates in history. So companies that are measuring their discount rates at any other time over the past 12 months are going to have higher funding levels. So that's why you have to understand that math to understand why I'm so confident. The other question you asked, and again, I'm going to refer you to the materials because there's a lot of moving pieces here. But let me be clear. Our pension expense going forward is going to fully account for the 3 elements of pension cost that I referred to in my opening remarks. The first of it is our service cost, every time an employee works a day or a year and earns a future benefit, the full cost of that service cost is in our pension expense. The second thing that is in our pension expense is the interest on the liability that we have accrued at any point in time. The third element that's in our pension expense is the income we get from the returns on our assets. So all of the elements that you would normally expect to be in pension expense are fully included. The only matter that is going to be captured at year end is when there is a significant mark-to-market gain or loss, and there is no guarantee that there's going to be one of those gains or losses every year. But to the extent there are those significant mark-to-market gains or losses, those will be what's captured at year end as a comparability item. And maybe just for a little bit of additional color, interest rates are now at essentially an all-time low. To the extent those interest rates rise in all likelihood next year, we would have no gain or loss because we wouldn't be over a threshold where we would have to recognize any gain or loss. So I apologize for the accounting lesson here. You're probably all eligible for some CPE credit now, but again, I'd ask you to take a hard look at the materials, and we'd be certainly happy to work with Chris to clean anything up.","Operator","And we have a follow-up question now from David Driscoll with Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Andr\u00e9, can you talk a little bit about the trade promotion plans for fiscal '13? And how much of a reduction in trade promotion is the source of the funding for the advertising and consumer promotion? Is it nearly all of it or how do we best think about it?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, I'd -- David, I'm not going to get into the particulars of our trade funding. But I think what's really relevant into the discussion is Gary's points that we as an organization have recognized that historically as a company, ConAgra relied too much on push drivers to drive our business. And I think it's appropriate that we rebalance that mix so that we also have a lot of pull behind our brands, which historically we've underinvested in. So I think that's the right way to look at it. I don't want to get into specifics of what's going to happen to our trade funding. I do know that, that is what we're doing. That's what the pricing and margin is going to provide us the ability to do. And I think that's really important for the health of our brands going forward. And I think we're making the right decisions across the board.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. David, I think Andr\u00e9 is right on target. And remember, when we talk about the trade spend, that's going to show up in improvement in our net sales line. The A&P dollars is a separate line item. So you're going to see improvement in our net pricing, and you're going to see us increase our marketing spend, our A&P dollars.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And have you had any of these discussions with your retail customers yet? And how was their reaction to the switch, so to speak, from trade to advertising and CP spending?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","So the answer, David, is we have talked the talks with many of the retailers, and we've talked to them about this. They understand it. What they really want us to do is to be investing behind our brands, behind the innovation. They are very complimentary of the innovation we are bringing to market in multiple categories. They want to see their traffic counts up. They want to see customers picking up products in the center of the store. So they're very supportive of the actions that we're taking.","Operator","And there are no further questions.

Our primary focus this fiscal year has been on the top-line and we are particularly pleased with our momentum on this front as underlying sales trends, notably consumption continue to strengthen across our domestic retail segments. ","The investments we are making behind our brands to drive enhanced saliency, distribution and consumer trial are having the intended impact. These investments were largely above the line this quarter and consistent with our strategy to partner with retailers to acquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands and new innovation.","The timing of these increased investments converged with greater than expected inflation in the quarter including higher transportation costs, as well as higher than expected reductions in retail customer inventories. ","Combined, these factors created near-term pressure on our gross margin despite the fact that we continue to price ahead of our categories. Our M&A activity continued this quarter. We were very disappointed in the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s decision on the proposed Wesson sale and we are continuing to review Wesson\u2019s role in the portfolio. But, we kept our M&A momentum nonetheless.","Our solid performance has enabled us to raise our full year adjusted EPS guidance range. As a reminder, the guidance we most recently provided at CAGNY already accounted for the impact of the tax law changes. Today\u2019s incremental increase is based on our underlying performance. ","Even without the aid of Tax Reform, we would still exceed the high-end of our original guidance range driven by a strong top-line. As you can imagine, this is very satisfying, particularly in a far more onerous inflationary environment than we planned for. ","At our inaugural Investor Day in the Fall of 2016, we committed to do three things; increase margins, improve top-line, and build a winning company. Strategically, our biggest priority this year has been strengthening top-line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate. After three quarters, we like what we see. Our focus on bending the trend on the top-line continues to gain traction. ","We expect to continue experiencing some variation in our results quarter-to-quarter, but over time, we also expect to grow. As you will recall from last quarter, our shipments exceeded consumption largely behind the hurricanes. Of our 230 basis point improvement in top-line growth in Q2, we estimated that approximately 220 basis points were related to the hurricanes. ","During our Q2 call, we shared that we expected a reversal of this dynamic in Q3 with consumption outpacing shipments, particularly in our higher margin Grocery and Snacks segment. That expectation played out. ","So taking a step back, combining Q2 and Q3 performance enables us to create a more normalized cohort that takes out the timing effect of the hurricanes and highlights the steady progress we are making to drive consumer takeaway. ","As you can see on Slide 9, we expect our strong top-line trends to continue in the fourth quarter. Our deliberate efforts to cut unprofitable SKUs and pullback on low-quality promotions are now largely behind us. In our largest segments, we\u2019ve done a significant amount of the heavy value over volume lifting and the results are clear. ","As our new innovations have hit the marketplace, our top-line has responded with consistent, steady improvement. So while it remains early days, we are happy with our growth momentum and we are excited about the future. Our categories continue to grow largely driven by our efforts. And you can see that we are growing share. ","And Slide 11 highlights that the quality of our revenue base continues to improve. Total points of distribution are coming back in a much higher quality fashion, base velocities have improved dramatically and base dollar sales are in positive territory again. ","As you can see on Slide 12, these trends have allowed us to continue to price above our categories. We\u2019ve also remained true to our value over volume strategy as the percent of products sold on promotion has decreased every quarter for more than two years. While that trend is not sustainable in perpetuity, this clearly indicates that our strong volume performance was not driven by deep discounts or price rollbacks. ","None of these results would be possible had we not set out to aggressively modernize our iconic brands. It\u2019s been heavy lifting, but it\u2019s also been tremendously rewarding and we are just getting warmed up with another robust innovation slate set to hit the market in fiscal 2019. ","As most of you know, we started our efforts to bend the top-line trend by focusing on Frozen, given the strong underlying fundamentals of the category and the untapped potential we identified in our brands. As you can see on Slide 14, our focus on innovation and targeted investments to drive brand saliency, distribution and consumer trial are clearly bearing fruit. ","We\u2019ve experienced continued growth in Refrigerated and Frozen driven primarily by core business improvements and innovation launches in the Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender's businesses. Frozen retail sales have improved materially. Frozen consumption was up nicely again in the quarter continuing a strong trend in the domain. ","And we think we have a lot of room to go from here as our distribution performance continues to improve and dollar sales growth has followed. Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender's are our three largest brands in Frozen and received the most significant focus of our renovation work. These brands play distinct roles in our portfolio and in the Frozen category. ","Banquet is the number one brand in Frozen single-served meals by volume, providing American Classics to more than 40 million households. Healthy Choice, competes very effectively and has had a makeover to focus on active lifestyle. And Marie Callender's is known for its comfort food. ","By focusing on and leveraging the unique characteristics and strengths of these brands, we\u2019ve returned each of them to growth and reestablished the relevancy of Frozen meals, and we see substantial runway for continued growth ahead. ","As we showcased last month at CAGNY, we are very excited about our fiscal 2019 Frozen innovation. We will extend into new day parts, expand modern wellness and new cuisine offerings, and pursue hand-held options. ","Sampling of these new innovations can be found here on Slide 18. Taking a step back, one of the things we are most determined about in Frozen is that given our strong performance we have ample room to capture our fair share of shelf space and grow organically. ","As highlighted in the chart on Slide 19, we have much larger share of dollar sales than we have of TPDs. We are working with retailers to highlight this fact as they review their planograms, we expect them to trim over skewed products those that are showing above 100 in this index and add more of the underskewed products like ours that have earned more space on the shelf.","We expect this to be a tailwind for our Frozen business going forward as we gain our fair share of distribution. Progress we\u2019ve made in Frozen demonstrates that our plan is working and we are not resting on what we\u2019ve accomplished to-date. ","Turning to our Grocery and Snacks segment on Slide 20, as we noted earlier, we expected this segment\u2019s sales to be down in Q3, given the impact of the hurricanes in Q2. Recall, we saw sales exceed consumption in the second quarter. ","However, in Q3, sales were down more than expected, primarily related to an unanticipated reduction in retail customer inventory levels near the end of the calendar year. While this adjustment in inventory levels negatively impacted the quarter, we expect this shift in customer behavior to be a one-time transitory occurrence. ","Despite the unexpected impact of the reduction in retail customer inventory levels in Q3, when you look at the normalized cohort of Q2 and Q3 combined, which removes the impact of these timing dynamics, we remain on track. ","The improvement in the segment is encouraging and we have concrete plans in place to renovate certain brands and provide the appropriate investment support behind them similar to the work we\u2019ve done in our Frozen portfolio.","Although it\u2019s certainly early days, we are pleased with the underlying consumption trends in our Grocery and Snacks portfolio, which bodes well for this segment\u2019s long-term top-line growth prospects. When you look just at our base business in Grocery and Snacks, trends are even more encouraging. Non-promoted consumption exceeded our internal expectations in the quarter and we\u2019ve seen solid share performance as well. ","As you can see in the chart on the right, base dollar sales turned positive in the quarter for the first time in more than two years, a promising sign of what\u2019s to come. A particular note, we are seeing growth from both iconic established brands like Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's and Swiss Miss, as well as newly acquired brands like Angie's BOOMCHICKAPOP, Duke's and Bigs. ","Again, these are encouraging signs and reflect the impact we can have as bring the right approach to brand building and innovation across our portfolio. We expect to accelerate from here with a particular focus on snacking. We are energizing our snacking playbook with ramped up innovation, a focus on driving impulse consumption, marketing with a purpose and better price pack architecture. ","We are creating a culture within a culture to fit the unique attributes of the Snacks business which has different products and purchasing behavior. And as I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not just what we do with our snack brands, it\u2019s how we do it. We need to be faster, introducing new varieties across the portfolio like the exciting new innovation you see on Slide 25, which will hit the market in fiscal 2019. ","While we are excited about the opportunity in Snacks, we remain focused on our Grocery brands. Slide 25 also shows some of our upcoming innovation and renovation in the Grocery business where we see growth opportunities in condiments and enhancers, and are working to keep our lucrative shelf-stable meals inside the business reliably contributing. ","We are renovating these brands with modern flavors, simplified ingredients, and new graphics to better appeal to today\u2019s consumers. Similar to what we\u2019ve done in our Frozen business, as we innovate, we expect to see benefits from improving sales mix, through premiumized products and more relevant brands. ","With all of our strong innovation hitting the market, we\u2019ve made the strategic decision to add incremental support behind our brands to enhance saliency, distribution and consumer trial. We recognize that today\u2019s world requires a different approach to marketing. ","We are focused on making investments that engage the consumer with our brands and that could include traditional TV and print ads, distribution investments, merchandizing, sampling, digital marketing and even customer loyalty programs.","As you can see on Slide 26, we are focused on reaching the consumer where they are on their path to purchase including by leveraging targeted digital engagements and incentives prior to their arrival in the store. ","On Slide 27, you can see a sample of some of the brand investments we are making with our retail partners. Some of our marketing investments may appear above the net sales line and some of it may be below. But the overall goal is to add incremental support, especially where we have new renovation and innovation. ","These investments will be brand and customer-specific, as we acquaint consumers with our modernized portfolio and new innovation. And based on our strong consumer trends, these efforts are clearly paying off. As I noted at the outset, the timing of these investments converged with higher than anticipated inflation. ","As highlighted on Slide 28, inflation is trending well above the 2.7% we anticipated as part of our initial fiscal 2018 guidance. The inflation impacts both input costs and transportation costs, which have risen sharply across the industry. The net result in Q3 was that despite our actions to price ahead of our categories, gross margins were pressured. ","As we\u2019ve said before, margins may move around quarter-to-quarter beyond our normal seasonality and as we continue through our transformation, we will look to exit lower margin businesses and enhance our portfolio with margin-accretive innovation and acquisitions quarter-to-quarter. We\u2019ll also invest where we believe we can achieve a high ROI and of course, we\u2019ll see fluctuations in input costs. ","However, we are confident that regardless of short-term impacts, we will continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time as we have for the past several years. We are proud of the 430 basis points of margin expansion we achieved from fiscal 2015 to 2017 and we are not done. ","While there were a few transitory factors impacting our gross margin performance in Q3, overall, our operating margin remains strong and our fiscal 2018 guidance shows that we continue to see operating margin expansion.","Dave will provide a bit more detail on the specific factors that impacted near-term margin performance, but the bottom-line is that none of these factors change our long-term margin outlook or our commitment to chip away at the margin opportunity over time. ","Turning to Slide 31, M&A remains a central part of our plan. We intend to pursue modernizing acquisitions, synergistic acquisitions and select divestitures. We\u2019ll continue to strike the right balance between being aggressive and being disciplined. ","In the third quarter, we completed our acquisition of Sandwich Bros and announced plans to divest our Canadian Del Monte fruit and vegetable business. We also announced the termination of our agreement to sell the Wesson oil business. As I mentioned earlier, we intend to continue to evaluate the role of this business within our portfolio. ","In summary, we are pleased with our continued progress on the top-line and encouraged by the performance of our innovation. We intend to continue supporting growth through disciplined and strategic investments to drive brand saliency, distribution and trial while we manage through a near-term inflationary environment. ","And we continue to be supported by a strong balance sheet with the financial flexibility to pursue M&A opportunities to enhance our portfolio. Given our solid performance, we\u2019ve updated our fiscal 2018 guidance to raise adjusted EPS above the previously provided range which already accounted for the impact of tax reform. ","With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Dave to share more on the financial details of the quarter. ","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone. Slide 34, outlines our financial performance for the third quarter versus the prior year. I\u2019ll walk through our results at the total company and segment levels and you are going to hear some themes. ","First, our investments to drive the top-line are working. While the third quarter organic net sales were negatively impacted by hurricane-related timing shifts between the second and third quarters, as well as some unexpected customer inventory contractions in the third quarter, we see continued net sales progress. Our value over volume strategy and product innovation are working. ","Second, gross profit was impacted by several factors this quarter including our intentional choices on how to invest in the top-line. We continued to focus our brand building activity on above the line marketing investments with retailers and we reduced A&P investments. This impacted gross margin. We also saw challenges on the cost side. ","Our core productivity programs continue to deliver. But their benefits were more than offset by significant input cost inflation in the quarter including transportation. Since we don\u2019t provide gross margin results at the segment level, you\u2019ll see this flow through to operating margin in the segment performance. ","Also, the Grocery and Snacks segment experienced some transitory operating costs that impacted operating profit and margin. While the quarter presented a variety of dynamics to work through the teams stayed focused on fundamentals and as you can see, we\u2019ve reconfirmed our net sales guidance and increased our EPS outlook for the year. ","So let\u2019s dig into the details. Reported net sales for the third quarter were up 0.7% while organic net sales were down 2.2% reflecting timing shifts in sales between the second and third quarters and overall customer inventories contracting more than anticipated around calendar year end. ","As Sean mentioned, total organic net sales for the second and third quarter combined, grew 0.1% showing continued positive momentum. ","Adjusted gross profit dollars were down $27 million or 4.3%. Adjusted gross margin was 30% for the third quarter, in line with the second quarter and down approximately 155 basis points from the prior year. ","A&P expense decreased 13.7% or $12 million. As seen in the second quarter, the decline in A&P was more than offset by increased above the line marketing investment with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution and consumer trial in-store. These retailer investments helped deliver strong consumption growth in the quarter. ","Adjusted SG&A was relatively flat to the prior year and was 10% of net sales, slightly favorable to the year ago quarter as we continue to run a lean organization. We like that our adjusted SG&A spend as a percentage of net sales remains top tier in the industry. ","Adjusted operating profit was down $12 million or 3.6% for the quarter. This was due to inflation of 3.7% driven primarily from input costs and transportation, along with the retailer investments mentioned earlier. Although gross productivity was strong for the quarter, realized productivity was suppressed by higher than normal transitory operating costs. ","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61 for the third quarter, which was up 27.1% driven primarily by lower tax rates. ","Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our third quarter net sales change versus a year ago. Total company organic net sales were down 2.2%. Volume decreased 2.8%, driven mostly by the shift in timing of sales between the second and third quarters, as well as a higher than expected reduction in retailer inventories near the calendar year end, particularly in the Grocery and Snacks segment.","Overall price mix increased primarily from favorable products and customer sales mix in Foodservice, along with positive pricing in the International segment, and favorable price mix in the Refrigerated and Frozen segment from new products. This was partially offset by continued increases in above the line marketing investments. ","The acquisitions of the Duke\u2019s and Bigs brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 and Angie\u2019s and Sandwich Bros in fiscal year 2018 added 240 basis points to third quarter net sales growth. The impact of favorable FX also contributed 50 basis points of reported net sales growth. ","Slide 36 outlines the adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin declines in the third quarter. Inflation in ingredients, packaging and transportation were the major drivers of gross margin decline. Inflation of 3.7% in the quarter drove approximately $50 million of gross profit decline, negatively impacting gross margin by 2.5 percentage points. ","Transportation represented approximately 25% of total inflation for the quarter. Above the line marketing investments with retailers to drive enhanced distribution and consumer trial represented eight-tenths of a percentage point of the gross margin decline. ","Favorable price mix and strong gross productivity mitigated some of the gross margin decline, but realized productivity was suppressed due to transitory costs in our Grocery and Snacks business, which I will discuss shortly. ","Moving to adjusted operating margin, the 1.6 percentage point decline in gross margin drove operating margins down for the quarter. This was partially offset by SG&A and A&P favorability as we continued to manage SG&A tightly, and shift A&P investment to above the line marketing investment with retailers. ","We expect A&P to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as we continue to evaluate the balance between below and above the line marketing opportunities. ","Slide 37 highlights our results by reporting segment. In our Grocery and Snacks segment, reported net sales of $838 million were down 1.3%. Acquisitions added 500 basis points of growth in the quarter, organic net sales were down 6.3%. Consumption trends continued to improve in the quarter. ","However, organic volume declined 4% as we shipped below consumption in the third quarter after shipping above consumption in the second quarter. Volume was also impacted by higher than expected retailer inventory reductions and deliberate actions to optimize distribution on certain low margin items. ","Additionally, price mix declined approximately 2% as we increased above the line marketing investments with retailers. This investment is paying dividends as overall Grocery and Snacks consumption has improved driven by base velocity improvements as Sean discussed. ","Adjusted operating profit of $178 million decreased 16% or $34 million with adjusted operating margins down approximately 370 basis points versus the prior year. The segment\u2019s operating margin compression was driven by four discrete items including some network transitory in nature. ","First, input costs and transportation inflation were the largest headwinds on operating profit and margins in the quarter representing $15 million of operating profit decline. Second, we increased above the line marketing investments with retailers to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution and consumer trial of key brands. ","Consumption improved in both the second and third quarter supported by these investments. Third, despite strong gross productivity cost savings in supply chain, realized productivity in the quarter was reduced by certain transitory operational offsets. ","For example, we had unexpected plant maintenance and production downtime, higher than normal inventory write-downs on certain discontinued and slow moving items, and unfavorable overhead absorption given the volume declines in the quarter. ","Lastly, while the recent growth-focused acquisitions aided the segment\u2019s operating profit growth rate, they also reduced the operating margin percentage. This is because these businesses have maintained strong A&P investments as well as elevated SG&A levels as they integrate into the company. ","In our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, reported net sales grew to $689 million, a 3.2% increase. Organic net sales grew 2.6% as the acquisition of Sandwich Bros added 60 basis points of growth. Volume increased 2% due to core business improvements and innovation launches in the Banquet, Healthy Choice, and Marie Callender's businesses. ","Price mix increased 1% as mix improvements from recent innovation more than offset retailer investments to drive enhanced distribution and consumer trial. Adjusted operating profit of $127 million decreased 0.6% in the quarter. The benefits of net sales growth and realized productivity improvements were more than offset by increased input cost for proteins, packaging and higher transportation cost. ","In our International segment, reported net sales were approximately $223 million for the quarter, up 8.9% versus the prior year. This reflects approximately 1% growth in volume and nearly 3% improvement in price mix as the International team continued to focus on value over volume. FX favorably impacted net sales in the third quarter by roughly 5%. ","International adjusted operating profit was $30 million, up 67% or $12 million versus the prior year driven primarily by increased pricing and lower A&P spending. In our Foodservice segment, net sales were approximately $244 million for the quarter, down 6% versus the prior year. We also continued to implement our value over volume strategy in Foodservice.","Volume decreased approximately 13% in the quarter as the Foodservice team exited non-core and low-performing businesses. Price mix increased 7% driven by favorable product and customer mix as well as pricing. ","Foodservice adjusted operating profit was $24 million, down 13.4% versus the prior year with operating margins decreasing 85 basis points. Favorable price mix was more than offset by the impact of volume declines and increased material and transportation cost. ","Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million for the quarter, down 27.4% reflecting a decrease in certain IT projects and incentive costs, slightly offset by a reduction in income from two terminated transition service agreements. ","Moving to slide 38, this chart outlines the drivers of the 27.1% adjusted diluted EPS improvement in the third quarter versus a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars decreased $27 million in the third quarter, driving $0.04 of the EPS decline. Lower SG&A and A&P expense added $0.02 of the EPS improvement with some of the A&P investment moving above the line as discussed. ","Favorable interest expense and an increase in Ardent Mills joint venture income added $0.01 of EPS improvement. EPS was favorably impacted by $0.09 as the adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19.7% versus 31.4% a year ago. ","The lower tax rate in the third quarter reflects the favorable impact of tax reform. Our estimated full year adjusted tax rate is 29% to 30%. Share repurchases added $0.04 of EPS improvement as we continued our repurchase activity in line with our outlook. ","Slide 39 summarizes selected balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Net cash flow from operating activities was $808 million for the year-to-date period, up from $804 million for the same period a year ago. We had capital expenditures of $176 million through the year-to-date period, up from $159 million in the comparable year period. ","We repurchased approximately 8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $280 million in the third quarter. Total year-to-date share repurchases were $860 million. We ended the third quarter with net debt of approximately $3.5 billion, up from $2.7 billion at fiscal year-end 2017. This increase supported our share repurchases and acquisitions. ","As we have stated previously, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating for the business. As shown on Slide 40, we made a voluntary $300 million pension contribution on the first day of the fourth quarter. It was funded with a one year term loan at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. ","Given the timing of this contribution, we deducted this payment on our fiscal 2017 tax return at the old rate reducing cash taxes by approximately $105 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. ","Please note that this does not impact our adjusted book tax rate that runs through the P&L. The rating agencies view underfunded pensions largely as debt. We share this view since the net obligation is recorded as a liability on our balance sheet. By funding this contribution with debt, the transaction is effectively debt neutral. ","This contribution will reduce our variable PBGC premium paid by the Pension Plan Trust, which is calculated based on the plan\u2019s underfunded status. Currently, the PBGC charges pension plans a variable expense of just over 3% on underfunded pension obligations. ","Moving our pension plan towards fully funded status allows us to reduce future volatility as we can now better match our asset returns with the liability payments. We will give more color on the P&L impact of these actions when we share our fiscal 2019 guidance next quarter. ","At that time, we will also provide additional information on the impact of the change in accounting that requires all pension costs and benefits other than service cost to be presented outside of operating profit.","Slide 41 outlines our updated guidance for fiscal year 2018 and reflects a few changes since our CAGNY presentation. We expect organic net sales growth to remain near the high end of our range which was previously communicated at minus 2% to flat. ","Reported net sales growth is expected to be 150 basis points higher than the organic net sales growth rate due to acquisitions and FX. This has been updated from our previously communicated range of 100 to 150 basis points higher. We expect adjusted operating margin to be near the low end of our range of 15.9% to 16.3%. ","We continue to expect inflation to be 3.7% for the full year, but it is expected to moderate in the fourth quarter as we start lapping the input cost inflation we experienced in the fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to expect our full year fiscal 2018 adjusted tax rate to be in the 29% to 30% range reflecting the lower federal tax rate. ","In addition to our pension investment that I just discussed, we continued to review investment opportunities associated with our estimated reduction in cash taxes in line with our balanced capital allocation approach and we\u2019ll provide more details when we provide fiscal 2019 guidance in our fourth quarter earnings release. ","We expect adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $2.03 to $2.05 up from the range of $1.95 to $2.02 provided at CAGNY. We remain on track to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2018 subject to market and other conditions including the absence of any synergistic acquisitions. ","Regarding steel and aluminum tariff, we expect no impact to fiscal 2018 given our inventory position. We are still evaluating the estimated impact to fiscal 2019 and are working through our mitigation plans up and down the value chain. Our trade group and other advocacy partners are also working on options. ","In summary, ConAgra Brands is making strong progress. We continue to see consumption trends momentum and have made great progress upgrading our volume base. We are investing in our businesses despite increased inflation in transitory costs. We\u2019ve made several modernizing acquisitions over the last year, and our balance sheet remains strong, giving us flexibility to pursue additional acquisitions to drive shareowner value. ","We are reconfirming our full year organic net sales guidance near the high-end of the range and have raised our adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal year 2018. ","Thank you. This concludes my remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Marberger. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Andrew Lazar ","Good morning everybody. ","Sean Connolly","Good morning, Andrew.","Dave Marberger","Good morning. ","Andrew Lazar ","I guess my question is, given the broader industry trends we\u2019ve seen on things like inventory destocking and the shift of dollars from SG&A to above the line as you\u2019ve talked about, how confident are you that the expected retail consumption is acceleration in fiscal 4Q, I guess, can fully materialize into your reported sales, right, because you are looking for a pretty big step-up or for, I guess, for consumption to better match your reported sales in the fourth quarter.","Sean Connolly","Yes, Andrew, Sean here. I am very confident in that. The inventory destocking piece, there are two aspects to that. First of all, that we got to kind of separate. One is the hurricane which caused us to ship ahead of consumption in Q2 and reverse in Q3. The second was more of the unexpected decline in a handful of customer inventories near the end of the calendar year. ","I have seen that pattern before in my career numerous times. It tends to happen near the end of major customers\u2019 fiscal years. In previous experience, it tends to almost always be transitory. So, I have no reason to believe that we are not going to see shipments and consumption converge. And then when you couple that with the fact that we\u2019ve got very strong innovations in the marketplace today, our baseline velocities continue to improve and our total points of distribution continue to improve and the fact that we don\u2019t have that much left to go in the balance of the fiscal year, we are very confident and really encouraged by the top-line expectations we have for the fourth quarter. ","Operator","The next question will come from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Spillane ","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Sean Connolly","Hi, Bryan, good morning.","Bryan Spillane ","I guess, I had a \u2013 just maybe a more philosophical question. As you are kind of looking out beyond 2018, this year you\u2019ve had good success investing to drive the top-line and you\u2019ve been able to sort of protect your margins. ","I guess, if you look at next year with tax reform maybe share repurchases, would you sort of look to continue to drive that spend to drive that top-line growth even if it might moderate operating profit growth given all the inflation and given that you\u2019ve got some tailwinds below the line or would you think differently about that going into next year?","Dave Marberger","Okay, let me try to tackle that. I\u2019m not going to get into any guidance-related stuff for next year at this point. But I think where you are getting at is, do I anticipate some kind of a material step-up in absolute total marketing spend going forward. Look, here is how I think about that. When it comes to total marketing spend at our company, we have \u2013 and we\u2019ve talked about this repeatedly, a very strong ROI mindset, in fact, over the last few years, our marketing analytics around trade and A&P have improved dramatically. ","And that has enabled us on average to cut non-working dollars in both trade and A&P and redeploy them to better programs, be they above the line or below the line. It\u2019s also enabled us on average to avoid the dreaded A&P rebase while we execute our transformation plan. So going forward, I think we are going to continue to find pockets of inefficiency in existing spend. ","And therefore, when the time comes to support incremental innovation in Snacks as an example, it won\u2019t necessarily require incremental spend. Obviously, that may not be true in every single quarter, because we may have more spend in periods where we are in launch mode as I describe it. ","But I\u2019d like to think that overall, our spend is in the ballpark, I think in general, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of that if you look at a significant body of time there may be variance in the quarter, but I think our overall spend is in the ballpark over a sustained period of time. ","Operator","The next question will be from David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead. ","David Driscoll ","Great, thank you and good morning. ","Sean Connolly","Good morning. ","David Driscoll ","My question is on the gross margins and retail pressures, so Sean, gross margins were down meaningfully in the quarter. There are certainly some management actions that are deliberate, but most of the pressure appears to be inflation-related. So, just two points here. First, how do you see gross margins going forward? ","Are you satisfied with this performance given the environment you are in? And then, separately, I would really appreciate it if you could give us some of your color to describe the retail environment and the ability of the ConAgra portfolio to achieve price realization in an inflationary environment?","Sean Connolly","Sure. Real quick upfront, David. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of these transitory factors we are dealing with right now, we don\u2019t expect them to have an impact on our longer-term margin outlook. But obviously, kind of the topic of the moment right now in our industry is inflation, productivity, pricing. So, let me tell you how I think about those things, big picture. ","I\u2019ll start with inflation. Obviously, inflation happens, it is a fact of life and we view it as our job to navigate it as effectively as we possibly can to protect our margins. Productivity and pricing are two critical levers and we\u2019ve got strong capabilities around each of those levers. ","That doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be short-term volatility, particularly when you are in a window where commodity inflation pivots from being benign to being acute as well as being in a window where you\u2019re simultaneously investing to drive consumer trial of a very strong innovation slate. On productivity, the way I think about it is our team continues to do an excellent job executing on their projects in delivering strong gross productivity. ","As Dave pointed out though, there were some transitory offsets that suppressed what we call realized productivity in this quarter, but those won\u2019t be reoccurring. Then when it comes to pricing, as you\u2019ve seen over the past few years, we\u2019ve been quite focused on liberating our brands from ultralow, legacy price points where our brands were stuck for decades. ","But principally, we think about pricing three ways. First, inflation-justified pricing, second, trade efficiency, and third, premium priced innovation which has been significant for our company as you saw in the CAGNY presentation. All three of these pricing tools have and all three will continue to play a role. And pricing isn\u2019t easy. ","Frankly it never has been. I wouldn\u2019t have all these white hairs if it was, but, it\u2019s tough and it\u2019s often complex. But as I think most of you know, we are partnering very, very closely with our customers these days and our customers are quite happy with the innovation programs that they are getting from ConAgra Brands and they understand that the fuel for those innovations comes from our margins.","Now obviously, not every brand and every category is created equal, which is why we think about revenue management and integrated margin management broadly. But overall, I am confident that we will continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time and then, simultaneously reduce the standard deviation around that centerline over time. ","Operator","The next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Akshay Jagdale ","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Sean, I wanted to ask you about the sales growth acceleration. Isn\u2019t that a leading indicator of the strength of your brand and the portfolio and longer-term, sort of the gross profit pool expansion, right. ","So, in other words, the sales growth acceleration that we are seeing from you and a lot of other peers in the industry shouldn\u2019t that bode well for profit pool sort of growth over time and this cost increase is transitory. So, over time though, doesn\u2019t the sales growth actually tell us that you should feel better about passing on these transitory costs? Thanks. ","Sean Connolly","Well, obviously, Akshay, we believe in strong brands, because strong brands tend to equate with lower elasticities of demand, lower elasticities of demand tends to equate with greater ability to price for the desired impact. But I think it\u2019s important to point out that brand strength is not a right, it has to be earned and there have been a lot of legacy brands in our industry that have weakened over time because they were neglected over time. ","We have worked incredibly hard to infuse modern attributes into our brands, so that we can reacquaint consumers with our brand and re-earn their respect and re-earn the credibility of those brands and we are doing it in a way that translating to higher price realization and over time will translate to higher margins. And it\u2019s been our value over volume strategy where we pull the lot of the weak stuff out of the base. ","We\u2019ve backed off on promotions and we\u2019ve strengthened the fundamentals. So now, going forward, as we talked at CAGNY, when you think about the runway, we see in Frozen and then you think about at applying this playbook to other parts of the portfolio, yes, we believe it should translate to ongoing strength or long-term outlook calls for that. And that\u2019s where we are going to stay focused on. ","Operator","The next question will be from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe ","Hi, good morning. ","Sean Connolly","Hi. ","Chris Growe ","Just had \u2013 hi, just had a question around the cost inflation and productivity savings by division and not to get so exact, but if you think about what\u2019s kind of your cost inflation versus productivity savings in Frozen versus Grocery and Snacks, are either one of those divisions better positioned around either one of those factors and maybe could require less pricing going forward, if you\u2019ve got more offset \u2013 more kind of net productivity savings coming through? Thank you.","Dave Marberger","Yes, Chris, this is Dave. Let me \u2013 it\u2019s a good question. There is a lot to this. So let me just start from the topic you look at gross margin, right, we are down 160 basis points, inflation was 250 basis points with a headwind and we also made the conscious decision to invest in above the line marketing with retailers which was 80 basis points. ","So, clearly, they were headwinds due to gross margin. From a productivity perspective, the gross productivity which in the first half was about 3.1% of cost of goods sold came in at that same level for the third quarter. So, when you convert that to a gross margin impact, that\u2019s about 2% a little bit above. So, we are seeing that. ","The other thing that hit us were and I talked about some operational offset, some were transitory, some were not. I talked about ones that were transitory in terms of inventory write-offs and dynamics around that and in some plant maintenance and production dynamics. So, that was about 50 basis points in terms of what was transitory in the quarter for total company. ","When you kind of peel it out by segment, if you look at Frozen, the inflation for Refrigerated and Frozen and the inflation for Grocery and Snacks is about the same. It\u2019s actually a little bit higher. Right now in Refrigerated and Frozen just because of the amount of proteins and the inflation that we\u2019ve seen there. But we will start wrapping on that in the fourth quarter. ","So that won\u2019t be as big of an impact. Transportation and freight, obviously affects us across our entire portfolio. And then from a productivity perspective, we are pretty balanced there. Maybe a little bit more in our Refrigerated and Frozen versus our Grocery and Snacks. So, our productivity is probably a little bit lower in Grocery and Snacks. ","That combined with the \u2013 these operational offsets that I talked about, that\u2019s what had the bigger impact on operating profit in Grocery and Snacks for this particular quarter. So, that\u2019s basically, in terms of inflation, we also have it in Foodservice, International as well. But there is the dynamic as you look at total and then you break it down by segment. ","Operator","The next question will be from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson ","Thank you. So, in terms of this Grocery and Snacks division, on the price mix side, I know, obviously there \u2013 it seems like there, few more incremental investments that are now on marketing of other line, or within COGS relative to SG&A, but I am just trying to get a better sense of price mix in Q3 and what we saw, I know, I guess, you kind of point to this investments in brand saliency, et cetera. ","But, like, was there some additional promotional spend to push some of the innovation to get the distribution or I am just trying to get a sense as to why price mix would have decelerated sequentially, and then also why it should accelerate going forward? Thanks. ","Dave Marberger","Let me take a shot at that, Rob. So, in terms of Grocery and Snacks, we talked about \u2013 we had a significant investment in above the line marketing with retailers. So I talked about 80 basis points for total company. More than half of that was in Grocery and Snacks. So, we are making those investments. There was some price mix benefit there, but that was more than offset by the additional investments we made with retailers. ","And these are \u2013 this is just not price discounting these investments that we are making. These are investments to improve merchandizing. Sean talked about it in his piece. So, we have significant investments in Grocery and Snacks. We also have the above the line marketing investments in Refrigerated and Frozen. ","But with our innovation now that that you\u2019ve seen, we are starting to benefit from that component of pricing that Sean talked about which is based on innovation and margin-accretive innovation and the benefits that has on the price mix line. ","So, that\u2019s why when you look at Refrigerated and Frozen, we are actually one percentage point favorable price mix because the benefits we are getting from the innovation are more than offsetting the investments we are making with retailers. So, making investments in both segments a little bit higher in Grocery and Snacks and we are not seeing as much of the innovation yet in Grocery and Snacks, but that will be more to come next year. Sean?","Sean Connolly","Rob, if I could just add one thing to that too. The other question is, what\u2019s the impact to these investments above the line and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the impact has been very positive. Keep in mind, Grocery and Snacks is a space where we haven\u2019t done a fraction of the material innovation yet that we\u2019ve done in Frozen. ","So we\u2019ve been making these investments to basically get a lot of our preexisting items back in front of consumers and get our consumers to retry them. And as you saw in the presentation today, our consumption has been quite strong and as importantly the non-promoted piece of that has actually been above what we expected. ","So, it\u2019s working and I think that that suggests that we\u2019ve got a solid foundation here to build off of as we move more of our innovation emphasis into this other reporting segment .","Operator","The next question will come from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger ","Good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to get a better sense of how you are thinking about the freight cost outlook going forward and I guess, more specifically, does your inflation outlook take into account the potential for those costs to move higher again over the next quarter or two, which seems to be what we are hearing from some of the freight providers or do you see things as having reached more of a new normal? And then, follow-on, just proactively, what steps are you taking or can you take going forward in the supply chain to help mitigate that?","Dave Marberger","Matt, so, let me take a shot at that. So, yes, from the top, our inflation outlook of 3.7% for the year which hasn\u2019t changed with this quarter incorporates our estimate of inflation for freight and transportation. So that\u2019s in there. That\u2019s in our fourth quarter estimate at this point in time. As you look at this more broadly, we have a really seasoned team here in our supply chain organization that manages transportation and freight and it\u2019s an area that we look at every day. ","At the highest level, this comes down the basic supply and demand, right. If there is more demand to carry loads and there are drivers to carry that. So this creates a challenge. It really relies on our relationships with our carriers and our contracts that we have with them. So, when demand spike, we have to go into the spot market like other companies. ","And we are hiring spot markets than historical, but our overall spot market levels are lower than peers given our approach and the way that we manage this. When you look at our total freight and transportation and warehousing costs, they are roughly 10% of total cost of goods sold. But they are obviously increasing at a higher rate. ","So, as I mentioned in my remarks, 25% of our total inflation came from transportation and freight. So, we are proactively evaluating and adjusting our approach to minimize cost increases going forward and we view the cost increase just like all other input cost increases, when we look at overall inflation that we must try to offset with any pricing. ","Operator","The next question will be from Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman ","Just to follow-up on that. Dave, I\u2019d like to understand a little bit better how, in your opinion, you\u2019ve been in the food group for a while now. How most agreements with trucking vendors work in this industry? Because, we\u2019ve heard lately from a different, one of your peers that they were surprised by higher transportation costs and it sounds like part of the issue was that, maybe certain agreements with vendors were locked in for rates. ","But not miles, so that vendors were able to effectively opt that on these arrangements when rates rose. I guess, I am just trying to get your opinion on the group in general, is this a typical set up where vendors have this flexibility or is it somewhat unusual? Again, just trying to sort of better understand some of the risks for the group and I know you\u2019ve seen a couple of different perspectives here.","Dave Marberger","Well, again, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ve been around a long time. But I am not a expert in freight transportation. But, I\u2019ll kind of tell you what I see. The dynamics are interesting around the freight, because you can have different philosophies. You can have fewer carriers and try to leverage scale with those carriers or you can have more carriers and maybe that will \u2013 you won\u2019t get the scale benefits, but then in situations like this, you have more flexibility, because you have more competition basically and more options, right. ","So, you have to look at that. We tend to have a lot of carriers. So, that\u2019s kind of the way we manage it. We have a lot of strong relationships. So, there is a lot of dynamics like that that come into play, because supply and demand is challenged and when we need carriers can really vary, right, versus other companies. ","So, I can\u2019t sit here and do it just this. I can tell you that this is obviously something that we\u2019ve been focused on and we\u2019ve been watching and we talk about all the time and Sean is involved with those conversations. So, we have a great group here. We do everything. We are looking at different options to try to manage it. ","But, there is a lot of dynamics in here. It\u2019s not just one simple answer in it. You really have to kind of understand a little bit the philosophy that a company has around this area in managing the support for it. ","Operator","The next question will come from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow ","Hi, thanks for the question. I am going to carry on with the theme, maybe a little differently on freight. Everybody sees it and your customer see it too and my understanding is that you are probably in a negotiating season with your freight providers. So, isn\u2019t it logical to assume that if you and everyone else are going to experience higher freight costs through those negotiations and that maybe a 12 month timeframe. ","Couldn\u2019t you go to your customers and say, hey, this is widespread, everyone has a time for the consumer to pay for some of it. It seems like a logical argument and yet, I think you and others have been a little cautious about what kind of promises could be made in that regard. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Rob, it\u2019s Sean. If freight were the only thing we were dealing with, I think it\u2019s more logical that we would go have a direct conversation specifically about freight. But when you are dealing with inflation across a variety of different things, beyond freight, we\u2019ve got protein inflation, we got other things that are experiencing inflation. ","It really pivot the discussion more to, how do you holistically find different ways to pursue pricing in order to try to protect margins and it \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, it varies by brand and by category, but really, we\u2019ll try to bundle all of the things that are inflating in cost and let that total net delta inform the different strategies we might pursue to create offsets. ","So, that is that what you talked about which is a freight-specific conversation looking for offsets we\u2019ve contemplated that. Who knows, it may evolve going forward, but we are really looking at all of the inflation and looking at the three pricing levers as well as productivity as I mentioned before. ","Operator","The next question will be from Steven Strycula of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula ","Hi, and good morning. Sean, a quick question on the inventory destocking. What percentage of the portfolio would you say has already been touched by inventory destocking across major retailers? And are we running at what we would call minimum threshold of the inventory? Basically, can we see any more excess weeks of supply taking out or are we just really running on a just in time system? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Yes, Steve, I think it\u2019s closer to just in time. You\u2019ve heard other companies in the last month or so referenced this kind of unexpected inventory destocking at certain customers near the end of the calendar year. And during that window, at least from what we could see, it got extremely low, unusually low versus typically what we see. ","And we don\u2019t like to see that, because it typically means there is out of stocks on the shelf for consumers. So, I tend to think that doesn\u2019t ultimately benefit anybody, but, we\u2019ve seen that kind of move back to more normal levels. There aren\u2019t absolute lean inventory levels in the industry right now and across categories. ","That\u2019s been the case for a number of years, but it got really lean for a bit there, which is what we saw in Q3, but I think that\u2019s largely behind us. Obviously, we are always trying to anticipate if that\u2019s going to happen, but you never kind of know until you are in the thicker things. But I think we are tracking more just in time, more ship to consumption. At least, that\u2019s the way we forecast it. ","Operator","Thank you.

This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan and I will be your conference facilitator. All audience lines are currently in a listen-only mode. However, our speakers\u2019 will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the formal question-and-answer session.","At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning. Happy holidays and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m Gary Rodkin here with John Gehring our CFO and Chris Klinefelter VP of Investor Relations. Before we get started Chris has a few words.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements and while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our Company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which includes cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our Web site.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks Chris. Our second quarter comparable EPS was $0.61, about where we expected to be when we gave our guidance. Keep in mind last year\u2019s second quarter was our strongest for the last fiscal year. We saw good profit performances in both Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods this quarter. Our Private Brands segment performance is clearly not up to our expectations. We now expect recovery for this segment to take longer than originally planned and I\u2019ll say more about all of that in a minute.","Overall, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re strengthening the foundation of our Company. This year was designed to deliver stabilization and recovery and on balance, that\u2019s happening. The Consumer Foods brands with the biggest improvement opportunities are responding favorably. In our Commercial Foods segment, we\u2019re gaining new business domestically and across the Company, we\u2019re highly focused on a more efficient organization at all levels. We expect to meet our EPS commitment this fiscal year, despite the fact that Private Brands will be down for the year.","Now I\u2019ll offer more insight into each of our segments. Consumer Foods posted a 2% net sales decline, with volume and price mix both down one point, comparable profit increased 7%. We\u2019re executing according to our plan which calls for a better share improvement, growth in specific faster growing retail channels and stabilization of those few big important brands where we\u2019ve been struggling. We plan for fiscal \u201915 to be a year of foundation building and it is. We\u2019re making good progress particularly in light of the challenges everyone is experiencing in the marketplace. By focusing on where we can get growth, faster growing channels and retail fundamentals to be specific, we\u2019re directing our resources toward our best opportunities for wins.","In terms of domestic share gains one example is in frozen single-serve meals. Earlier this year, we achieved the number one dollar share position in frozen single-serve meals and we\u2019ve maintained it. Despite the challenges of the category, this is a large and profitable section of the store and very meaningful to retail customers. And we plan to leverage our critical mass and expertise to continue leading the category and help retailers grow. Marie Callender's continues to perform well with a long-term success story that just keeps getting better. We grew net sales, share and volume during Q2 in single-serve meals and took share in multi-serve meals.","I\u2019ll highlight a brand we haven't talked much about yet in frozen multi-serve. The P.F. Chang's Home Menu is an acquisition we made a couple of years ago. We renovated the product line this year, restaging it into the marketplace during Q2 with improved packaging and pricing strategy. The line now features all the components of a bundled complete meal including appetizers, entr\u00e9es and rice. We\u2019re seeing very strong early results.","Now I want to share results and what we\u2019ve called our fixed and grow brands, meaning Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice, Orville Redenbacher's. We\u2019re stabilizing these brands with a focus on what we call perfect at retail, meaning the basics, pricing, packaging, promotion and placement. Starting with Chef Boyardee, this brand is really turning around for us. It posted volume growth during the quarter, as well as dollar sales increases and share gains. Admittedly, that's on an easy comparison given our issues last fiscal year, but we feel good about the fundamental corrections we've made. Consumers have responded very positively to the return of the easy open lid and retail customers are supporting the brand with good in0store displays. This is a big brand with strong marketplace equity and residence and we\u2019re not letting up on the continuous improvement work here.","In regard to Healthy Choice, as you know from our past comments, we\u2019re emphasizing the Caf\u00e9 Steamers line at Healthy Choice because it continues to have significant growth potential. It's truly differentiated with proprietary tray-in-tray technology that makes for a great tasting product. As part of expanding this line, we shaped Healthy Choice simply Caf\u00e9 Steamers in Q2, which are made with nothing artificial and contain 100% natural white-meat chicken. Entr\u00e9es such as lemon herb chicken leverage of the steamy technique for a fresh and crisp taste, and while it's early for these entr\u00e9es, initial results are encouraging. We are now beginning to lap some of the assortment pruning we did last year on slower selling sub lines and as we continue to do that, we expect to see ongoing sequential improvement in Healthy Choice.","On Orville Redenbacher's, we\u2019re starting to see positive developments. We've simplified and streamlined flavor assortment and assume we\u2019ll have an on-shelf presence that\u2019s designed to have more impact. Packaging changes that improve retail visibility will go into market in January in-time for the Super Bowl. Changing the graphics might seem simple, but we\u2019re confident it will be meaningful and positive. When we made a similar change in ACT II Popcorn late last year, double-digit sales growth followed. We\u2019re also encouraged by early results for Orville Redenbacher's Skinnygirl varieties.","We have other areas of strength in the Consumer Foods portfolio involving sound margin management and strong consumer demand. For example Slim Jim, RoTel and Reddi-Wip, all grew volume in Q2 even while we took price to better reflect rising commodity input costs. Good execution on pricing plus strong acuities with good consumer demand built overtime are helping the Consumer Foods results.","Our intensified focus on Club, Dollar and Convenient stores continues to accelerate. As you know, these retail outlets are growing faster than traditional grocers and we\u2019re now taking share within these channels. We have a lot more opportunity here as we look forward. We\u2019re securing distribution for brands like Hunt's and Reddi-Wip in Club and Peter Pan in Dollar stores as we speak. We\u2019re aligning our innovation with the formats and offering these outlets need and that's an important part of our growth. Our ability to customize products, packaging and brands for these retailers is vital and we've had good success. This is a testament to what we can do when we\u2019re clear about our objectives. We harnessed our resources and focus.","Before I finish my remarks on Consumer Foods I\u2019ll will note that the comparable 7% operating profit growth showed that productivity and efficiencies are coming in strong. Inflation, which is significant on proteins, is manageable overall. We do expect to have FX headwinds to deal with, which means we\u2019ll need to continue to be as effective and efficient as possible. We continue to drive being perfect at retail, making sure every promotion dollar and advertising dollar works as hard as possible and with a good balance between the two. We\u2019re being more efficient with our investments and ensuring that they are truly value-add.","Now I\u2019ll turn my focus to the Private Brands segment. Profits were below a year ago amounts and a meaningful portion of that is due to the pricing concessions we made last year that we haven't yet lapped. We were expecting that part of the decline. But sales were weak during the quarter. Volume was down 6%, largely because our customers have put a lot of business out to bid and our competitors are responding aggressively. It is a clearly a fight for share going on in the food industry and in some categories, the battle includes branded players as well as Private Brands. We\u2019re experiencing some cost spikes in specific commodities which are impacting profitability in the short-term. Pricing initiative is underway, should help pass on the higher commodity costs overtime.","Regarding the rest of this fiscal year, we had originally expected modest profit growth in fiscal '15. Right after further evaluation we\u2019ve revised our outlook. This outlook better reflects the continuing competitive pressures, the impact of the commodity cost increases, the extended time needed to achieve the cost benefits from our network optimization and in general, the overall timeline we needed to make sustainable improvements in how we operate this segment. The Private Brands\u2019 segment profit will be down in fiscal '15. Results should significantly improve in fiscal '16, when we expect the business to recover and start growing. Improvement largely boils down to execution. This is the transformative undertaking to create scale in Private Brands and it\u2019s been more complex and required more time than we originally expected. We\u2019ve learned a lot, but there\u2019s still more fundamental work to do. While the environment is definitely very challenging, our issues are primarily our own execution and they are fixable. We clearly understand that we need to change how we operate this business, so that we consistently meet and exceed our customers\u2019 expectations and build stronger Private Brand partnerships. When that happens, we\u2019ll see improved and more consistent business performance in Private Brands.","Our turnaround plan is focused on several areas of our overall execution. First, we\u2019re working hard to increase our customer responsiveness and speed. Some of this is just the basics like getting packaging graphics done faster. Second, we\u2019re intent on improving our commercialization processes by eliminating bottlenecks and getting new products on shelf when the customer expects them. Third, we\u2019re establishing better service levels for customers, that includes things like fill rates, and on-time delivery realizing that each customer has different requirements and we need to meet those expectations. And fourth, we\u2019re building better connection between sales and the supply chain to optimize margin management. That will enable us to for example be more responsive to commodity moves.","To sum up those improvement areas, we need to become the true value-added partner that we know we are capable of being and we have to earn our right to be seen that way. We have deep convictions that we\u2019ll get there. When we do, that will mean less business put out to bid, more value-added innovation opportunities, better category management to drive velocities and much improved absorption in our plans, overall a much better top and bottom-line performance. This will take time, the work going on now isn\u2019t an immediate impact on our end-market performance, but we have a great deal of focus, energy and resources pointed squarely on improvement and we expect to start reaping the rewards of our efforts in fiscal '16. We remain committed to our long-term strategic vision for Private Brands. The marketplace tells us that the fundamental appeal of Private Brands to consumers is real and the strategic importance and profitability of Private Brands to our customers is real. And we know we can add value in a scaled way given our infrastructure. Realizing our vision will take more time, but we will make it happen.","Moving on to Commercial Foods. Sales were up 2% over year ago amounts and comparable operating profit increased 8% versus year ago. In our biggest business in this segment, Lamb Weston sales and profits were up this quarter. We\u2019ve added customers domestically and moved into a potato crop that is more efficient for processing, positively impacting our earnings delivery. We\u2019ve continued to diversify and strengthen our customer base, gaining share domestically and adding assets internationally, which bodes well for long-term growth. Some of our key international customers have faced slowdowns in their business due to a food safety issue from a meat supplier in Asia. But we view that as temporary, results for the other Commercial Foods businesses were in line with the year ago and they\u2019re poised to deliver solid performance in the back half of the year.","For those of you who may not have seen the announcement a few months back, we\u2019re now up and running with the Chinese potato processor we acquired during Q1, giving us the ability to serve our customers in this market with local production, which will play an important role in expanding our business in that market overtime. And before I leave the Commercial Foods segment, it\u2019s worth mentioning that the Longshoremen's labor situation on the West Coast is impacting international shipments. It\u2019s been mildly disruptive to-date and we hope it\u2019s resolved soon, but it could be more of an issue as the year progresses. We will keep you posted.","Outside of our segments many of you know we have some very good businesses classified within equity method investment earnings. For example Lamb Weston\/Meijer, a large joint venture between ConAgra Foods, Lamb Weston and Netherlands based Meijer Frozen Foods, recently announced plans to expand its frozen potato facility in Bergen Op Zoom, Netherlands to be complete in 2016. That\u2019s another vehicle to accelerate international growth. And our milling joint venture Ardent Mills which incorporates the former of ConAgra Mills business is off to a very strong start. This deal will be accretive to comparable EPS in a few years and is clearly a long-term strategic and financial win for us.","Before I close today, I want to just touch on our CEO search. Obviously I am firmly committed to leading ConAgra Foods until our new CEO is named. As I\u2019ve said before, my intent all along has been to retire in May at the end of fiscal '15 and I will be flexible depending upon the needs of the Company. I know our search committee is being extremely thorough and diligent in their selection of the next CEO to lead ConAgra Foods and we will share any news when there is some.","For now, I\u2019ll summarize our Company's progress so far this year like this. We said fiscal '15 would be a year of stabilization and recovery, and that's what is clearly happening in the Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods. Attributing to that is our overall effectiveness and efficiency work taking place throughout ConAgra Foods. We are on-track for the resulting SG&A savings, good productivity and good synergies. The near-term outlook for Private Brands has weakened. We\u2019re working on fundamental execution improvements to make us a better partner to our customers and to be seen as the value-added player we know we can be. We believe in material year-over-year growth in fiscal '16 as realistic and we expect margins to gradually improve overtime, and we have strong conviction about the long-term opportunity.","On balance, we\u2019re making good progress in many parts of our business, enough to offset weakness in our Private Brands segment which is why we\u2019re reaffirming guidance for fiscal 2015 EPS and our debt reduction goals you've heard before. I wish you and your families a great holiday and John will share additional details now. John?","John Gehring","Thank you, Gary and good morning and happy holidays to everyone. I am going to touch on four topics this morning. I\u2019ll start with some comments on our fiscal second quarter performance including our additional impairment charge this quarter. Next I will cover comparability matters, then on to cash flow capital and balance sheet items and finally I will provide some comments on our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.","Let's start with our performance, overall the fiscal second quarter comparable results were in line with our expectations and reflect good progress against several key focus areas, as well as continuing challenges in our Private Brands segment. We have reaffirmed our full year goals and continue to expect fiscal 2015 results to reflect stabilization and recovery.","Before I cover some of the details, I would remind everyone that with the formation of Ardent Mills joint venture in the fiscal first quarter, flour milling results prior to the formation of this JV are reflected as discontinued operations. Also our share of earnings from our 44% interest in Ardent Mills is included in equity method investment earnings.","With the fiscal second quarter, we reported net sales of $4.2 billion, about 2% below the year ago quarter. We reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.05 versus $0.48 in the year ago period. The sharp decline in reported EPS was driven by a non-cash impairment charge that I will say more about in a few minutes.","Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share were $0.61, slightly below comparable year ago amounts reflecting weaker performance in our Private Brands segment and expected dilution from the Arden Mills transaction, offset by stronger performance in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments and lower interest in corporate expenses.","Now I\u2019ll share a few comments on our segment performance. Starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $2 billion, down about 2% from the year ago period, reflecting 1% volume decline and 1% of negative price mix. As Gary noted, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we are making on key initiatives and the improvement in trends. Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $310 million or up about 7% from the year ago period. The operating profit reflects the improving volume trends and lower marketing and SG&A costs. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $8 million on net sales and about $6 million on operating profit for the segment this fiscal quarter.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results. This quarter, cost savings were approximately $45 million and largely offset inflation of about 4%. Inflation was slightly higher than our expectations driven by cost increases on certain input particularly proteins, as well as higher transportation costs. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $89 million, down about 19% from the prior year quarter, due impart to changes in timing and reallocation of funds from advertising to in-store promotion.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion or up about 2% from the prior year quarter driven by 2% volume improvement. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $148 million or 8% above the comparable year ago period. The operating profit increase principally reflects the volume growth and benefits from improved quality crop in Lamb Weston. Equity method investment earnings were higher this quarter due to the addition of earnings from the Ardent Mills joint venture.","Moving onto corporate expenses for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $92 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $58 million versus $64 million in the year ago quarter. Our Private Brands segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1.05 billion, down about 5% from the prior year quarter driven by a 6% volume decline resulting from category softness and pressures from both branded and private branded competitors. Operating profit excluding items impacting comparability was approximately $49 million down 46% from the prior year quarter. This decline reflects weak volume performance and margin compression driven by pricing concessions in the prior year fiscal year, as well as temporarily higher operating costs associated with supply chain initiatives.","The performance and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year also reflect additional margin pressures from rapid increases in several key commodity inputs particularly tree nuts and durum wheat. While overtime, we expect to recoup some of this lost margin through pricing. The pricing lag and related margin loss will not be recovered in the current fiscal year. Due to the short-fall in our profit and cash flow performance in our Private Brands segment and our updated expectations relative to the timing of improvement in cash flows in this segment, we have updated our goodwill impairment analysis. As a result, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $247 million or $222 million after-tax. This charge is principally related to the impairment of goodwill, but also includes some impairment charges related to certain brand or trademark assets in the Private Brands segment. The additional impairment is driven by the changed performance outlook and reflects the fact that the underlying discounted cash flow valuation models are very sensitive to changes in cash flow and other assumptions.","While we\u2019re disappointed with the setbacks in Private Brands this quarter, we are confident that we\u2019ll improve the margin structure of this business over the next several quarters, as we execute pricing for specific commodity increases, improve our execution especially related to customer service, pricing and margin management and complete supply chain initiatives which are driving higher one-time costs in the near-term. Based on our latest forecast, we expect operating margin to improve and to reach double-digit levels over the next several years.","Now I\u2019ll move onto my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.56 per diluted share of net expense in the quarter\u2019s reported EPS related to several items. As previously discussed, we recorded $247 million or $0.51 per share of non-cash charges related to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments in our Private Brands segment. On hedging for the fiscal second quarter, the net hedging loss included in corporate expenses was approximately $25 million or $0.04 per share. Next, we recorded approximately $21 million or $0.03 per share of net expense related to integration and restructuring costs. Also in the fiscal second quarter, we recognized a tax benefit of $8 million or approximately $0.02 per share related to the favorable adjustments of prior year federal income tax credits.","Next I\u2019ll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $122 million of cash on-hand and $536 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We continue to target operating cash flows of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2015, and we expect that this will provide us ample cash to achieve our fiscal 2015 debt repayment target. On the working capital for fiscal year 2015, we expect working capital changes to contribute modestly to operating cash flow. On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $90 million versus $171 million in the prior year quarter. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $550 million to $575 million, somewhat lower than our previous estimate.","Net interest expense was $75 million in the fiscal second quarter versus $95 million in the year ago quarter. Dividends for both this fiscal quarter and the year ago quarter were $106 million. On capital allocation as we have previously noted, our capital allocation priority through fiscal year 2015 will be the repayment of debt. By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to have repaid around $2 billion of debt since the Ralcorp acquisition, including $1 billion this fiscal year. We repaid about $500 million earlier this year from the Ardent Mills proceeds. We remain committed to a strong dividend and intend to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we de-lever. However, during this period we expect to limit our share repurchases. In this quarter, we repurchase only an immaterial amount of shares. And while we expect limited acquisition activity in the near-term as we repay debt, we will continue to evaluate investments to strengthen our performance.","As we enter fiscal 2016 with a stronger balance sheet, we expect to have more flexibility in our capital allocation to consider dividend increases, share repurchases and additional growth investments in addition to some debt repayment. As Gary noted last week, we announced plans to add production capacity to support growth in our Lamb Weston\/Meijer joint venture in Europe. This expansion will not require a capital contribution from the partners as it will be financed by the joint venture.","Now I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on our fiscal 2015 outlook. For fiscal 2015, we continue to expect diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability to grow at a rate in the mid single-digits from our fiscal 2014 comparable base of $2.17. Our current full year guidance reflects our view of several key performance factors, including the following; first, in our Consumer Foods segment, we continue to focus on fundamentals in-store, which are driving volume stabilization, and we expect a stronger year-over-year operating profit performance. And in our Commercial Foods segment we expect good sales and profit growth led by stronger performance in our Lamb Weston business. And while we believe the improved potato crop and volume growth will drive profit improvement in Lamb Weston, our international growth will be lower than plans due to near-term customer issues in Asia and impacts from the West Coast port -- labor dispute. We expect that our food service and other commercial businesses in this segment will post modest profit growth in fiscal 2015.","In our Private Brands segment, we now expect volumes and profits to be down year-over-year, reflecting competitive challenges and a longer timeline for improving our operating margins. We remain very focused on margin recovery in this segment, while our current results are being impacted by in-plant commodity increases, we have begun to take pricing in the effected categories, but the pricing lag will impact the current year. Also as we have previously noted, we are incurring temporarily higher operating cost this fiscal year related to certain supply chain initiatives, which will benefit future years. So we do expect to see good margin improvement over the next fiscal year. This fiscal year we also expect higher equity method investment earnings due to the contribution from Ardent Mills. As a reminder, while we are confident that overtime Arden Mills will be accretive to our earnings, there is about $0.08 of EPS dilution included in our fiscal 2015 outlook. Overall, equity method investment earnings in total are expected to be in excess of $100 million for the full fiscal year.","Overall, we have made good progress in both our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments through the first half of the year. As we have noted, we still have more work to do to improve the performance in our Private Brands segment. Our expectations for the full year remain on-track, despite headwinds from Private Brands, transportation issues and volatility related to FX and commodity markets.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass, we will be happy take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session, operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we\u2019d like to get to an important part of today's call taking your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted via the telephone. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar","Two questions on Private Brands. First would be, I think last quarter Gary you\u2019ve talked about service levels in that unit being up to, back up to sort of a 98% level and really the key was just getting past, lapping these pricing concessions and then there were a bunch of things that you\u2019d listed, that start coming through in the fiscal second half, that would start to improve margins? And then on this call I think you did mention some service issues still lingering. So I am trying to get a sense was there a step back in service levels or I guess I am still not clear really on what changed that you wouldn't have know about last quarter, that's now going to sort of push back the timing on being able to improve the margin structure at Private Brands? And then I've got a follow-up there.","Gary Rodkin","All right, Andrew, I am going to let Paul tackle that one.","Paul Maass","Yes, so the way I would frame it up for you Andrew is the a lot of the service progress that we have made clearly around just the on-time delivery, fill rate and structural improvements, a lot of the things we\u2019re referencing were due to planned consolidations and their very structural nature. And we have made a lot of progress, but we have more work to do. Kind of the, what's new in the way we\u2019re defining it is the overall service with our customer, clearly on-time fill rate those are important, but the way we interface with the customer in everything that we do to strengthen that partnership with them. And that's really what we\u2019re getting at here is beyond those very service metric type of things, the overall relationship.","Andrew Lazar","If we think about then what\u2019s changed, if we look at what your expectation was for EBIT in the Private Brands based for the full year last quarter versus what it is today, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how much of that sort of downgrade if you will was just the timing lag between cost and pricing versus some of the other things that you sighted, competitive bidding and promotional levels by the brands and such. I think the general question here is, it seems to be still not nearly a level visibility right, but I think folks want to see whether it\u2019d be internally or externally around kind of getting your arms around this business and I\u2019ve gotten the question a lot this morning, it is a $45 million per quarter run-rate in EBIT is that the right just longer term run-rate in terms of profitability for this segment, because you\u2019re supposed to have a lot of -- a lot of the synergies really ramping up in Private Brands in the back half of this year and again it doesn\u2019t seem like any of that will flow through obviously in a positive way, so it\u2019s a long way to question but trying to get a sense of really what\u2019s changed because I don\u2019t still have a great sense for that I have to say?","Paul Maass","Yes and Andrew let me just -- I get what you\u2019re saying and it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m just going to add pretty quite a few different points of context that will I think help connect some of the dots. And I\u2019d start by just acknowledging that the business is clearly not where we want it to be or expect it to be and it\u2019s a point of frustration for our entire organization. To state the obvious, it\u2019s been more difficult and taken longer than we originally planned, but I think an important point is these issues they are fixable. The earnings revision that you see is from my perspective it\u2019s a delay in our recovery, but it\u2019s not a long-term problem. One point that I would share with you, I expect and have a lot of confidence that the earnings growth in '16 is real, I have confidence that we will be able to deliver it and we continue to have a lot of confidence that the Private Brands industry will be a faster growing part of the overall food industry, so our vision and our belief and confidence in Private Brands in total hasn\u2019t changed in spite of the short-term challenges.","As far as the headwinds this year that maybe you could call it more of a surprise in nature. We are dealing with softer Private Brand category performance, that\u2019s real, impacts volumes you see that in the results. We also as John mentioned the inflation and it is intense and it is impacting our snack, nut and pasta business, because the cost is immediate. We\u2019re taking pricing actions but it lags. And that is an element where it ties to confidence in the improvements in '16, but I would say beyond the headwinds probably what\u2019s most important for us to do and where I would say the biggest issue is, is really around our execution. We\u2019ve lost business because we\u2019re not in front of the customers the right way and simply put it\u2019s just takes us too long to do basic things that our customers expect us to do. And that\u2019s why we have a very focused turnaround plan to get this business on-track. And I don\u2019t want to get too windy, but I think probably not only yourself but others have questions on what are we doing to turn the business around and I just -- I want to go ahead and hit that head on and share some of that perspective.","And our turnaround efforts are focused on four areas and I start with our customer. We\u2019re committed to narrowing our focus and what we have found is where we have narrow focus, we have better performance and more confidence from our customers and more stable just overall performance and where we have stressed to too thin and added some complexity it\u2019s hurt and so we know what we need to do and that\u2019s really about making those adjustments so that we are more effective. The reality is our customer brands are usually important to them. They have to have confidence in their suppliers. We do have confidence, our customers\u2019 confidence in many areas, but if there\u2019s an area where you lose it you have to be aggressive and earn it back and that\u2019s absolutely what we\u2019re focused on.","The second area is really is around the commercialization and the speed of that and so where we have one business is taking us too long to get that executed and into market and it\u2019s obvious when you do that the sooner you do it the sooner the new sales is realized and it improves the performance of the business. Third I would bucket around cost and service management. And I kind of went into the service, but the reality is we have to service our customers in a cost effective way. We have made progress, but there\u2019s still more work to do and it\u2019s got to be customer-by-customer very granular in nature to embrace the unique dynamics by category, by customer and that\u2019s exactly the direction we\u2019re headed. The fourth one is really around the connectivity in our business and I would just reflect on the inflation that\u2019s hit us this year. When you have better internal connectivity, the impact -- we have to be able to navigate through those dynamics effectively and we will with better internal connectivity. Fundamentally I would just wrap it up there with that Andrew is that as we do all these things, we truly will be a value-added partner for our customer and we can get there on a lot of that is founded in these execution improvements that we've got to implement.","Operator","And we will take a question now from David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll","Gary, Paul I add apologies but I do want to follow-up on private label here. I wanted to take just a slightly different direction. So TreeHouse has reported that it has seen three straight quarters of organic volume growth. So like Gary I as heard you on the comments about the intensity of the environment, but when I look over at another very big, I know it's a different portfolio of private label, they actually see pretty good strong volume growth that I mean they give us this commentary that some of the traditional retailers are really starting to see some strength when you look at Kroger and some of their numbers, I mean things look better but you guys are seeing I mean, what was the volume in private label, it was down 6%. I mean that's an enormous figure. Given the kind of price contraction that the Company took many months ago, I would think that the one thing you would have protected was your volume. So can you kind of marry up what's the difference between the strength that this other big private label entity and why just the volumes are just so weak?","Gary Rodkin","Dave, that's absolutely a fair question. I'd start by saying from an industry standpoint there are clearly players that are doing well. You referenced one big one. Consumers are more and more accepting of private brands and customers that are winning are emphasizing their own label and we know overtime, the up market trend is going to continue and that will play well into our skill set and we know that customers are going to be more and more demanding on supply chain efficiencies, food safety analytics and all that will leverage our infrastructure. But frankly, we are challenged from an execution standpoint. This is truly a tactical, not a strategic question. We haven't done a good enough job on things like speed and on customer service levels and there have been some specific issues on customer service levels, Paul referenced some but we've had some supplier issues as well, that have hit us, that's not an excuse. Overall, our issues are truly our own execution and what we need to do to drive growth is to level the playing the field on service of speed before we can really start to take advantage of any other kind of CPG capabilities that we've talked about.","So I can't overemphasize the point that we do now have while the learning curve has been slower than it should have been, we should have moved faster, we do now have a turnaround plan that has four pieces to it, our effectiveness and efficiency work on Private Brands has addressed some of that, but we need to go further to address the pain points and we have to break some of the bottlenecks that we have but they are really around customer responsiveness and speed, improving our commercialization processes, better overall service levels and better connectivity between supply chain and sales. So I know that's a bit repetitive from Paul's answer but I just want to point the gun clearly at our own execution issues. I know that this is fixable. These things are fixable. We just need to do a much better job and move faster and I think we now have all the resources in the focused sense of urgency to do that. I wish it had been faster, but the bottom-line is we now have that action plan in process.","David Driscoll","Okay, I\u2019ll pass along\u2026","Gary Rodkin","And David, sorry David and clearly we will see a material impact in F16.","David Driscoll","Well, that's very important. Thank you.","Paul Maass","Hey, David just one thing I would add is the points you made on our competitor, it is an element of why I am still confident that the outlook on Private Brands is very positive. When we do all the things Gary just mentioned, there is a lot of opportunity here.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman","I guess, well just getting off of the private label topic for a second, John you\u2019ve kind of written in the press release there was some hedge accounting adjustments that are going to happen going forward. I haven't heard that from other companies. Is that just a function of your ingredient base and its volatility? And then kind of what, so what should we expect, a little mark-to-market within the segments that you are going to pull out or you can't pull it out and it means it's more volatile? Maybe I\u2019ll just, I\u2019ll have that one and then a brief follow-up.","John Gehring","Yes, Eric good question. I am going to try not to get too technical, but historically a portion of our hedges have been, we've used some indexed hedges and this quarter we regularly look at how effective we think those hedges are and I think as we review those, the effect on this of some of these hedges this quarter, we determined that that effect in this was lower than we had planned, probably due to a lot of factors. When that happens, I think just good accounting requires that we change our methodology and recognize those mark-to-market impacts directly under the segments versus what we ordinarily do which is we temporarily defer them through corporate expense. I think in terms of what it means is, what you\u2019ll see is that we\u2019ll change the timing of when we recognize any of these losses or gains. And I think it could add some volatility to our results over the next couple of quarters as we unwind these positions. To be clear, it\u2019s just a portion of the hedges we use and my sense is that this issue will be done once we unwind from these hedges, it was just the case where again because of a variety of factors we felt like the effectiveness or correlations if you will had dropped to a level where we felt like we should go to mark-to-market on that subset.","Chris Klinefelter","And Eric this is Chris I\u2019ll build on John\u2019s point and just say that, we\u2019ve taken the volatility that John was talking about and the impact on our numbers, we\u2019ve taken that into consideration when we are giving you our guidance.","Eric Katzman","And then Gary, this is a just kind of maybe focused on the Consumer segment for a second, obviously you\u2019ve got a big frozen portfolio, that category in total has been really tough kind of going back to the great recession. And maybe there\u2019s some signs out there that the consumer health particularly middle-class maybe even lower income is getting a little bit better with the gas price relief. Do you see any signs of recovery in that segment at all from -- with not just your business, but just in total and maybe a little broader perspective on what\u2019s happening with the consumer there and I\u2019ll pass it on? Thanks.","Gary Rodkin","Sure Eric. Thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start and then I am going to turn it over to Tom for some more color. The economy is still challenging for most Americans and I think we\u2019re all aware there\u2019s overcapacity on both sides of this industry, manufacturers and retailers, so that dynamic continues to play out. However, there are some positives you named one. The gas prices should be putting more discretionary income into the pockets of the core consumer who -- where that really could make a material difference so we hope they are going to spend some more of that on the food side, both at home and away from home. And we are now left -- have left the SNAP cuts from last November the food SNAP cuts, so both of those factors should be positives as we go forward. And it\u2019s just important to remember, this is a really large landscape, so there\u2019s room to grow by improving fundamentals like we\u2019ve talked about in perfect at retail. But in general, I would say we hope that as an industry we\u2019ve kind of bottomed out and are looking forward -- but let me turn it to Tom, because he can give you some really good color on frozen and the rest of this portfolio.","Tom McGough","Eric this is Tom McGough and let me just provide a little bit of context in frozen and what we\u2019re seeing. As you know, it\u2019s a big and important category not only within our company but with our customers. And as you noted, overall category has been down. But overall I think it\u2019s important to note that those declines have been concentrated primarily in the nutrition segment. The premium and value segments are relatively stable and that\u2019s where our two largest brands are positioned in those segments. As Gary highlighted today and as we spoke about last quarter, we captured the number one share position in single-serve meals last quarter and we actually extended our share of leadership this quarter. And I think what\u2019s important to note, this second quarter we posted the highest profit we ever have in the second quarter on our frozen portfolio. So we built our share of leadership and we also delivered record results. If you look at the fundamentals of our business, we continue to invest to grow Marie Callender's and we\u2019ve achieved great results not only in our single-serve meals but in the other platforms. We had a great holiday season on frozen desserts and our frozen multi-serve platform continues to grow.","As I said the nutritional segment is challenged and we are building share in that segment with Healthy Choice. We\u2019re posting very strong gains on Caf\u00e9 Steamers and we continue to build our business around that platform. And as Gary highlighted, we introduced a line called Simply Steamers this quarter and those are products that are made with no artificial ingredients contain, and 100% all natural chicken. And it\u2019s really on trend with the desire from consumers of minimally processed foods. And we also price those at a higher price point. And that residence with the consumer despite the higher price point we\u2019re off to a very good start.","Finally as we look at the rest of our frozen portfolio, we invested heavily in P.F. Chang's. When you go to a restaurant you then typically order an appetizer and your entr\u00e9es are served with a rice side dish. And we have restaged our business to sell that bundle, improved the appetizers, improved our multi-serve meals and we just introduced a line of frozen rice and we are off to an incredibly strong start on that restage. So overall while the frozen business is challenged in aggregate, our performance has been very strong this quarter and over the last year. And this is a category that we are going to continue to invest smartly to build the category to our brands.","Operator","We\u2019ll take a question now from Sanford Bernstein's Alexia Howard.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask about the sticking on the Consumer side, the advertising spending being cut down, that's something we heard about from a number of companies recently, what's the thinking behind that particularly in terms of the long-term investment behind the brands and do you expect that to change going forward or do you expect to stick with setting up promotional activity? Thank you.","Tom McGough","Sure, Alexia. This is Tom McGough and let me address that. I think there is a couple of perspectives here; first and foremost as with any investment we have an ROI approach to allocating our resources. And I think you can appreciate given the breadth of our portfolio, we focus our resources where we are getting the highest return and we are increasing spending on several brands. Marie Callender's, our tomato platform of Hunt's and RoTel, Slim Jim, and specially brands Reddi-Wip and PAM. We have the fundamentals right on those businesses, we continue to invest our volume and share continues to increase. But our perspective is that traditional marketing is only one investment in our brands and we take a more holistic look at the investments that we are making in our brands particularly in getting the fundamentals right. And where we've invested rather significantly has been on, I can highlight a couple of businesses, Chef Boyardee we invested to improve our products, packaging through the easier lid. The business has responded very-very nicely with our volume up fairly significantly over the last quarter. Importantly, that's coming from non-promoted based volume grow and we see a good trajectory and a higher return from that investment.","I just talked a little bit about P.F. Chang's, but we invested to get the product, the pricing, the package right at retail that's resonating incredibly well with consumers and we are seeing strong double-digit growth. And the last thing I\u2019d highlight is that as a company, we placed a much bigger emphasis and we've made more investments to grow in alternative channels. As you know, increasingly consumers are shopping in Club and Dollar stores. The win in these channels requires us to have customized product and packaging. But marketing in these channels is very different. Driving trials, if you go through a Club store, driving trial happens in-store, that's how you get the trial and awareness and that's very different than the traditional broad-based advertising, but we are reconfiguring our go-to-market approach, how we invest to drive trial and awareness in our brands and we are investing in many of these customer specific programs that are reflected in our P&L as trade spending and not as traditional A&P. Because you take a step back, we are investing in our business, we do it in a very holistic manner, we are having very good impact from those investments and we will continue to have that lens of ROI, effectiveness and impact that drives our investment decisions.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Do you mind if I could just ask two questions if I could. The first would just be in relation to the cost savings commentary that you shared if I recall you have given like an overall cost savings figure. Are we still on-track for the -- I think it's 125 to 150 for the Private Brands division?","Gary Rodkin","Yes, we are still in that range for the Private Brands and overall we are looking at 350 to 375 across the entire enterprise. Hello? Chris did we lose you?","Chris Growe","I am there, can you hear me?","Gary Rodkin","We can now, yes.","Chris Growe","Okay, sorry for that. Just a question about the Private Brands division and with the volume weakness, what seems to be persistent volume weakness, is there anymore activity, I guess I am trying to get to are there more cost saving potential here now, while things have been a little slower in terms of their rebuild, are there plant closures are things you can do because of the volume environments get a little bit more aggressive on cost on that division?","Gary Rodkin","Fundamentally yes, and one of the things that we referenced was just the accelerated cost that we have in our business today around supply chain initiatives where the benefits are getting stretched out and that does, it\u2019s around improved distribution network, consolidation, production consolidation and we will continue to drive optimization on that it\u2019s a really important part of the overall plan.","John Gehring","And I guess the only other thing I'd add Chris is as we work through the execution of the plan that Paul and Gary have talked about, certainly as we try to more tightly wire the business, that might also result in less touches, that\u2019s a certain things that might give us a chance to streamline some processes even further than we have through the first phase of our effectiveness and efficiency work.","Operator","We\u2019ll move now to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Lubi Kutua","This is actually Lubi on for Akshay, just had a question on your Consumer Foods business. So the margins in that business where really strong this quarter, I mean I think looking at our model it seems like strongest has been since at least the second quarter of 2010. So trying to get your thoughts on sort of sustainability of that margin performance in Consumer Foods for instance and I think there was a question earlier about sort of your level of brand support, but what gives you comfort that you are not cutting brand support too deep maybe in Consumer Foods such that it could affect the long-term performance there?","Tom McGough","Sure our margins well this is Tom McGough and our margins are what you reflect and it\u2019s a combination of strong productivity, being able to execute pricing to offset commodities, a strong discipline on the trade side to be very surgical, to meet marketplace conditions and we believe we\u2019ve balanced those very-very well and our margins have been very strong. And as I previously said, we look at our investments very holistically. And we are investing in our business for the long-term, making sure we have the right fundamentals on the businesses that I highlighted as well as continuing to invest in businesses to sustain long-term performance. So our focus is certainly around building a foundation that sustains growth overtime. And I think we feel we\u2019ve hit that sweet-spot of discipline, while still investing behind our businesses not just in traditional A&P but in other areas to make sure we have the fundamentals right. And that\u2019s going to provide a foundation that we will consistently grow from.","Operator","Another we\u2019ll hear a question now from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","I think every question, every possible question has been asked. I\u2019ll ask about international though. You mentioned some customer specific issues. I want to know if you could give us a little more color on what that is and how much did it affect the quarter and is it a short-term or is it something that affects the back half of the year? And maybe quantify the West Coast labor strikes and how much that affected the quarter and why that would just be a short-term issue as well?","Paul Maass","Yes, so Rob this is Paul and I feel that commentary is all around our Lamb Weston business and the softness in those Asian markets are really fundamentally rooted in the -- there is a food safety issue from a meat supplier with some of our key customers it hurts our business. It is sequentially improving. And the outlook is that it will continue to improve. There are commitments on building out the market there, opening new stores continues to be very positive and the right outlook and we\u2019ve positioned ourselves to partner with them and enable that growth. The West Coast the port slowdown very real, our exports do go through those ports. They\u2019re running I think you see that publicly but it\u2019s running around 50% of capacity. And like every other industry we\u2019re working through it, the sooner it gets resolved the better. Not a real big impact on the second quarter, but something that we\u2019d definitely want to see get resolved so we can serve our customers and hit everything that they need.","Operator","And there are no further questions Mr. Klinefelter, I\u2019ll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Before I close I know that Gary wants to offer some thoughts.","Gary Rodkin","Yes just in closing, I want to reiterate that basically three quarters of our business, the two biggest sectors are performing well their foundations are much stronger than year ago. And that we\u2019re managing our cost structure very well, the effectiveness and efficiency work is really playing a part there. The Private Brand business has an intensely focused sense of urgency and resources aimed at this turnaround, but I want to reiterate we believe in the strategy. It\u2019s a bold move that we undertook and it\u2019s a big transformation. We have strong conviction that Private Brand will be a growth sector in the food industry long-term the issues we have again to repeat are our own execution, there\u2019s no escaping that. These issues are fixable. We will drive growth long-term from this business. And with that, I will wish everyone happy holidays see you in the New Year.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you, Gary. This concludes our call today. And just as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and it will be archived on the Web as detailed in our news release. And as always we are available for discussions. Happy holidays and thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods.","Operator","Thank you and this concludes today\u2019s ConAgra Foods\u2019 second quarter earnings conference call.

My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I am Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll talk about our strong second quarter performance, offer a few comments on the strategic rationale of the pending Ralcorp acquisition and then we'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.","Before we get started, Chris has a few remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. If you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and affect our business, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, Q&A document or on our website under the Financial Reports and Filings link, then choosing Non-GAAP Reconciliations.","In regard to Ralcorp, I'll remind you that we are still some time away from closing and finishing our plans for an integration timetable. Many of the financial details will need to be shared at a later date. That will be after we close -- that will be after we close the transaction, of course, complete our planning work. We won't have any new details on those matters today, and we do look forward to updating you on those in the future.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. I am very pleased with our second quarter, where we've posted good growth for both operating segments. EPS on a comparable basis was $0.57 for the second quarter, up 16%. The overall quality of the quarter was high, with strong profits even as we increased marketing investment for the base business by 18% as part of long-term brand building. We're raising our fiscal 2013 expectations to comparable EPS of at least $2.06, which includes a strong increase in marketing for the full fiscal year. That estimate does not include any fiscal 2013 benefit from the pending Ralcorp acquisition. That benefit will be determined after the transaction closes.","In terms of our operations, let me start with the Consumer Foods segment, where sales were up 11%, driven by acquisitions. Organic volumes were down 4%, and price\/mix was favorable by 4%. On an unrounded basis, organic volume improved sequentially from Q1 by about 60 basis points. We expected overall organic volumes to be down given consumer purchasing trends in the still challenging economy and importantly, the pricing we took in recent quarters to combat inflation is also a factor. In addition, we have been very disciplined with our pricing architecture and, in some cases, we've deliberately chosen to improve profit margin instead of growing volume.","Acquisitions drove the overall sales growth, but several of our brands also posted good organic results. We expect volume trends to continue to improve sequentially throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as we more fully lap last year's price increases and as the benefit of the recent innovation, marketing and Customer Connect initiatives continue to accelerate.","Frozen, as you know, is a big and important retail category. We continue to innovate here, building on our strength in frozen single-serve meals and increasing our presence in strategic adjacencies such as multi-serve meals and desserts. We're also investing in more marketing in frozen to help bring more growth to the category.","With regard to the quarter, once again, the Marie Callender's brand performed well overall. Single-serve and multi-serve frozen meals showed very good growth in dollars, volume and share. The Marie Callender's Baked platform that allows the consumer to get oven-baked quality in much shorter time in a microwave is doing well, and we've taken that innovation to the Healthy Choice brand, and the baked entr\u00e9es are doing well there, too.","We have a strong adjacency story in Marie Callender's dessert pies. We're off to a good start in the holiday season in terms of both volume and share, and our Healthy Choice Greek Frozen Yogurt, whether you look at that as a dessert or snack, has performed well since we launched that a few months ago.","In other parts of the store, Reddi-wip and PAM, both leaders in the marketplace, posted very strong growth in share, dollar and unit sales. PAM's innovative new no-residue recipe focuses on its strong competitive difference. We're communicating about that now on air, and it's clearly driving sales.","We also were pleased to see gains in other core businesses, driven by marketing investment, which is our Hunt's campaign -- that's on air now -- communicating the key Hunt's point of difference: flash steaming. We're looking forward to more breakthrough innovation in the new calendar year.","In January, shoppers will begin seeing a new product line from Orville Redenbacher's that's unique. This innovation is called Pop Crunch and is truly different. This is a ready-to-eat popcorn with a very significant crunch. It has half the fat of a regular chip and allows us to compete in a bigger way in salty snacks. We introduced this product at the National Association of Convenience Stores trade show this fall as part of 18 new branded items. We also launched 10 store brand products, such as those from our pretzel business, as well as products like energy bars. There was a lot of excitement from the C-store owners, which, as you know, is a growing and important channel, especially when it comes to snacks.","We're very pleased with the profit trends in our Consumer Foods segment. Comparable operating profit grew 8%, and that's with the 18% base business marketing increase that I mentioned earlier. Our margin management played a big role in our profit growth, and that's evident in our strong organic price\/mix, as well as good productivity efficiencies. We're also incurring more manageable inflation and the benefit of some good hedge positions. Overall, those elements mean higher margin dollars relative to the year-ago period.","Acquisitions meaningfully contributed to the profit growth. We've done 6 transactions over the last 12 months or so, all good businesses that strengthen our foundation. And I'm happy to report the integration of those acquisitions is going well.","Moving on to Commercial Foods, the segment performed well in the fiscal second quarter, up in both sales and profit. Our Lamb Weston potato operations performed well with notable success in international markets and ongoing strong operating efficiencies. Lamb Weston posted favorable price\/mix and good volume. Demand for our potato products is strong, requiring us to add capacity. We announced last month a $200-million expansion to our Boardman, Oregon plant -- potato processing plant, which will increase our capacity for making french fries and other frozen potato products.","Within ConAgra Mills, as a reminder, last year's second quarter milling profits were very strong, making for an extremely tough comp. So as expected, we experienced a slight year-over-year decline in that business this quarter. We're pleased with the productivity, cost savings and mix of products sold in our Commercial segment overall, and we continue to focus on products and innovation that drive both the top and bottom line.","As we mentioned last quarter, although retail demand for food prepared at home continues to be a bit soft, away-from-home eating occasions, particularly in QSRs, have held up well, and we've benefited from that in our Commercial Foods segment. We've had success in bringing innovation into the commercial and foodservice space, which has helped our mix across this business segment. And that focus on innovation and efficiencies is representative of our commitment to helping our customers grow.","Before I move on to offer a few comments about Ralcorp and our excitement about the benefits of that pending transaction, I'll repeat that we are pleased, very pleased, with the organic performance of our core operations in both segments. You've heard me talk before about how critical it was for us to get our foundation right, and we have made an incredible amount of progress on that. I'd like to say thank you in this holiday season to my team, who's worked so hard to get us here. From the very substantial cost savings generated by our supply chain over the last several years to our industry-leading platform innovation approach, to our strength in customer partnerships and our more disciplined pricing architecture, we're seeing the benefits of our improved operating capabilities across our business.","It's that type of progress with the foundation of our company that gives us confidence to significantly add to our portfolio. It's great to be in a position to leverage our capabilities for accelerated growth, and that's exactly what we've begun with the 6 recently completed transactions. And of course, it's our plan with Ralcorp. The Recipe for Growth has us focused on 3 main areas: one, core adjacencies; two, international; and three, private label. All of the 6 completed transactions we've announced over the past 12 months or so have been aligned with this direction. We've exercised strong financial discipline, and we're well positioned for growth. The Ralcorp transaction will clearly be a game changer in terms of our private label footprint, and it supports our goal to be the fastest-growing and true industry leader in the private label space.","We're very excited about this for 3 main reasons: first, the growth prospects for private label in general; second, the strong private label business and market segment leadership that Ralcorp has; and third, the CPG capabilities that we can bring to this business. Along with the talented Ralcorp team, we plan to utilize our CPG capabilities to accelerate top line growth, realize synergies and strengthen strong customer relationships. Our innovation, supply chain, category management insights and other consumer-centric -- customer- and consumer-centric capabilities will help us to drive strong top and bottom line results from this business over time.","In our view, the private label opportunity for the future is one that retains the customer responsiveness and agility while adding strong CPG capabilities to partner with growing customers. And it's a different business from the one that many people historically associated with private label. Meaning, one where it was only about low price, low margin, product emulation and generic packaging. The business has evolved a lot from there based on customer and consumer expectations, with Ralcorp playing a key leadership role. Therefore, our focus will be on value-added opportunities with strategically important customers, taking a business model for private label that we expect will consistently post strong top line and bottom line growth over time.","We're confident that we can manage this business well alongside our branded operations. We've been doing a version of this for many years and understand where the 2 types of businesses need to be separate for marketplace reasons and where they can be combined for efficiencies. We'll be working with the Ralcorp team to figure out the optimal structure. We're not in a position today to discuss specifics on organizational design, but the point I want to make is that we respect the differences in the 2 types of business, and we will absolutely find the right balance.","I'll also reinforce that we expect this deal to be accretive in the short term and long term and will say more about financial details when we're further along in the process.","In closing, we believe it's a great time to be part of the ConAgra Foods team with all the exciting developments underway and ongoing confidence in sustainable, profitable growth.","At this point, I'll wish you all happy holidays and turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on 4 topics this morning: our second quarter performance highlights; comparability matters; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and finally some comments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013.","Before I start, I'll remind you that my comments today will focus predominantly on the results of and our expectations for our base business, exclusive of the impacts from our recently announced and pending acquisition of Ralcorp. As we've noted a couple of times, and during our conference call last week -- or a few weeks ago, we do expect to provide a more complete update on the impact of the Ralcorp acquisition on our 2013 and 2014 fiscal years in due course after the transaction has closed. At that point, we will be in a position to provide more details on matters such as the near-term performance expectations for the Ralcorp business, the financing structure, the purchase price allocation, synergy timing, as well as other matters.","Now let me address our business, starting with the fiscal second quarter performance highlights. Overall, the second quarter results reflect a continuation of the good business trends that we saw in the first quarter. For the quarter, we reported net sales of $3.7 billion, up 9%, driven by pricing and acquisitions in our Consumer Foods segment. And in our Commercial Foods segment, we had modest volume gains in Lamb Weston, as well as improved mix and pricing across the segment. Net sales also reflect the impact of higher year-over-year wheat prices in our flour milling operations.","In this quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.51 versus $0.43 in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.57 versus $0.49 in the prior year quarter, a 16% increase.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few highlights, starting with our Consumer Foods segment where net sales were approximately $2.4 billion, up about 11% from the year-ago period. This reflects about 11 points of growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales were essentially flat as favorable price\/mix of about 4% was offset by a base volume decline of about 4%.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $293 million, or up about 8% from the year-ago period. The operating profit improvement reflects the benefit from acquisitions, our margin management initiatives, moderating product cost inflation, as well as a significant and planned increase in marketing costs. The impact from foreign exchange this quarter on both net sales and operating profit for the segment was immaterial.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $80 million in the quarter. For the fiscal second quarter, we experienced inflation of about 2%, a bit better than our expectations.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $133 million, up about 31% from the prior year quarter and principally driven by an 18% increase in marketing investments in our base business.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion, or up about 5%, reflecting modest volume growth at Lamb Weston due in part to strong international growth. Higher net sales also reflect improved pricing and mix across the segment, including disciplined pricing to offset higher input costs. The pass-through of higher wheat cost in the milling operations had a positive $11 million impact on sales for this fiscal quarter.","Commercial Foods segment's operating profit increased 5% from the year-ago period to $169 million. The strong year-over-year performance reflects continued good fundamentals in all of our commercial business units. I would also note that the prior year quarter was one of our strongest ever, so we're very pleased with this year's second quarter results.","Corporate expenses, adjusted for items impacting comparability, were $63 million for the quarter versus $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower benefit costs and the favorable impact from the timing of certain costs within the year, and all of that offset by some higher incentive costs. The reported tax rate and the rate on comparable earnings for this fiscal quarter was approximately 34%.","Now I'll move on to my second topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.06 of diluted share -- or $0.06 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter's reported EPS related to several items.","First, on hedging. For the fiscal second quarter, the net hedging loss included in corporate expense was approximately $16 million, or $0.02 per share. In addition, we recorded approximately $15 million, or $0.03 per share, of acquisition-related expenses. Also, we have some small amounts of restructuring and related costs and rounding that accounted for the other $0.01 of comparability items.","Now I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items.","First, we ended the quarter with $477 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We continue to emphasize cash flow within our business. And for fiscal year 2013, we expect to deliver strong operating cash flows in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, exclusive of the impacts of the recently announced and pending Ralcorp acquisition.","On working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full fiscal year, we expect that working capital improvements in our base business will contribute modestly to cash flow from continuing operations as we maintain our focus on cash conversion cycle metrics.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter we had capital expenditures of $82 million versus $65 million in the prior year period. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to be in the range of $500 million, including fiscal 2013 requirements for our recently announced expansion at our Lamb Weston facility in Boardman, Oregon.","Net interest expense was $53 million in the fiscal second quarter versus $51 million in the year-ago quarter. Dividends for the quarter increased from $95 million in the year-ago quarter to $97 million, reflecting a higher dividend rate, offset by a lower number of shares.","Now let's turn to capital allocation. In light of the pending Ralcorp acquisition, I think it's safe to say that we have prioritized growth. The transaction is very significant and will affect our capital allocation over the next 18 to 24 months. Specifically, as we have previously noted, we intend to maintain our dividend at $1 per share and significantly reduce our share repurchase activity until we deleverage and return to more normalized debt metrics.","And on share repurchases, I would note that we purchased about $170 million of our shares in the fiscal second quarter. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $280 million of available share repurchase authorization.","And while we plan to constrain our acquisition activity in the near term as we repay debt, we will continue to prudently support the right investments for our business, including investments to support innovation, production capacity and our cost savings initiatives.","The other elements of our balanced capital allocation approach remain unchanged. We are confident in our ability to maintain our investment grade credit rating. And while we plan to limit dividend increases over the next couple of years, we are committed to our strong dividend over the long term.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2013 outlook. As Gary mentioned, we currently expect fully diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability and excluding any impact from the Ralcorp transaction, to be at least $2.06 per share. Our fiscal 2013 earnings estimate also reflects net sales in the range -- net sales growth in the range of 7% to 8%, the sales growth for the Consumer segment expected to be in the high-single digits, primarily driven by our recent acquisitions. And in our Commercial Foods segment, we expect modest top line growth in the 3% range.","And for the full fiscal year, we now expect net inflation to be around 2% to 3%. And we expect cost savings to exceed $250 million in our Consumer Foods business.","Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be in the range of 34% for the full year, although this rate may fluctuate somewhat from quarter-to-quarter.","Overall, we're excited about our performance in the first half of the fiscal year. And as we look at the second half, we expect both operating segments to continue to execute well on the fundamentals. We also expect a strong year-over-year increase in our marketing investments in support of our brands and innovation. The second half EPS outlook also reflects a modest amount of unplanned dilution resulting from the reduction in share repurchase activity. Overall, we are confident in our ability to deliver very attractive earnings growth for fiscal 2013.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to wish everyone a happy holiday season and thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Andr\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions.","I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we'd like to get to an important part of today's call, taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess my question is about trying to get a better sense of some of the key drivers of gross margin in the quarter. You mentioned that a number of things came in perhaps a bit more favorably in the quarter: inflation, up about 2%; strong productivity, which was up sequentially from the first quarter; and you still had 4% pricing as well. So I'm just trying to get a sense of perhaps why gross margin, at least on a year-over-year basis, wasn't stronger in the quarter and if there are some things in there that are harder for us to see that might have impacted it in the quarter?","John F. Gehring","Yes, Andrew, this is John. I think you certainly named a number of the drivers in terms of what's working well in the margin line. Clearly, inflation was down a little bit from where we expect, and productivity and pricing are all well. I think we have seen some gross margin improvement. I'm not sure where the expectation would have been but certainly, I'd say we might have had a little bit of unfavorable mix even though our pricing mix overall was very positive. So I would say that's probably the one decliner of the bunch.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. In other words, John is saying that the price mix of 4 leans more towards price and a little less towards mix.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then I certainly understand the strategy you're employing around protecting profitability sort of above all else right now, and the strong commitment to sort of the pricing discipline and such certainly shows that. And as you expected, volume was going to be down for a part of the year, and it's coming in sort of as you would have thought. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- at what point -- I guess how closely can you monitor the threshold for which volume goes past the point at which you're comfortable, in terms of ceding some share in certain businesses for a period of time to protect profitability? How closely can you kind of monitor that? And at what point do you get a sense that the impact is too great, let's say, on planned absorption or things like that?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew. As you know, our portfolio is extremely broad, so it's a bit different by each segment. But I can tell you that we clearly have our finger on that from a threshold standpoint, as we take a look at market share in particular. I would tell you that we're where we expected to be at this point in the year and that in the second half, you're going to see us show more top line improvement. And that's really primarily timing. We were probably a little bit later than some of our competitors in terms of where we took the bulk of our pricing. So at this point in the year now, we're about 70%. We've overlapped about 70% of the pricing that we took from last year. That's why as we go through the rest of the year, you'll start to see more improvement. Obviously, we've made some good investments in marketing innovation, et cetera. So I think, maybe, and I'm going to turn it to Andr\u00e9 here in a minute, Andr\u00e9's team is not chasing the volume. They're being very careful about this balance, and that truly is reflected in the margin improvement. So let me ask Andr\u00e9 for a little bit more color on that.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes. Thank you, Gary. I'd say, Andrew, you -- we've talked about the discipline and the resources we've put against revenue growth management. So from your -- your first question's perspective was around what are the thresholds. I mean, we look at our plant absorption, we look at market shares very critically and make sure that we've got the right balance. And it's not only -- what you saw in this quarter was not only a good operating profit flow-through as we've talked about, but really, this investment back in our brands. I mean, we've been very deliberate at talking to folks about -- this was an organization that historically relied a whole lot more on trade than it did on classic pull. We're trying to change that balance a little bit and really invest in our brands. And you saw in this quarter relative to the amount of investment we made against the marketing, which we believe is critical as we build the brand. So I think we've got the balance right. We have a lot more metrics than we've ever had, and the team works really hard against that. So we are poised to course correct when we need to. But right now, we're staying really disciplined, and you saw that in the net realizable price flow-through that you saw and the margin flow-through, and that allowed us to invest back in our brands.","Operator","And we now have a question from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted just to ask a little bit about, John, the guidance in terms of first half, second half. First half shows -- I think it's about 25% earnings growth year-over-year; and then the second half would show, I think, fairly limited growth or maybe even just about $0.01, I think, in the second half. And maybe -- could you guys pull together some of these comments about why the pressures would build so much? Because -- perhaps it's just you guys are being conservative, nothing wrong with that, but we're trying to get a sense here of if we have moderating inflation and the expectation that volumes are going to grow, third quarter in the year-ago margins just got hammered. And so it feels like a -- I hate to use the word easy comp, but I will. So can you help me just understand the back half of the year and why such limited EPS growth expectations?","John F. Gehring","Yes. So let me start with a couple of things, David. As we look at H1 versus our -- first half versus second half, the first thing I'd tell you is that we still expect both business segments, both of the operating segments, to perform well and have good fundamentals and show good results at the operating profit line. One thing I just -- I'd remind everybody of is that if you look at the first half, we have had some softer laps in the first half. And in particular, I think we were very clear that our first quarter a year ago was very soft. We had a number of things, especially in the Commercial business, that we lapped in a very strong way this year. So on average, the laps, and in the absolutes, the laps are stronger in the second half. The other thing I would note is that -- to kind of piggyback on to Andr\u00e9's comment about really focusing on investing behind our brands, we are maintaining a fair amount of flexibility for what I would term to be some fairly significant increases. And maybe I should say ongoing increases in our investment behind our brands. So we're certainly, I think, maintaining a fair amount of flexibility there. And then the other thing, just mechanical I would note, is that we do end up with some negative impact at the EPS line because we're going to terminate or essentially terminate and restrict our share repurchase activities. So we would have a plan -- we would have planned for some accretion there, which won't happen. But I guess the other comment I'd make is that we feel very confident about the 206, and part of our change in raising our guidance was to be clear that we don't see this as coming in below there.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I could add one question on the Commercial Foods, Gary, I really appreciated your comments back at CAGNY on Lamb Weston and was hoping perhaps if you could spend a moment talking about the export opportunity for Lamb Weston. And if at all possible, could you remind us or tell us about kind of the dollar size of that opportunity over time?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. David, that is a really exciting, significant growth vector for the company. Big opportunity that we have really shined the light on. And let me ask Paul to give you just a little bit more color on that.","Paul T. Maass","Sure. And one I'd just highlight, they've mentioned the Boardman, Oregon, plant expansion, and that's an important strategic investment for our Lamb Weston business and is very much aligned with our growth in the emerging markets and what we see there. And we have a lot of momentum there. We feel really good about what we are executing, and we're making the right kind of investments to continue that growth going forward. I don't know, I think you had a question around the specific size. We probably won't get into that. I just -- I would say double-digit growth is what we're experiencing, and we're doing the right things to make sure that we maintain that.","Operator","And Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Bryan Spillane has our next question.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So my question is about just the contribution from acquisitions. Can you talk to -- can you give us a little bit more color in terms of -- not so much how -- how much they've contributed to the growth, to the base, but how the acquisitions themselves are performing on their own? So as you've integrated them, are the -- have the sales growth for the acquired properties accelerated? What type of growth rate are you seeing in those businesses? And then also, if you could give us some idea of what the earnings accretion was in the quarter.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. I -- Bryan, I'll just tell you that we're very pleased with the integration. So we're definitely right on expectation for each one of those acquisitions. And we expect over time that they are going to be top line and bottom line accretive, because that's been the discipline in terms of our acquisition strategy. So I think, over time, you'll see each one of those live up to that. The contribution to our Consumer Foods businesses is important, but I -- before I give it over to John, I'd also just want to reiterate that the core Consumer Foods business grew operating profits too while still maintaining a significant increase in marketing, which obviously is a long-term benefit. So the core business is strong, but significant contribution from the acquisitions. And these acquisitions are all consistent with our strategy, particularly in the area of core adjacencies. John?","John F. Gehring","Yes. Gary, I think you covered a lot of it. I would probably emphasize a couple of points. Year-to-date, our base Consumer business at the operating profit level has contributed an awful lot of the growth. Acquisitions are making a good contribution and in line with our expectations. So I think things are on track, and we're very pleased with how the contributions are coming in. And again, I would reiterate Gary's point that while the bases contributed less than half at the consumer line at this point, we also do want to remind people of the significant increase in A&P that we've got in the base business numbers.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But you feel pretty good about the -- your ability to execute the integration? I guess that's my -- that's the point I'm trying to get at, is you've made some acquisitions and now you're proving to yourselves that you can integrate them well and add to them as you brought them into your portfolio?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Bryan. As we've talked a bit about before, we've got an extremely disciplined process that is not only on the front end but on the back end from an integration standpoint. So we keep the spot light on these acquisitions for quite some time before we basically turn them into our base business model. We clearly have a number of metrics that we review regularly, and I would tell you that the answer is yes. Every one of the acquisitions, we feel very good about at this point and continue to believe that long-term, that they will be, as I said, top and bottom line accretive.","Operator","And we'll move now to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to build a little bit on Andrew's question, I was hoping to dive a bit deeper into the increased consumer marketing spending. There seems to be a bit of a divergence of strategies among food producers right now. On the one hand, I guess you have companies like you and Heinz among others, and they're really redoubling their efforts to, I guess, raise advertising and build that consumer pull. And I guess, on the other hand, you have other companies like Mills, Campbell Soup that are temporarily and tactically doing the opposite, right? Shifting some marketing spending away from advertising and toward promotions. And if you look in comments by groceries like Kroger, I mean, most promo -- promo spending is the way most companies are going right now. So I'm a little long-winded here, but I'm just curious if you're seeing a lot of your direct competitors in your categories promoting heavily? And if so, are there maybe some tactical moves you can make to combat that until we're in more of a normal promo environment?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Ken, this is Andr\u00e9. Let me take some of that and if Gary has something to add to it. I think -- again, I would say that we are spending appropriately behind our business on the brands that make sense and have a meaningful point of difference in terms of the marketing mix. So I'll get -- we've given Marie Callender examples time and again, and that brand is performing very well against that. But we've also talked about PAM, PAM cooking spray and the whole non-residue formula being a point of difference to consumers and really communicating that message. And that brand has responded very, very well. The same with Reddi-wip, which is a combination of both the messaging there, as well as the ability to merchandise that with host foods such as our pies, but also in the summer and in the springtime with berries and fruit and things like that. And then Hunt's Diced Tomatoes, where we're really putting an effort on our point of difference there, which is really on flash steaming. So we believe we need to do that to make a meaningful difference and to show consumers that there are meaningful differences in our brand. But that doesn't mean that all our brands get marketing. We have brands that play a different role. So there are brands in our portfolio that don't get a lot of the marketing mix that really rely more on in-store merchandising and promotions. So we actually balance, I think, that equation very well. I would tell you, though, Ken, at the outset of the year, we said that this organization has to make sure that it puts some of its money back into the pull. Historically, it has not. I see competitors. Depending on the category, it's very different. You cited a few that are downplaying marketing and putting a little bit more in trade. Again, that's their strategy. And in some cases, it's right for their brand and right for that segment. For us, we believe that we have a lot of the things working well, and that's why we are very, very pleased with the results you saw in the first half of our year and right now in Q2.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Ken. I would tell you you're asking exactly the right question. It's the kind of debate that we have with the management team on an ongoing basis, and it's all about the right balance, whether it's between the different brands or it's between the trade spend, merchandising and marketing.","It's really something that we have to continually rebalance over time. And as we watch what happens in the marketplace, obviously we'll try and stay as disciplined to our strategy as we can be, but we're pragmatic and realistic at the same time. So this will continue to evolve but right now, as Andr\u00e9 says, we're pleased with where we are, and we'll continue down this path.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One other question, guys. You may have touched on this and I missed it, but given the Ralcorp deal, are there other tack-on additions that you -- is that off the table for the next 12 months? Other deals? Or if a great opportunity comes to you and it's small, do you still have the, I guess, desire and capability to take that on?","John F. Gehring","Yes, I'll take a shot at this, Ken. This is John. First of all, we won't say absolutely no to anything. I think it is important to recognize that -- probably, even more so than the financial constraints we're putting on again, and we've got -- we feel very comfortable with where our debt rating is going to be and investment grade, and we think we'll have some room in there. But probably, more important than that is just making sure that anything that comes to light in the next 12 months is so compelling that we -- and we have confidence that we can take it on from an additional integration standpoint. We've made a big bet on the Ralcorp acquisition, and I think our management team and our board are very aligned around making sure that we execute the integration as flawlessly as possible. So again, that's not an absolute no. We still probably have our line in the water for things. But we're going to be pretty disciplined and focused on the task at hand.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Janney.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask specifically about the trajectory of cost and the effect it's having on your business. You mentioned 2% cost inflation. It seems like we got a spike in June, July. They've been moderating sequentially. I noticed particularly the Commercial Foods business isn't back anywhere close to the kind of margins you were doing in fiscal '10 or '11. So I guess, just looking forward, should we expect a moderate cost environment to just, in and of itself, drive margin expansion because of the stickiness of pricing in that business, or I guess the lack of pressure from cost in that business? And it maybe premature to comment, but I know that aspect really well describes Ralcorp also. Do you have any thoughts about what that means to numbers in -- not only the rest of this year but going forward from that? Just that relief that could come.","John F. Gehring","Yes, let me -- this is John. Let me take a shot at that. I think most of your question was revolving around the Commercial business, and I don't have all the margin stats in front of me. But one of the things we get mathematically in terms of margin compression is just driven by the milling business. Because as wheat prices go up, we tend to manage margin dollars in that segment versus margin percentages, because it's a large pass-through. So that over the years can certainly have some impact on margin percentages, because I think overall, during the last few years, we've been pretty comfortable with the margin dollars we've generated in that business. As it relates to the inflation environment, I do think -- in some of those commercial businesses, it can be really kind of be a mixed bag. In the milling business, you got something that really is much more of a pass-through business. But certainly, as the competition for acres has heated up over the last couple of years, some crop prices and some key input costs I think that we face in the Commercial segment have faced a lot of pressure. And I think that's -- that's been one of the challenges that Paul and his team have successfully navigated through. But Paul, I'll maybe turn it to you, to see if you have anything to add to that.","Paul T. Maass","Yes. I think just in operating the business, we'll price accordingly the pass-through inflation or deflation and really focus on driving business improvement through operational efficiencies and mix, as well as really lean hard into the international growth opportunities.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And if I could just ask one follow-up, please. When you looked at the Ralcorp acquisition and you think about those numbers, do you consider the base of profitability this year at Ralcorp to have been depressed by the trajectory of cost this year and therefore, potentially seeing some relief if cost trajectory is flat or even down in future periods?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. We really can't talk a whole lot about Ralcorp right now. But what we can tell you from the public disclosure information is that there were clearly some discrete events this year that won't be repeated next year. So the numbers are really kind of apples and oranges as we look forward.","Operator","And we have a question now from David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You commented that volume trends should improve into the second half. I would imagine Banquet is going to be a large part of that in the Consumer Foods division, maybe even the majority of your expected improvement. But perhaps you can comment on areas and reasons for potential volume improvement into the second half?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Hey, David, this is Andr\u00e9. So you're absolutely spot on. That has been the #1 volume drag for us from the beginning of the year, and that's largely because we took over 10% pricing on that brand. So absolutely, as we come out of Q3 and Q4, as it laps that pricing, it significantly gets better. So again, for us, a lot of it -- we said this upfront. As Gary articulated, 70% of our pricing has been lapped in Q1 and Q2. Q3 and Q4 obviously have the remainder of that, but it's much more moderate. You'll see the advertising that we've talked about that we're putting against the business. That doesn't kick in day one. Obviously, you don't get an immediate bump for the work that you're doing there. You get -- it improves over time. So we see the advertising and what we've been putting on help us also sequentially get better. So we do have our forecasts and plans for the back half of the year, see our volumes sequentially getting better from where we are today based on those things: lapping the price and the marketing. And the innovation that we've launched also starts to benefit from obviously getting full distribution. Then we have some new innovation. Gary articulated Pop Crunch. That's going out in January. And we have a couple of other C-store items that we're launching as well, that we feel pretty good about. So you'll see new innovation and then the benefit of all of what we launched in the early part of our year, getting to 80, 90 ACB distribution, and then you'll see the benefit of that as well.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then from that high-teens marketing reinvestment, where are you expecting to see -- or are you already seeing the best response from that investment?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","I mentioned some of those brands already. I mean, we continue to just -- I can't say enough about what the marketing team and the brand team on Marie Callender's have done, not only in the core business but what they've done kind of in the dessert space as well, winning -- we've really started the holidays off very, very strong there. I see it in areas like PAM. I see it in Reddi-wip. I see it in Hunt's. Our Chef -- canned pasta business has done very well from a market share standpoint, both in units and in dollars. So I can -- I see the marketing campaign on that brand working. So we see a lot of those things working, and it's going to be different by brand. But overall, I feel very confident that, that's working in the marketplace.","Operator","We have a question now from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So first question is actually on the Lamb Weston business. I know it's been doing really well, and so congratulations on that first. But we've heard some negative commentary from Yum recently on China. Can you just put that into context in terms of your opportunity? I mean, how -- does that impact your sort of near-term trajectory on that business? And how exposed are you indirectly to China?","Paul T. Maass","Yes. So I won't get into specific comments on customers by name. Overall, what we see in emerging markets continues to be very, very positive, very favorable trends, and we look for that to continue. And we're positioned well and continue to penetrate those markets and really support our customers' growth. And I think quarter-over-quarter, you may have some ebbs and flows. But over the long haul, we feel very good about it and very optimistic and think the growth trajectory is very good. And, just maybe one of the comments just on our ability to execute. We're very focused on efficiencies, and we've got an ability with our manufacturing footprint in the Pacific Northwest to reach those markets in a cost competitive way. And we like that position very well.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I would just add to Paul's comments that the numbers continue to be very, very good, double-digit growth in the emerging markets. So we saw that same news on Yum, but there's a big emerging market out there, and we continue to have a lot of confidence in that segment.","Operator","And we'll move now to Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The number of brands in your Consumer business that are growing has been declining steadily for a year now. Would a turnaround there come from just easier comps or improving consumer -- I mean, why wouldn't I be worried about this?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Well, Thilo, this is Andr\u00e9. I think the large -- the largest issue we have, as I articulated earlier, is the pricing comps we have year-over-year. So I think what you'll see in the back half, is you'll see a steady improvement in that. If you looked at our Q1 to Q2 comparisons in both IRI or Nielsen, whichever service you subscribe to, you'll see that our -- of our top 15 categories, you'll see that we significantly moved both dollar share and unit share in 10 out of those 15, and it was a significant improvement Q1 to Q2. We expect that same improvement to continue to flow out of the year as we lap the pricing.","Operator","We have a question now from Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you to start with -- about your outlook for the next 6 to 12 months for food-away-from-home or foodservice. What are you incorporating in your outlook there?","Paul T. Maass","I would just comment that overall, the trends are better and improving. Yes, I would say October was kind of a little bit of an outlier kind of across the industry, we saw that, and with a decent [ph] rebound in November. And yes, I think -- I don't have a specific number I'd give to you, but I think the trend that we've seen over the last 12 months is really kind of the outlook for us going forward.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions. I guess, Gary, your -- you have a consumer product, a branded consumer product background. You're the first, I would say, major packaged food company that's embracing private label. You mentioned that there is much more margin in that business as it stands today versus years past. So I was wondering if you could go a little bit more into that, why you think that's true and how that, I guess, impacts both the Ralcorp business that you're going to acquire and maybe some of your existing brands and private label potential. And then is there any way you could comment on the $350 million -- I think it's $350 million of equity that's proposed in the deal? Is there -- like I'm just kind of surprised that the rest of it wasn't borrowed and -- or is there some kind of tax implication or something that you would use equity as a relatively small part of a major deal?","John F. Gehring","Hey, Eric, this is John. Let me start on the equity piece of the transaction. It is a relatively small part. And again, just to reiterate for everybody, what we said is we will issue up to $350 million of equity. It's a small part. I think it was -- it's included primarily to make sure that we have some cushion, sufficient cushion in our debt rating. And quite frankly, I think it's something that our bondholders and our rating agencies viewed as -- even though it's not significant as a percentage of the transaction, I think they viewed it as an important acknowledgment that we are going to continue to balance or promote a strong balance sheet. So again, we'll be able to tell you more about the exact amount as we get closer to close. But it really was just to give a nod to our commitment to a strong balance sheet.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. Eric, I would tell you, kind of the headline is we're not doing private label the same way as everybody in the industry is doing it, meaning a lot of -- there's a lot of players in this very fragmented industry. And I think the reason we feel so good about it on a go-forward basis is there's a number of reasons: One would be, as you take a look at other developed economies, you see a significantly bigger percentage of the food business being done in private label. And then if you take a look at the customers that are doing the best, for the most part, in this country, they're the ones that are emphasizing and, in some cases, almost exclusively private label. So there is clearly a consumer pull for what has become a much higher quality product. Very, very different than it was -- that we remember, say, back in the '70s, '80s when it was much more generic. Consumers continue, particularly in tough, challenging times, to try store brands, and they are pleasantly surprised, and they keep coming back. And we expect that will continue beyond the recession. We have very little overlap in the private label businesses that are coming from Ralcorp with our core or with our current base business. So we're not looking strategically, for the most part, to compete in the same basic segments from a private label and a branded standpoint. And maybe the most important factor of all when it comes to the better financial viability is that it's going up market.","There's a lot of gearing of the private label business. In some cases, some would call it good, better, best. In some cases, the stores, the customers are looking to make a statement with their own products that they have an awful lot of interest in, in growing their own brand and making product that is very high quality. That's what gives us a lot of confidence as we go forward that it's not going to be just about the lowest priced, half-penny bid. And I think Ralcorp has already done a pretty good job in terms of being selective in the kinds of private label businesses and categories that they've gone after. There's a lot of value-add opportunities because of this consumer\/customer pull. So when you wrap it all together with the significant amount of synergies that we will bring, along with the significant capabilities that we can add to an already strong, biggest leading private label player, wrap that altogether, that's what gives us a very, very high degree of confidence again that this is going to be both top and bottom line accretive for us.","Operator","Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse has our next question.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I had a -- I was just looking at the popcorn business in my Nielsen data. I'm seeing some big volume declines and a lot of pricing action. And I was just wondering, Andr\u00e9, I noticed that the quarter, Orville is back up again, which is a good sign. What's your outlook for the Orville brand? And is there any way that you can extend that into more snacking occasions like handheld snacking occasions? I see, in my town here, Popcorners and all kinds of popcorn snacks that are in a bag and want to know if that's a possibility for Orville.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Thanks, Rob. I think you're absolutely right. We saw the same numbers that you've just quoted. I think to understand the backdrop, we took 2 price increases on Orville last year in period 4 and period 7. So we were lapping that. So we're finally getting through most of that. And as you look at the back half of the year, we have gotten through -- we will have gotten through most of it. So you'll start to see that rebound. What we're seeing with consumers is a move from microwave -- still a big, viable business -- and to this notion of ready-to-eat bagged snacks. And we're actually capturing that trend as well. We've had really good performance with our first launch of our Orville ready-to-eat product in standard flavors. And then now, Gary articulated we're launching Pop Crunch as well. It's being launched in January, or being shipped as we speak to retailers. You'll see us doing more of that as we see consumers moving to that convenience and that ready-to-eat. We believe the Orville franchise is very strong, and we have a lot of opportunities. And Al Bolles and the innovation team are looking through what exactly can we do with that franchise beyond the ready-to-eat offerings that we have today and other things in microwave? We think we also have some opportunity in microwave as well with various blends and other things that we can do with popcorn. So we feel really good about the franchise. A very strong franchise.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicholas.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a quick question for you, which is, as you're being a little more diligent around promotion, could you characterize your new product plans? It would seem to be like an important component of that plan. I guess, do you have a lot more activity maybe in your -- a lot better -- higher quality activity? And then if you've just seen any improvement -- or what stage you're in, in terms of marketing in frozen. You talked about that being an area where you're marketing more heavily. Is that -- are you seeing any improvement from that -- in that category?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes. So Chris, let me start with the latter part of that question. We are -- as you know, we are touching the frozen space now, not only in meals, our single-serve meals, which historically has been where we played, and we're doing really well there with Marie and doing reasonably well with Healthy Choice. The whole healthy segment, though, where we compete, is one that is really a challenge. But we're also going into these adjacencies, so you've seen us recently with respect to Marie Callender pies, both the full-sized pies, but also introducing smaller, single-serve desserts pies, if you will. Our launch of Healthy Choice Frozen Greek Yogurt, which has had specific advertising for it, has actually done very, very well. We're very pleased with that. So -- and you'll start to see us do some things as we get into more snacking occasions in frozen, as well as breakfast. You'll start to see us do that more there. And we obviously, with the assets we've acquired in multi-serve, or totally in [ph] P.F. Chang's, are really excited about that, that brand, because those equities are very, very strong with consumers, and it brings a new consumer to that franchise, a consumer that typically makes $75,000 a year or more. So we're bringing other consumers into our franchise, which has been heavily weighted towards value consumers in the past.","So we feel really good about the marketing we're doing there. And with respect to our promotions or our in-store activity, we do put a very significant emphasis on -- when we're launching new items. So some couponing, sampling, store demos, if you will, really to get people to try and taste the food, which we believe -- the proof is in the eating, so to speak, and we do very well there. We're very happy at the launches that we've done so far, our innovation. It's tracking against the forecast that we have for all the products. And we feel very good about where we are.","Operator","And Sanford Bernstein's Alexia Howard has our next question.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Gary, you've obviously done a nice job this morning of explaining the rationale for the Ralcorp acquisition by talking about premium private label products and partnering with key retailers and looking maybe to overseas models on private label as something to emulate. As I think about Ralcorp's categories, on cereals, I look at the 2 big-branded players and how focused they are on innovation and how much money they have to put into that. And then maybe in another category, I think about dry pasta, and I don't see a lot of premium innovation going on in there. But when you talk about channels and maybe targeting, I don't know, the Whole Foods' or the Costco's more premium private label product, I can kind of understand that. So I was wondering if you could just give some examples. Is this a channel focus where you're going to be maybe focusing on more of a premium outlet, small private label products through the Ralcorp deal? Are there specific categories where you've got examples, where Ralcorp does that really well, just to get me a better feel for how this is all going to work?","Gary M. Rodkin","Sure. The answer is it's kind of all of the above. So clearly, there is very strong development and opportunity in channels that really emphasize store brands. So, for instance, Ralcorp does a great job with folks like Trader Joe's and Costco. And clearly, there are products all over the stores there that reflect that. One small example would be some of the frozen pasta meals in Trader Joe's that are a terrific product. Maybe you've tried them. But that would be one example of, I would call, a very much value-add product. In our own shop, what we've done with our bar business -- so for instance, at 2 of our -- 2 biggest customers, you've seen us not just emulate product in the nutrition bar space, but actually create new product that has done very well. And that is very much value add. If you go into some of the categories that you talked about, it's really a different story by category. So you're right. There's a lot of tough, big players with big resources in the -- like the RTE cereal business, and we'll have to be very selective about how we play there. Ralcorp's done extremely well thus far. We expect that to continue. But we'll place our bets selectively, and it's really both a category and a customer channel story. And we think there's enough pockets in both of those places that we can continue to do really well.","Operator","And there are no further questions.

This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","","Before we get started, Chris has a few remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the result that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance, can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A document or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. As we announced a little more than a week ago, we got off to a slow start in fiscal '14. While that certainly isn't the way we wanted to begin our fiscal year, I can assure you we've been taking action and we're very focused on the actions required to drive improvement throughout the year. For reasons we'll discuss today, we're confident in our revised full-year EPS, as communicated last week, which results in 8% to 10% growth over last year's comparable full year diluted EPS of $2.16.","For the quarter, we posted EPS of $0.37 on a comparable basis. As context, we originally expected to be in line with year-ago amounts, which means we were anticipating we would get close to a $0.44 quarter. When we first gave that guidance, the main reasons we expected to be only in line with year-ago amounts, as opposed to growing, were primarily because we planned for some significant incremental investment to support new product launches, and because the impact from a customer transition in our Commercial Foods business was expected to be the most pronounced in our fiscal first quarter.","So with that reminder as background, we underperformed our prior EPS goal, mostly because of poor volume performance in the Consumer Foods segment. As we go forward in the fiscal year, we have plans to improve volume and we anticipate cost favorability, driven by lower-than-planned inflation, as well as better-than-planned SG&A cost savings, all of which suggest better quarterly trends.","In a nutshell, we expect those positive factors to collectively offset a portion of the Q1 EPS softness and enable an 8% to 10% growth year, with the growth coming in the second half of the fiscal year. To be clear, we are reaffirming our expected comparable EPS growth rates in the fiscal 2015 to 2017 timeframe, where our Ralcorp synergies are planned to be the richest. Our view of Ralcorp synergies is unchanged at $300 million in fiscal 2017, and we're as confident in the long term about our strategy and direction as we've ever been.","Now I'll talk more about specific results within our segments. As a reminder, our segments will change later on this fiscal year, and John will say more about that. In our Consumer Foods segment, sales were down 2%, acquisitions contributed 2%, organic volume declined 3% and price\/mix was down 1%. Within the price\/mix, we had significant slotting allowances related to new product launches. That was part of our plans and it's concentrated investment level that won't be repeated this year.","In our base in Consumer Foods, we saw weak volumes given challenges within certain customers and categories. Several categories have returned to more intense price competition as customers tried to drive traffic back with more deals. Our change in tactics, particularly for the remainder of this fiscal year, include a shift to become more impactful with our promotions and merchandising, as well as more focused on better mix through improving the velocity of our higher-margin products. That means we have shifted some dollars from advertising to merchandising to be more competitive. Said simply, we're acknowledging that in this environment, we need to be more price-competitive in certain categories. We had been on a path of increasing our marketing dollars over the last several years, but this environment calls for some course correction toward more in-store merchandising. And we've begun the process of the category-by-category, customer-by-customer basis, and most importantly, within financially responsible guidelines.","Why are we confident that increasing our merchandising will drive a lift in volume? We know from past experience that when we get our fair share of merchandising, we get a lift in volumes. To be clear, we don't like this kind of environment. It's not ideal for long-term brand health and margins. But we will do what's necessary to improve volume in a fiscally responsible way. A reduction in our least efficient advertising spend, continued productivity gains and a sharper focus on SG&A, will enable us to shift funds toward merchandising to invest, as needed, in this environment. I want to be clear that it's not all about changes in merchandising and promotion. We will continue to support our brands that respond well to advertising spend; brands like Marie Callender's, Bertolli, Reddi-wip, PAM and others. This is simply about balance and what is needed in the current environment.","We launched a number of items into the market in Q1 with early mixed results. Certainly, some of our recently introduced products are doing well. For example, our new Bertolli items, premium meals and desserts, along with our Marie Callender's single-serve cakes are doing well and are on track. But for a few of the new items this go round, quite frankly, we got the price value equation wrong. What I mean by that is we believed the premium quality of our Marie Callender's breakfast sandwiches and our Orville Redenbacher's Pop Crunch, for example, would command a premium price in their respective categories. So even with superior products, we know we need to work harder and smarter at getting the value equation right.","The incremental investment to support the new product launches was significant at $26 million or $0.04 a share. This represents over half the year-over-year decline in the Consumer Foods operating profit. The good news is these were concentrated upfront costs associated with planned introductions. We don't have any more large new product launch costs planned for this fiscal year. So that means a big portion of the segment's 22% year-over-year profit decline is over and done with. So this quarter's profit comparison is not a good reference point for a trajectory of the remaining quarters this fiscal year.","In summary about this segment, we see improved input cost inflation dynamics over the course of the fiscal year. We have line of sight to more SG&A cost savings than we did at the beginning of the fiscal year. And as we think about volume in Consumer Foods for the rest of the year, we believe volume will improve behind the increased merchandising that we're planning, and we expect that lift to help with absorption in our plans. John will say more about what we're expecting in terms of top line and bottom line for this segment for the full fiscal year.","In the Commercial Foods segment, sales were in line with year-ago amounts and operating profits were down as expected. As we talked last quarter, within Lamb Weston, we planned to be down in profits due to loss of some business from a major customer. As we said, we knew there would be some margin impact at Lamb Weston during this transition, but we are very confident that over the long term, we will make up for this loss and continue the strong growth we've seen from the frozen potato business. We've already begun expanding our business with other customers and we expect to see continued progress as the year goes on. While the loss of business is tough, we planned for it in the first quarter and we've worked very hard to recover from it quickly. And it's great to see some stronger contributions from some other customers already.","Our milling operations posted growth in sales and profits. As you've heard us discuss before, we remain focused on product mix, efficiencies and customer supply chain and risk management solutions, and it's been paying off. Overall, the year for Commercial Foods is on track and we remain confident in delivery of the year as planned. Just as a reminder, as we look further into fiscal 2014, we plan to contribute our milling operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment, into a joint venture with Cargill and CHS, called Ardent Mills, where we will have 44% ownership. We believe this is a long-term strategic win in terms of customer supply chain solutions, efficiencies, expanded innovation capabilities, and of course, profits. Forming this venture will provide us with cash to accelerate our debt repayment. We expect this joint venture be accretive to our EPS in a couple of years, and John will say more about this.","Moving on to the Ralcorp operations, for the quarter, sales and profits were a bit behind our expectations and we attribute this to the softness in the overall retail market. And as we described last quarter, dealing with the fallout from their past restructuring efforts and suboptimal pricing actions. I'll say more about that in a minute. We're on track with a $0.25 of EPS accretion this year.","We've made very good progress in integrating the organization and we now have all the leadership positions in place. This will play a key role in correcting the pricing and organizational issues that I discussed earlier. The leadership positions were a critical aspect of our work over the last several months, and while it will take some time to get all of our processes wired exactly right, it feels great to have a strong team of talented and experienced leaders in place. The caliber of people that came from Ralcorp, along with those from ConAgra Foods and those recruited from other companies, plus the way we've designed our organizational structure, will help us intensify our focus on customers and categories.","Rebuilding the leadership team and the sales force from the Ralcorp restructuring that took place a year ago, several months before the transaction, is part of this work, and we are getting those customer-facing positions in place as we speak. We believe the focus here will begin to pay off as we get to our new structure and people in place with our customers. We've already had a few early wins that will be realized in the back half of our fiscal year.","With regard to other near-term marketplace opportunities, our conversations with customers about our capabilities, like product and promotional innovation, are already beginning to work. Customers are very receptive to our innovation ideas on private brands, and they see our innovation capabilities as true differentiators in the marketplace. We're also putting our insight capabilities to good use in terms of product pairings. You'll hear more about that from us in the future.","We like what we're seeing on cost synergies. We're off to a good start and on track with expectations for fiscal 2014 and are confident about our projections. As a reminder, we're projecting $300 million of annual pretax savings from cost-related synergies in fiscal 2017, and given the lead times, the big ramp-up starts in fiscal 2015. I want to remind everyone that our plan all along assumed that in the early days of integrating Ralcorp, we would drive cost-related synergies faster than top line-related synergies. Most significant top line benefits are expected later as we get the new organization in place and begin to leverage our capabilities. That's the way it's playing out, and it's what we expected. I'm very confident in our strategy on private brands, recognizing it requires a bit of patience. We're playing for the long term. We can see the opportunities ahead of us and we feel good about the progress we're making.","So to summarize the quarter and our perspective on the rest of the year, we acknowledge that our Q1 performance fell short of expectations, and that we have work to do to deliver the revised year. With that understanding, I'll leave you with these 3 elements of our confidence in the full fiscal year. One, our Commercial business is largely on track. Two, the Ralcorp integration and synergy realization is going as expected. Three, our course correction in Consumer Foods can be achieved through more impactful merchandising to drive volume improvement as well as commodity input cost favorability and SG&A cost savings.","Thank you again for your interest in our company, and I will now turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on 4 topics this morning. First, I'll discuss our fiscal first quarter performance. Next, I'll address comparability matters. Then onto cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. And finally, I will provide some comments on our updated outlook for fiscal 2014.","Let's start with our first quarter performance. Overall, as we previously communicated, the fiscal first quarter results were below our original expectations and reflect the impact of several matters we planned for, such as marketing investments in our Consumer Foods segment and the loss of some contracted business with a significant foodservice customer in our Commercial Foods segment. However, as Gary noted, we also had a shortfall in our earnings relative to our plans for the first quarter, and that was driven principally by disappointing sales volumes in our Consumer Foods segment. Overall for the first quarter, we reported net sales of $4.2 billion, up 27%, driven by the addition of Ralcorp, partially offset by the softness in our Consumer Foods segment.","For the quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.33 versus $0.61 in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.37 versus $0.44 in the prior year quarter, a 16% decrease.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few points, starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $2.0 billion, down about 2% from the year-ago period. This reflects about 2 points of growth from acquisitions, offset by a 3-point decline in base volumes and 1 point of negative price\/mix. Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $189 million, or down about 22% from the year-ago period. The operating profit performance reflects the volume softness and the increased marketing costs, partially offset by the benefit of our margin management initiatives. The higher marketing costs for the quarter reflect incremental costs of about $26 million, or about $0.04 per share, in support of new product launch activity, which for 2014, was concentrated in the first quarter. So spending levels will naturally be lower in subsequent quarters.","On foreign exchange for this quarter, the impact of foreign exchange on net sales and operating profit was immaterial. Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $45 million in the quarter. For the fiscal first quarter, we experienced inflation of about 2%. And on marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $104 million, up about 14% from the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in new product launches.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion, about flat with our prior-year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit decreased 7% from the year-ago period, to $130 million. The year-over-year decline reflects the expected decline in our Lamb Weston business related to the loss of contracted business with a significant foodservice customer, as we noted last quarter. Operating profit for our flour milling business was modestly higher than the prior year quarter.","Our Ralcorp operating segments delivered net sales for the quarter of $942 million. And operating profit, excluding items impacting comparability, was approximately $83 million, slightly below our expectations reflecting volume softness across several categories, consistent with some of the trends we've seen across the broader food industry. Given the adverse impacts of pre-acquisition restructuring activities, suboptimal pricing actions and some adverse commodity positions at the time of acquisition, we expected to be working through some challenges during the integration period. We took these challenges into consideration in our guidance and therefore, we remain on track to deliver $0.25 per share of accretion for the full fiscal year from Ralcorp.","Our new organization structure is being implemented, and the new leadership team is in place -- sorry, is in the process of implementing changes to improve business trends. Given the size of this undertaking, the impact on results will take time and we expect performance to begin reflecting the benefits of these changes in the back half of this fiscal year. I would also point out that our fiscal first quarter is historically the smallest quarter seasonally for the Ralcorp business. So I would caution against any linear projection of the first quarter results as a proxy for the full year results. We are making good progress on both COGS and SG&A synergy work streams. However, we expect that product cost synergies will be realized principally in the second half of the fiscal year. Overall, our synergies are on track.","We currently report the result of Ralcorp's operations in 2 segments: The Ralcorp Food Group segment and the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products segment. As we've noted, we are currently in the process of building out our new reporting structure, and we expect to transition to the new structure during the second quarter of this fiscal year. After the transition, we expect to report our results in 3 operating segments: Consumer Foods, Private Brands and Commercial Foods. The Consumer Foods segment will include substantially all the branded businesses that are currently included in our current Consumer Foods segment. The Private Brands segment will include the consumer private-branded food businesses previously included in the Ralcorp Food Group segment and the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery segment, as well as the private-branded business previously managed within our Consumer Foods segment. The Commercial Foods segment will include the Lamb Weston, ConAgra Mills, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and J.M. Swank businesses and certain foodservice businesses previously included in the Consumer Foods and Ralcorp Frozen Bakery products segments. Once we implement the new segment reporting, all prior periods will be restated to reflect the new segment structure.","Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $127 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $72 million versus $75 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year change reflects the addition of Ralcorp corporate expense offset by lower base operating costs, including pension costs and some timing issues. Our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year is estimated to be approximately 34%, consistent with our planned rate. The rate for this quarter was lower driven by several favorable settlements and changes in estimates, some of which are treated as items impacting comparability.","Now I'll move on to my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.04 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter's reported EPS from continuing operations' related to several items. First, transaction costs, acquisition-related restructuring and integration costs, principally related to our acquisition of Ralcorp. In all, we recorded approximately $37 million or $0.05 per share of net expense related to these acquisition matters. On hedging for the fiscal first quarter, the net hedging expense included in corporate expenses was approximately $21 million or $0.03 per share. And finally, we recorded a tax benefit of about $22 million or approximately $0.05 per share, primarily resulting from a change in estimate related to tax methods used for certain International sales.","Next, I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $194 million of cash on hand and $280 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We are very pleased with our cash flow performance and discipline over the past several years. And in fiscal 2014, we expect cash flows from operating activities to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, including a modest contribution from working capital improvement.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $181 million versus $98 million in the prior year period. And for fiscal 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. Net interest expense was $96 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $49 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is driven by the additional interest expense related to the Ralcorp acquisition.","Dividends for the quarter increased from $98 million in the year-ago quarter to $105 million. On capital allocation, our capital allocation priority through fiscal 2015 will be the repayment of debt. Consistent with that priority, we currently expect to repay between $600 million and $700 million of debt in fiscal 2014, and a total of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2015. These amounts exclude any additional repayment we expect to fund from the cash proceeds related to the Ardent Mills transaction.","While we did not repay any debt this quarter, given the seasonal working requirements of our business, we are pleased with the progress we've made over the past several quarters on our debt repayment plans. And with respect to liquidity, this quarter, we extended our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility by another 2 years. The facility is now in place until September 2018.","As previously noted, we -- as we delever, we expect to maintain our current annual dividend at a rate of $1 per share and limit our share repurchase plans. This quarter, we did repurchase approximately $31 million of shares, funded principally from option exercise proceeds. And while we expect to limit M&A activity in the near term as we focus on deleveraging and integration, we will continue to review opportunities to improve our portfolio. We will also continue to prudently invest behind innovation, production capacity and our cost-savings initiatives.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we did announce 2 small transactions. First, we have divested our Lightlife business. And the results of the Lightlife business for the fiscal first quarter and all prior periods are classified as discontinued operations. And second, we repurchased certain dessert production assets from a former co-manufacturing partner, primarily supporting our Marie Callender's dessert business. The net cash and earnings impact of these transactions is immaterial.","With regard to restructuring charges related to Ralcorp, we do expect to undertake some restructuring actions as part of integrating the business. While we are not yet in a position to give financial details on the plans as they are still being developed, I would note that these charges, which should span a 2- or 3-year period, are not expected to materially impact our plans to repay debt or reinvest in the business. We expect that a significant portion of these charges will be noncash and that the cash requirements, when identified, will be manageable given our strong cash flow. We currently expect to provide an update on these matters after the close of the fiscal second quarter.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2014 full year outlook. We currently expect fiscal 2014 diluted EPS, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.38 per share. Let me briefly address the second quarter. First, while we are taking actions to strengthen Consumer Foods volumes, we currently expect that it will take some time to impact these trends, and therefore, we expect Consumer Foods volume and operating profit to be soft through the second quarter. And in Lamb Weston, the continuing impact of the foodservice customer transition issue will continue to impact profits through the second quarter. So while we will benefit from the Ralcorp accretion, which is on track, it will not be enough to fully offset the challenges in the other segments. So we currently expect our second quarter comparable diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.55, slightly below year-ago levels, which was a very strong quarter.","As you know from our full-year guidance and our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year, we are expecting a very strong second half of the year in terms of EPS growth. So why are we confident in the strong second half EPS projections given the environment we're in and the results we have posted so far? Well, let me start by saying that we had planned for the year to be second half-loaded given the investment we made earlier in the year for Consumer Foods and the customer transition issues at Lamb Weston. When we look at the back half of the year, it should go without saying that our top priority is stabilizing our Consumer Foods volume in a fiscally responsible way, which will involve redeploying some A&P into merchandising. And when I say stabilizing our volume, I want to be clear that we are not expecting heroics. Our expectations are that Consumer Foods volume will be about flat for the year.","And while the volume improvement is very important, it is not the main driver of the EPS growth we have planned in the back half. The biggest drivers of our back half EPS growth are the following 3 items: First, the contribution from Ralcorp, including the ramp-up of the synergies as the year progresses. And some of this improvement is really related to the normal seasonality of this business, but it also reflects the benefit of the organizational changes and integration progress. Second, we have identified significant SG&A savings, including some marketing cost reductions. And third, our Consumer Foods COGS inflation will come in lower than planned. These 3 drivers account for most of our back half EPS growth.","With respect to our operating segments, in Consumer Foods for the full year, we now expect volume performance to be about flat with prior year and operating profit growth to be in the low-single digits. We also expect somewhat lower inflation from continued good cost savings performance. We expect that our advertising and promotion costs will be modestly below the prior year levels, and as a reminder, advertising and promotion costs for fiscal 2013 reflected a significant increase over prior year.","In our Commercial Foods segment, we continue to expect a decrease in operating profit, driven principally by the 2 matters we noted previously. First, the impact of the Ardent Mills transaction, which we expect will have about a 3% -- I'm sorry, $0.03 per diluted share of negative impact to fiscal 2014 earnings. And two, the impact of about $0.06 to $0.07 per diluted share from the loss of business with a significant foodservice customer in the Lamb Weston business.","On our Ralcorp acquisition and integration, first, we continue to expect approximately $0.25 of total diluted EPS benefit in 2014, in line with prior estimates. We now expect fiscal 2014 sales related to the Ralcorp business be approximately $4 billion, slightly lower than our previous estimate in recognition of the recent top line softness and our current belief that it will take time for the changes to impact these trends. The integration is proceeding essentially as expected, and our synergy work continues on track to deliver $300 million of annual pretax benefit by the end of fiscal 2017.","In summary, we are working through some changes in our business but our capital allocation goals, which include significant debt retirement in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and our longer-term fiscal 2015 to 2017 EPS growth goals, which include realizing significant synergies from the Ralcorp acquisition, remain on track.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Tom McGough, and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just had 2 questions for you to start off. I guess first thing, Gary, when you provided fiscal 2014 guidance, ConAgra was about a month into your first quarter. And at the time, you were quite bullish around volume momentum in consumer and the prospects for Consumer Foods at the time. So something -- it would seem very dramatic must have changed in kind of a month's time from then to sort of cause ConAgra to lower not only the first quarter but the full year EPS so significantly. And you mentioned on the call some category weakness and some customer weakness. But frankly, I'm still not sure kind of what that means and whether that was just overall industry issues because it seems to have hit ConAgra maybe more significantly. So I was hoping maybe you could run us through a little bit around specifically what categories were real differentiators versus what you had thought a month before. And then these customer issues, were these things that were, perhaps, more discrete to ConAgra in terms of the impact to you? And the reason I ask is because this all goes towards how achievable the new full year EPS guidance is. That's the first question.","Gary M. Rodkin","Sure. Andrew, I appreciate that. Those are fair -- that's a fair question. I think we all acknowledge that we're still in a relatively sluggish industry environment. But as the summer went on, we saw trade spending accelerate, and this is because customers, key customers were competing for traffic and manufacturers really heated up their competition for market share, that we've been on a path of shifting toward more pull via marketing and advertising. But with the increased merchandising intensity in some key customers and some key categories, we frankly lost some share of quality merchandising and, in turn, market share and, of course, volume. We're now in the process of course-correcting that, rebalancing and shifting some advertising dollars selectively into more competitive merchandising support, all within responsible financial constraints. We'll see the benefits starting late in Q2 but primarily in the second half of F '14. But to get more specifics on the categories, let me turn it over to Tom McGough.","Thomas M. McGough","Yes, this is Tom. Our volume decline was concentrated in a couple businesses, most notably in frozen and on Chef Boyardee as a result of the strong competitive activity that Gary highlighted. First, in frozen, there's 2 things that are driving this activity. First of all, frozen is a big category, but volume has been weak. And this is an important category for our customers. And as a result, it has become a share battle in frozen meals. As a result, we saw a big increase in competitive promotional activity at several key customers during Q1. Similar situation on Chef Boyardee. As you know, we lead in the canned pasta category, but we really compete in a broader, shelf-stable, convenient meal arena. And the reality in Q1 was that we saw a much stronger promotional activity, particularly at the back-to-school period in that broader category. In both instances, we're strengthening our promotional programs to be more competitive. We anticipate that activity will be comparable going forward, and we know that when we achieve our share of merchandising support, we can improve our volume trends.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I guess my second question would be back in 2009, I think when the industry went through a somewhat similar dynamic, where there was some deflation and most industry players had ramped up promotional spend to try and drive -- to drive volume, which was weak at the time, as I recall, it didn't end up really helping industry volume very much at all. And it seemed that none of the kind of players in the food industry really ended up benefiting relative to anybody else. It just ended up taking sort of a big chunk of profitability, I guess, out of these categories as a whole. So I don't know, maybe Gary, you could just address that. Do I have that sort of right? And so I'm trying to get a sense of why maybe, if everyone starts to -- has been and promotes more aggressively, the consumer sees certainly better value, but it doesn't seem like anyone gets a relative benefit or advantage.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew, again, this is not our most desired way to see the industry operate. But we do, as responsible stewards, we do need to course-correct. And frankly, the customer in the competitive environment, along with this moderating inflation, means that we have to smartly rebalance our push and pull. Again, not black and white, not either\/or, but we got to put the dollars against where we think we'll get the most effective returns. We need to bend the trends on our market share. It is a market share gain. It's category by category, customer by customer. We've got smarter analytics, and we've got to put them to better use. But we truly need to grow our share in this environment, and we need to do it by driving quality merchandising. We have found ways in our P&L to make certain that it is beneficial to us financially. But again, this is what the environment calls for, and we will stay within those guidelines.","Operator","David Driscoll with Citi Research has our next question.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I'd just like to go back to the competitor promotional activity and maybe just try to get a bit more on this one. Because I would say, Gary, that when you cite this as a negative factor, I mean, it's always troubling to hear on the outside. And what I find is that no one knows how, on our side of the fence, how to dimensionalize how bad this thing is going to be. So maybe can you just give us, as best you can, just specifics on what happened? And I think the most important thing is, how rational is this pricing environment? I mean, when you have a quarter like this, it feels like the environment is completely irrational, I mean and I think Andrew was maybe even trying to get at the same point. If your forward view is based upon the return of rationality, I mean how strong is that at this point in time, and how much confidence can you really give us today?","Gary M. Rodkin","Obviously, David, there's only so much that we can share for competitive and customer reasons. But within that, I can tell you in our largest category, in frozen, we've been winning market share, as you know, over a number of years within this large category. A lot of that's been driven by really strong innovation, marketing, et cetera. But we can tell you that the intensity of the merchandising really ramped up in some pieces of some segments of that frozen category. For example, in one large part of the segment, merchandising that was, on average, about 4 for $10 or $2.50 apiece went to about 5 for $10 or $2 apiece and in some cases, hotter than that. We have been trying to stay on the path of driving towards more pull. But frankly, given the fact that we've won a lot of market share in several of these segments, we've seen competitors really dial it up this summer. So we've got to do what we need to do to win back that market share, and it's really not a return and hoping for an immediate return to rationality. It's really, in the near term, a return to our fair share of merchandising. Tom, want to add anything to that?","Thomas M. McGough","What I would add is that we've seen the promotional activity focused primarily in the premium segment. This is a portion of the category that has grown. As you know, we're well positioned in that category with Marie Callender, with a very strong brand. We're investing in A&P innovation, but going forward, we need to ensure that we're getting our fair share of that merchandising support. As you know, we're investing in this premium segment. We've just launched Bertolli premium meals, and we're very pleased with those results. So we are having a balanced approach, making sure that we have a compelling message. But we've got to make sure that we have competitive merchandising to sustain our business momentum.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","One follow-up for me. You made the comments that you expected inflation to come in better than expected. Can you dimensionalize that? What is your inflation expectation for the year and just some sense of -- I mean, it sounds pretty obvious that the pacing gets much better into the back half but, John, anything you can tell us there, I think, will be greatly helpful.","John F. Gehring","Yes, I think at this point, David, what I'd say is we're probably looking at inflation probably slightly under 2%. Net-net, we still do see inflation when we look at all of our components of cost, including conversion and T&W. What I would say is the material commodity piece of that has come down somewhat since the first part of the year. So that's where we're seeing the lift over the balance of the year. The other thing I would just add is we feel very good about how we're positioned with our commodities and our hedges, so we feel confident about the ability -- our ability to capture that benefit as the year progresses.","Operator","We'll move now to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 questions. One, related to Ralcorp and the revenue, sort of current revenue trends, I just want to make sure I understood it right. As you currently -- and what you've experienced so far this year is that you've gone through this organization change and trying to fill some of the boxes or some of the open slots. Have you not had full sales coverage with every account? First of all, is that an accurate way to describe it?","Gary M. Rodkin","Bryan, that clearly is not optimal yet. We've had limited coverage given the restructuring that Ralcorp did before the acquisition. What I can tell you is the integration is very much on target. The organizational leaders are now all in place. That's quite recent. The new team and the structure is getting settled, and it's working on getting the wiring right. There will be a big change in the way this business is run from the restructuring that we're doing. Ralcorp did a few months -- Ralcorp, a few months before our acquisition, clearly made some changes that have to be reversed, and it disrupted parts of the business. Our pricing, our customer facing and supply chain are going to markedly improve as we get some time in place, and we look forward to seeing the impact of that starting in the second half of '14. Importantly, cost synergies in F '14 and F '15 to '17 are all on track. And net-net, we expected some challenges here, but we're still on target for the $0.25 of accretion. So a little bit longer than we hoped it would be, but frankly, we're in this thing for the long haul. We're doing it the right way. We clearly see a light at the end of the tunnel.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess the second question, just in terms of the environment being more difficult in general and understanding the comments about what's happened in shelf-stable meals and what's happened in frozen, but I just want to make sure, are your comments about the environment being more difficult really just focused on those categories, or does it spread across, really, the private label business as well? I'm just trying to understand is -- aside from some of those transition items with Ralcorp, you're also just seeing it's generally a more difficult environment in the private label world.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. I would tell you that overall, I think we need to acknowledge that it's relatively sluggish in the industry. It certainly is more severe in particular categories. The net of the whole private label industry, not just us, but the net of the private label industry is still up. So we are addressing the specific issues customer by customer, category by category, and we will start to see this thing bend a little bit starting in Q2 but much more so in the second half of the year.","Operator","We'll move now to Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Gary, just one follow-up. I'm curious about the integration of Ralcorp. I understand the business has always had its ups and downs. It's a private label business. You're always trading -- you're always making that decision volume versus pricing, and I guess that's how I interpret it. But when you -- just interpreted some of the volatility here, but when you're talking about -- what kind of changes were made at Ralcorp that need to be reversed at this point? And what gives you, I guess, such confidence that you're on the track to doing it the right way as far as serving customers and optimizing that equation?","Paul T. Maass","Sure. This is Paul. I'll field that. I would use one word that really will make a big difference, and that is focus. And Gary hit on the organizational changes that were executed prior to the acquisition, but it really consolidated a big part of the portfolio under one general manager. And our diversity of products and categories, as well as the customer diversity, just really translates into a different org design that will enable far deeper focus. As Gary said, customer by customer, category by category, it's not a one-size-fits-all and breaking the business down into those business units to enable the focus, from our perspective, will have a significant impact and really help us in the customer execution. And we'd lost some of that. And I believe that the execution, not only from the customer facing but also the total operations, will improve as we get things set up and rolling forward.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I would just add, Jonathan, that we're really making a shift into a true operating company. Ralcorp did a great job, primarily focused on acquisitions. That was their focus. They acknowledge that. What we need to do is really turn this into an operating company. And all the steps that Paul talked about, particularly on the front-facing parts of the business, the general managers who run the P&Ls and the customer-facing sales force, those are going to be dramatic changes.","Paul T. Maass","What gives me confidence is the feedback we get from the customers. So we've had a -- executed a lot of customer meetings, very positive feedback. We have great capabilities, great products. As we intensify the focus, we'll see improved results.","Operator","We have a question now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Unknown Analyst","This is Scott Barber [ph] asking a question for Thilo. Just a question around the Lightlife transaction. Why did you decide to sell that business?","Gary M. Rodkin","Lightlife, frankly, we did not have enough focus on that particular segment. It was our only real entry into that part of the store, and we just couldn't provide the kind of focus on it. It's a nice business, a good equity, but better focus from a different company will help that business.","Operator","We have a question now from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question, Consumer Foods, your expectation to get to flat volume for the year requires a resumption of growth later this year. That's probably going to be met with some degree of skepticism by a lot of investors. So with that in context, do you have the flexibility to still deliver against your earnings number if that volume performance comes in light?","John F. Gehring","Jason, this is John. What I would tell you is as we look at the full year, certainly, as I mentioned, job one is strengthening the volume performance there. But to your specific question, I would tell you that given the fact that a lot of the profit growth in the second half, in particular, is not tied directly to that volume getting all the way back to par, if you will, I think we do have some flexibility to still land within our guidance, even if we were to fall a little bit short of that. So again, I think getting back to what I said, we don't need -- we certainly needed to improve it, but we're not basing our guidance on a heroic return of really significant growth.","Operator","We'll move now to Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Gary, Nielsen data, it's not always accurate, but it seems to suggest some of your frozen SKUs have seen their distribution points drop by fairly meaningful amounts lately. I'm just curious if you can talk a bit about what's happening there, whether it's your products, in particular, that may be getting deemphasized, maybe frozen entr\u00e9es as a whole, or maybe the data just really aren't reflective of what's happening out there. I'm just curious for your take on shelf space loss, and if that's happening, whether maybe further cuts are at risk. Just any color there would be helpful.","Gary M. Rodkin","Sure. I'll really start with Healthy Choice. We've made a decision, a strategic decision to build our line around our Caf\u00e9 Steamers segment. And we're going through a process now of proactively rationalizing some of our lower-velocity, lower-margin SKUs in our other entr\u00e9e segments, in particular. As a result, we are seeing declines in Healthy Choice. As we go through the year, we're going to have a stronger product range with higher margins and velocity, albeit on lower distribution. At the same time, we are building our distribution in the premium segment with our introduction of Bertolli. We're very pleased with the end market results that we've gotten today on our single-serve meals, our multi-serve meals and our desserts as well.","Operator","We'll move now to Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have 2 questions. I guess the first, we haven't really touched on it much, but on the commercial side, can you maybe be a bit more specific as to which customers, is it domestic or international, are you seeing maybe better QSR traffic to help out Lamb Weston as the year progresses and whether lower potato cost is going to help out that business? And then second, it seems like Post -- maybe this is difficult for you to answer, Gary, but it seems like Post is now making a push once again into private label with their cold cereal business. They made a pasta acquisition. I don't know if you can comment, but I would have assumed that maybe there would have been a non-compete agreement or something along those lines.","Paul T. Maass","Yes, this is Paul. I'll answer the question on Lamb Weston Commercial Foods. So the shift was really in foodservice distribution, and we're in the process of shifting business from that particular customer to other customers along relationships. So it's a process that we have to get through. I'm really pleased with the traction that we're getting with new partners in distribution. We will not rely just on that channel for achieving the volume growth back. We'll also get that from international growth, as well as growth with QSRs and other chain partners and customers.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Eric, we really can't comment on what others are doing. What I can tell you is that we have confidence that we can leverage our capabilities, and we will as we get more time on our belt on cereal and pasta. So we're confident there. But unfortunately, can't comment on what the other guys are doing.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the consumer environment. I know you've talked about it a little bit here. But what do you think is going on with the consumer? I mean, do you think it's overall, they're spending less on food, or are they trading down? If you can just help understand how you're seeing that dynamic. Because there's some conflicting evidence from some of the results that are being reported. Would love to get your thoughts on that.","Gary M. Rodkin","Sure. I think we believe, clearly, that there's a real bifurcation in the marketplace. And you can see that with the big majority of folks, call it the 80-20 rule, they're still really squeezing very hard on the basics. I've talked about this before, how that isn't just food, but all basics. You can see them in the food industry really trying to manage their yield by using all their leftovers and by their just-in-time inventory not stocking up a lot. And those behaviors are continuing. It's really all about price value in this environment. We believe we have a portfolio that works well there. But we certainly have to take some actions to enable us to continue to drive that price value, and that means that we need to do some things in our cost structure to take it to a place where we can deliver that kind of value. And one of the things we talked about in the near term is shifting some of that advertising into more promotion and merchandising, again, within financial constraints. So I would say we are acknowledging that there's not a lot of tailwinds from the consumer. On the other hand, this is a very, very large industry, and we're going to try and get some share back.","Operator","We'll move now to Sanford Bernstein's Alexia Howard.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just coming back to the frozen segment, I get the point that getting your fair share of merchandising should help out in the near term. But the underlying structural issue is really the consumer demand for frozen having been quite weak for a number of years now, and it's obviously exacerbated by the moderation in commodity pressures leading to this step-up in merchandising activity. How much do you know about where the consumer is going out of frozen? Are they cooking from scratch? Are they moving to chilled prepared meals? Are they maybe just focusing on premium frozen? And what it's going to take to bring them back?","Thomas M. McGough","The frozen single-serve meal category is one in which volume's been relatively weak. It's been focused primarily in the better-for-you segment. There's a couple dynamics going on there. Certainly, over the last several years, that segment is driven by that carried-lunch occasion. And with the relatively weak labor environment, there's been an erosion of usage as a result of that. We also see that there's a migration to those things that are perceived to be fresher. And frozen food is an incredibly, from a product standpoint, fresh product, with the perception around the perimeter of the store and maybe outside the store, there are fresher alternatives. So that's an area that we're tackling on our businesses and one that we have to better position in order for the category to -- for that segment to grow.","Gary M. Rodkin","Alexia, just to amplify that last point, it's incumbent upon us in the frozen industry to convince folks of the value of the frozen meal. As Tom said, if you went into one of our plants, you'd see that it's just a giant kitchen and the food is really good quality, good nutrition, very good value. We need this to take some of the stigma away from the process side of this, and that's work that we're -- is ongoing.","Operator","And we have a question now from Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If I look at your stock's valuation multiple, it would seem to me that the market's not giving you much credit, Gary, for the $300 million of synergies that you think the Ralcorp business can deliver. And you've said that you're on track and you've got the leadership lined up the way you want, but I'm just wondering if you could just give us some more specifics about the cadence of how quickly those synergies can be realized and what comes first. Is it in the supply chain? Is it procurement? Is it overhead reductions? Maybe just a little more color would help people get more confident that it'll start coming quickly.","John F. Gehring","Yes, Robert, this is John. So I think I'll try to tackle a couple of pieces of that. First of all, I think the first savings we're seeing, and this will be very logical, would be just around some of the SG&A, and we've made great progress on the duplications and streamlining those common functions. So we're seeing that already, and that would make sense that that'd be the first thing we see. The biggest chunk of the savings is clearly going to be on the supply chain side. And I'm speaking strictly cost savings here when we talk about the $300 million. What I would tell you is clearly, we feel like we've got a really good pipeline of ideas and projects that we're working there. And there are things that we are actually implementing as I speak. The one thing I just -- the one thing that's important to remember on cost of goods sold synergies is that you have to identify the project, you have to implement the project, the cost savings then show up in inventory and eventually, they show up in the P&L when they sell through. So that's why a number of -- a good part of the COGS synergies we've identified for this year will show up in the back half. As we get into future years, we really expect a significant ramp-up in the cost of goods sold. And really, it's going to come, first and foremost, from procurement because we have significant overlap in terms of the commodities that both of our businesses buy, and the scale that we're able to bring to the marketplace will be very impactful there. So that's probably the biggest chunk. After that, we also think -- and these will take a little bit more time, but in order -- we also think there's great opportunities around transportation and warehousing that will not only be a cost advantage, but we also think it'll be an advantage with our customers when we can ship products together. Now that, obviously, will take more time because there's some infrastructure investments required there. And then lastly, along the same lines in terms of timeline, would be what we would just classify as network optimization. And I talk -- there, I'm talking about our manufacturing footprint. And so we've got 2 very large manufacturing footprints between our 2 companies, and we think there's a lot of opportunity, over time, to streamline that footprint, which will certainly take fixed costs out of the equation but will also help us in some of our variable costs. So there's a number of components there, but the summary I'd give you is the SG&A is already showing up. We'll see it. We're starting to see some of the early cost of goods sold, principally procurement matters. And the ramp-up in the back years is really going to be driven because we'll have all 3 of those levers in the supply chain working at once.","Operator","And we have a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicholas.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I had 2 questions for you. The first one would be in terms of the Consumer Foods division, I guess I'm still confused on the second quarter performance for that business, which is implied to be down again in the quarter. And I guess, Gary, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the costs associated with the new products and how those were a drag in the quarter, which I understand. I guess what happens then in Q2? Is it just the residual weakness in volume? And I guess related to that, is it the promotional spending that's picking up where you're not expecting an immediate movement in volume on that spending?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Chris, fair question. I would tell you that it takes some time to implement these things we're talking about, and we will start to see some stabilization in the volume as we get later into the quarter, the latter part of the quarter. But I want to assure everybody that we're not burning the furniture for better optics, that we're trying and admitting that it takes a bit of time to do it right, and that's why we really don't see the real significant improvement until the second half.","Operator","Our last question comes from Greg Hessler with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I wanted to ask on -- just given the first quarter results and a little bit -- or the small reduction in guidance, is liability management something that you guys would consider with regards to your capital structure? You have some high coupon debt out there, and with the move in treasuries, it maybe makes it a little bit more palatable to take some of this debt out. Is that something that you guys would consider in order to lower your interest expense?","John F. Gehring","Yes, Greg, this is John. Certainly, we have -- we are continuously looking at our debt repayment strategy as we -- especially as we plan for things like the additional proceeds from Ardent Mills. What I would tell you is we are certainly watching the interest rate environment very carefully. We are -- we will be evaluating a number of options in terms of how we want to repay that debt. But we also -- to Gary's point, we don't want to burn the furniture from the standpoint of we don't want to just run and take out a whole bunch of our -- what we think is very low-cost, long-term debt. So we're going to have a very balanced approach. But I will also tell you we're not counting on that as an opportunity to save the back half of the year by really getting overly aggressive on an overly heavily weighted repayment strategy.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Yes, thank you. Well, before we wrap up the call, Gary would like to offer a few thoughts.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks. First, I want to thank everybody for your questions. I think every one of them was fair. I am the first to admit and take accountability for the fact that we had a bad quarter. We're not just hoping things are going to get better. We're taking actions. I want to assure you, as I just said, that we're not burning the furniture. We're going to do it right, and that's why we're going to see most of the impact in the second half. We're in it for the long haul, and we believe very deeply in our strategy. But as we talked about, as responsible stewards of the business, we need to course-correct when the marketplace environment is clearly telling us to.","We know that job one is stabilizing our Consumer Foods business by rebuilding the volume. Price value is more important than ever before, and we need to get back our share of quality merchandising and our market share. This environment's requiring us to be more cost-conscious across the whole company so that we can deliver that value. This includes raising the bar and being more selective on where we spend our resources, including our marketing dollars. Number two, we're very confident in our private brand strategy. It's a growth business. We're working hard to get ourselves in position to really drive that growth by leveraging our new operating organization, scale and our CPG capabilities. It's taking some time to rebuild and rewire this organization, but it's coming together well, and we can, as I said before, see a light at end of the tunnel. In the near term, we are delivering on our cost synergies, as you just heard from John.","And number three, we've got a strong commercial business led by Lamb Weston. Yes, we did have and do have a short-term bump with a key customer, but this is a big-scale, high-market share, global footprint business that will continue to grow and deliver us strong returns. So net-net, we have our sights on the long-term algorithm and on delivering the committed second half EPS growth for all the reasons that John and I talked about. Thanks for your attention.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you, Gary. And just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web, as detailed in our news release.

And welcome to the Conagra Brands Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney. Please go ahead.","Brian Kearney","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.","I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements during today's call. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. Descriptions of risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales growth, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items.","The reconciliations of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in either the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, Conagrabrands.com. Finally, we will be making references to total Conagra Brands as well as Legacy Conagra Brands. References to Legacy Conagra Brands refer to measures that exclude any income or expenses associated with the recently acquired Pinnacle Foods business.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings conference call.","We have a lot discuss. So, let\u2019s start with what I want you to take away from today. First, we remain confident that we will deliver long-term value by continuing to implement the Conagra Way to profitable growth. Our unwavering commitment to the Conagra Way will serve both, legacy Conagra and Pinnacle well into the future.","Fiscal 2019 was a year of remarkable transition. We did a major deal that required more attention than originally anticipated, but I\u2019m pleased to report that we continue to make progress stabilizing the Pinnacle business. We\u2019ve hit several key integration milestones and our deleveraging initiative is on track.","As you saw in our release this morning, our Q4 results were disappointing. This was largely due to discrete issues on a few businesses as a result of non-economic behavior from competitors as well as unfavorable market conditions for our Ardent Mills joint venture. These issues accelerated late in the quarter and we see them as transitory headwinds.","Now, I'm going to unpack the drivers of our Q4 performance in a moment, but before I do, I want to comment on the year, because fiscal 2019 -- in fiscal 2019, we took several very important steps, both organic and inorganic to enhance the long-term health of our business. These will help us play offense in fiscal 2020 as we bring to market another robust slate of on-trend innovation. That innovation is also a major factor in reiterating our earnings guidance and increasing our organic growth guidance for fiscal 2020. Dave will provide more guidance information later.","I\u2019ll wrap up by sharing some thoughts on our opportunities within plant-based meat-alternatives. Now that we own Gardein, we are very well positioned to capitalize on the explosive growth in this exciting space.","So, before I jump into the details of the quarter, I want to frame up the big picture. Fiscal 2019 was transformative for us and we made very good progress securing our foundation during the year. We significantly advanced the Conagra Way playbook by deploying our principles across the portfolio. Our principals dictate that it\u2019s important to be lean, so you can be agile but that you can\u2019t cut your way to prosperity. Growth is essential and not all growth is equal. The consumer has to be top of mind and innovation capability counts.","Fiscal 2019 also brought the launch of our largest innovation slate to-date along with an emphasis on supporting our brands with efficient marketing programs. As a result, you can see, we\u2019ve had sustained consumption growth over the past two years. We also delivered organic net sales growth for the second year in a row. Our disciplined approach to innovation and brand building, particularly across our frozen and snacking portfolios is paying off. The result has provided us with a rock solid foundation from which to deliver on our new, long-term growth algorithm.","Our successful completion of the Pinnacle Foods acquisition during the year accelerated the next wave of change at Conagra. Pinnacle was an obvious fit that increased our scale, enhanced our frozen platform, and added leading iconic brands in attractive categories. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress integrating the businesses, realizing synergies and positioning Pinnacle\u2019s Big Three brands for a return to growth.","We also continued to reshape our overall portfolio for better growth and better margins during fiscal \u201819 by divesting non-core assets.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Pinnacle business. Starting with the integration on slide nine, we achieved a critical milestone at the end of the fiscal year. We successfully transitioned Pinnacle\u2019s legacy order-to-cash and financial ERP systems on to Conagra\u2019s SAP platform. This took a tremendous effort by the integration team and it went off without a hitch. In fact, across the board, the integration continues to run smoothly, and our synergy capture remains on schedule. Since the transaction closed in late October, we have recognized $31 million of synergies.","From a balance sheet perspective, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track with our deleveraging plan, having reduced debt by $450 million in the fourth quarter and $886 million from the close of the acquisition through the end of the fiscal year. We remain fully committed to achieving our goal of a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 3.6 to 3.5 times in fiscal 2021 and maintaining a solid investment grade credit rating.","Turning to business performance. The Legacy Pinnacle business came in at the high end of our net sales guidance, and operating profit expectations in the quarter. I'm very happy to report that Big Three brands, Birds Eye, Wish-Bone and Duncan Hines all progressed toward stabilization in Q4. We've begun to implement our value-over-volume playbook with the Pinnacle portfolio, and overall, we feel good about our progress just seven months after closing this major strategic acquisition.","As expected, the implementation of our value-over-volume approach resulted in short-term sales declines as we pruned the low performing SKUs to clear the decks for our new innovations. The good news is that the products in the market are performing well. The increase in base sales velocities, as shown in the graphic on the right demonstrate that our approach is working. We're building a stronger base on which to layer new innovations coming to the market later this year.","Let's move on to the Legacy Conagra business. While we\u2019re confident in our long-term trajectory and that fiscal 2019 overall positions us well for the future, our financial results for Q4 did not meet our expectations. Our Q4 results were hampered by several unique items, each of which we will unpack for you today.","Q4 organic net sales growth in the Legacy Conagra business missed our guidance by 240 basis points, which equates to about $43 million. The unexpected items that drove this shortfall included negative impacts of intensified promotional competition in our Hunt\u2019s, Chef Boyardee and Marie Callender's businesses. This drove about three-fourth of our sales miss this quarter. We view this as a transitory renting of market share that happens from time to time. We are not going to let these near-term events disrupt our disciplined approach to brand building.","We also experienced some unexpected manufacturing and co-packer related challenges in the quarter. These issues were one-off in nature and have been addressed. Our EPS miss was primarily due to these items combined with weak performance in our Ardent Mills joint venture during the quarter, driven by lower than expected wheat prices and a lack of market volatility.","Let's take a closer look at how this merchandising dynamic affected our Marie Callender's brand. Fiscal \u201819 was an important year for Marie Callender's as we undertook significant changes to modernize the brand and improve profitability. These changes included adding modern attributes and flavor profiles with simplified, higher quality ingredients, transitioning from trays to bowls, rightsizing portions and optimizing lower performing SKUs. As a result of these changes, the underlying brand health is far better, and our new Marie Callender's items have significantly higher velocities than the meals they replaced. Unfortunately, some of our competitors took a different approach in recent months and prioritized short-term growth via heavy promotion.","Slide 14 highlights one example, where our competitor's product was discounted to drive significant incremental or promoted growth. As we move through the fourth quarter, our competition became more aggressive on price and displaced some of the very valuable merchandising support that we had anticipated for Marie Callender's. We don't believe that the short-term renting of our market share is a sustainable way to compete. We\u2019ll stay true to the Conagra Way playbook and our principled approach. Holding fast to principles can be difficult, especially when competitors are making different choices and heading down a path that could be viewed as profitless prosperity. We will not adopt a volume over value approach here and will not return to the old habit that we worked so hard to eradicate. But, we may from time to time take short-term actions to protect our share as we look to continue to build for the long term.","We also experienced some unanticipated effects of our disciplined approach to pricing in our grocery portfolio. As you can see on slide 15, the cost of steel cans increased 14% year-over-year. As we took inflation justified pricing on Hunt's and Chef Boyardee to partially offset the increased cost, we experienced higher than expected volume declines. In our Hunt\u2019s canned tomato business, our pricing actions translated to shelf price increases. Last quarter, we said that we saw a competition announcing price increases and you can see that reflected in the all other increase of 4.5%. But, what we did not anticipate is that private label would stay flat and in some instances actually decrease price. By the end of the quarter, price gaps were simply too wide for consumers to ignore and we lost volume.","Similarly, on Chef Boyardee, we took price increases throughout the year. In Q4, the elasticity impacts of these increases were exacerbated by a decrease in merchandising support that was beyond our expectations. Each of these brands, Marie Callender's, Hunt\u2019s and Chef Boyardee has a leadership role in its respective category. When on-shelf price gaps grow too wide or merchandising becomes uncompetitive, volume can be impacted quickly and significantly in the short-term windows and that was the case in Q4.","In response, we will not change our principles. We continue to believe that profitable growth is key. And historically, aggressive pricing actions have proven to be unsustainable. But, we will remain agile in the face of hyper-promotional behavior by the competition and we\u2019ll tactical defend our share where it makes sense.","Our second transitory factor that impacted us in Q4 was manufacturing and co-packer issues. P.F. Chang\u2019s, Duke\u2019s, and Peter Pan were affected by isolated production challenges during the quarter. Importantly, we are confident that we have the right resources in place to manage food safety and quality issues across the enterprise. Root cause for each of these issues has been identified and properly addressed and the related customer service disruptions have been corrected and restored.","Finally, our Q4 EPS was also impacted by weakness in the Ardent Mills joint venture. Ardent Mills profit eroded during the quarter, lower than anticipated wheat prices and reduced volatility in the wheat markets negatively impacted Ardent\u2019s results.","Q4 presented a variety of headwinds to navigate. Ultimately our results did not meet our expectations. But, we were not thrown off course. While we had our challenges, there were also clear signs of continued progress during the quarter. With respect to our Legacy Conagra business, Q4 saw a continuation of the strong performance in our snacks business and positive results from frozen single-serve meals that we have talked about all year. We also delivered solid performance in our international and foodservice segments during the quarter.","Finally, we over-delivered on our free cash flow target for the year and remain on track with our deleveraging goals. Dave will add more detail on our strong cash flow during his remarks.","Slide 19 shows the continued growth in total sales and average weekly TPDs in our frozen single-serve meals portfolio. Notably, in Q4, we lapped the 13% growth we delivered in Q4 fiscal 2018, which was one of the best quarters we've ever had in frozen single-serve meals. We still delivered nearly 6% growth on top of that this quarter. So, as we look at the continuing trends in our sales in this key category as well as the trends in TPEs, we're very pleased with our progress.","Our approach is not only having a positive impact on our results, it's also driving overall category growth in frozen single-serve meals. Our competition is aware of this growth, and they certainly want in on the action. We believe it's part of why we're seeing some of the unsustainable promotional activity.","Our strategy is not driven by price, but a rigorous approach to modernizing and premiumizing our brand through renovation and innovation. You can see on slide 21 that our innovation is driving growth and performing far better than that of our key competitors.","Let's turn to our snacks business, which continues to exceed our expectations. Slide 22 details the growth we delivered in Q4, which included contributions from every key snacking vertical, popcorn, meat snacks, sweet treats, and seeds. Overall, retail dollar sales in our Legacy Conagra snacking portfolio grew 12.6% on a two-year basis in the fourth quarter. You can see a sustained improvement in our performance, following last year's NACS show where we unveiled our new approach to snacks.","Our international segment performed extremely well throughout fiscal \u201819 and in the fourth quarter in particular. These strong results have been driven by our successful efforts to reinvent frozen meals in Canada, drive snacks growth in Mexico, modernize iconic brands internationally and implement our value-over-volume strategy to realize the power of our strong brand equities. The continued execution of our value-over-volume strategy also benefited our foodservice segment in the quarter. We're continuing to build a higher quality revenue base in our foodservice segment and accomplishing considerable margin expansion.","I next want to spend some time previewing our robust innovation slate for fiscal 2020. Slide 26 shows just some of the frozen innovation we have in store for this year. Yet again, we\u2019ll be delivering products with modern brand attributes, simplified labels and ingredients and bold flavor profiles.","Retailers have responded very well to these products, some of which will start shipping soon. We expect to see these products reaching the marketplace in the first half of fiscal 2020 and hitting their full stride in the second half. We have plans to continue to build upon our snacking success in fiscal 2020 with the launch of our strongest line-up of snacking innovation to-date. That includes these provocative new meat snacks with bold flavors, new forms and optimized price pack architecture.","We\u2019re also launching our salty snacks into neglected and growing coves of the market, where we can extend our brands through innovation. We are reframing our sweet treats brands to unlock significant growing demand spaces that meet modern trends. We're reinvigorating snack pack and reaching out to Hispanic audiences with products like the co-branded Fanta jells you see here. With this innovation, we clearly have confidence that our snacking portfolio will maintain its momentum in fiscal 2020.","We also have big plans for the Pinnacle portfolio. You can see some of those upcoming innovations on slide 30. We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to contemporize our newly acquired leadership brands to capitalize on key growth targets.","One area of the Pinnacle portfolio where we now see far greater growth and innovation opportunities than previously forecast is the Gardein brand. I'm sure you've seen all the recent attention on the plant-based meat-alternative space. We think there's no brand that better illustrates the enormous long-term opportunity ahead than Gardein, a real jewel in the portfolio that we haven't spent a lot of time talking to you about or capitalizing on in market.","Gardein has a solid presence in foodservice and a leadership role in plant-based meat-alternatives at retail. Here's how we're thinking about this exciting, high-growth space between now and fiscal 2022. We start by sizing the total opportunity. Based on our analysis of product substitution in other categories, almond milk for cow's milk as an example, we can reasonably predict the opportunity for plant-based meat-alternatives. And here's where it gets really exciting. Because the opportunity shouldn't be viewed as just a percentage of fresh meat, we think the opportunity is a percentage of all foods that contain meat. Based on this view, our analysis shows that plant-based meat-alternatives could achieve a 15% share of both of these market segments. That means the opportunity here could be in the range of $30 billion, just in the U.S. And you know, there's even more opportunity internationally.","So, the financials are compelling. I think, many of you may be surprised by the numbers on slide 33, showing just how large the Gardein brand is already. It has quadrupled in size over the past four years, and is now the second largest brand in the meat-alternative space with annual sales of more than $170 million at retail and across foodservice channels. Importantly, we will be well-positioned to support continued growth because we have new capacity coming on line in the coming months. These expanded resources are already well underway, and we expect them to be operational in the fall of 2019. And we anticipate that capacity will be used to produce more than just burgers. While plant-based burgers are getting a lot of press these days, it's instructive to take a step back and look at what's really going on in meat consumption.","Slide 35 outlines overall consumption of animal proteins. The numbers to the right of the bars demonstrate the average annual number of meals eaten per person by type of animal proteins. As you can see, burgers are important, but this market extends well beyond beef patties or even beef. Chicken is by far the most popular animal protein in the U.S., both in home and away from home. I would also highlight the significant consumption of pork, hotdogs and fish. Importantly, eating occasions for animal proteins cover all day parts. Our view is that the relative size of animal protein consumption serves as a useful guide for how to think about the market opportunity for plant-based alternatives. And if you're wondering whether chicken eaters are really interested in trying plant-based alternatives, the answer is clearly yes.","Slide 36 focuses just on the plant-based meat alternative space within the retail channel. As you can see here, plant-based alternatives to beef are the largest protein alternative today, driven by the fact that products like veggie burgers have been available at retail for a long time. However, alternatives to chicken have built a substantial beachhead, and this space is the fastest growing plant-based alternative by far.","We believe that over the next several years, Gardein is extremely well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid growth of plant-based meat-alternatives. The brand already provides a diversified portfolio of products, particularly in the under-appreciated alternative to chicken segment. And if there\u2019s a segment of the meat space that consumers care about, there\u2019s a good chance that Gardein is already there or will be soon with a deliciously meat-free product. This includes offerings across all day parts.","We\u2019re also going to expand Gardein\u2019s reach. Gardein is well established and well known but we see plenty of opportunities to grow this brand. First up is an improved burger. Gardein\u2019s current burger platform is underdeveloped. And we are in a process of creating a next generation of beefless burger to better compete in this popular segment. As we do this, we expect accelerated growth at retail and in foodservice. But, we also plan to compete across the important hotdog and sausage categories.","We believe the winner in each of these categories will have the best taste, appearance and aroma, which is what we\u2019re focusing on delivering across our plant-based alternative portfolio. What we believe Conagra can do better than anyone else is leverage iconic brands, superior culinary capabilities, and proven innovation muscle to reach consumers across multiple categories in plant-based protein.","During our Investor Day, you heard me talk about a key tenet of the Conagra Way to profitable growth. Iconic brands, plus modern attributes equals superior velocities, and that formula is perfect for this space. Across foodservice and retail channels of trade, we believe that Conagra Brands, leveraging and co-branded with Gardein is ideally positioned. We have the best culinary capability, differentiated packaging, and the broadest portfolio of power brands to leverage. Gardein contributes the modern benefit. Overall, we\u2019re excited about the opportunities in plant-based meat-alternatives. This together with our entire innovation pipeline will help us reach our long-term algorithm.","Looking ahead, we remain confident that we\u2019ll continue to deliver quality long-term growth at Conagra by implementing the Conagra Way and prioritizing value-over-volume. We will continue to introduce on-trend innovation to the marketplace; we\u2019ll also continue to execute our Pinnacle action plan including leveraging the Gardein brand to tap into the plant-based meat-alternative opportunity. We expect the market will continue to be highly dynamic. We will need to stay both principle-based and agile as we remain committed to delivering our guidance and navigate a dynamic marketplace. But notwithstanding a difficult Q4, we\u2019re confident that we will meet our fiscal 2020 guidance and deliver on our long-term goals.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dave.","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone.","This morning, I\u2019ll walk through Q4 and fiscal year 2019 for both the Legacy Conagra and Pinnacle businesses before we open it up for questions.","Slide 42 outlines our performance for the quarter and the full fiscal year. I\u2019ll walk through more detail in a moment but I\u2019ll start here by hitting the key points. Compared to the year-ago period, net sales for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year were up 32.9% and 20.2%, respectively, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods. Organic net sales excluding Trenton were down 0.7% for the quarter. While the quarter did not come in as we expected, we believe the issues in the quarter are transitory, as Sean discussed, and do not impact our fiscal year \u201820 guidance or long-term algorithm. Despite the Q4 challenges, we delivered organic net sales growth of 0.3% for the fiscal year, which is above last year's organic growth rate.","Adjusted operating profit was up 25.7% in the fourth quarter and up 23.4% for the full year. These increases are primarily driven by the inclusion of Pinnacle's profit.","A few points on margins. Our fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 13.2% and full year was 15.4%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year, and above our guidance range. While adjusted gross margin decreased for the full year, adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points. This relationship reflects the gross margin impact of our ongoing shift of marketing investments from A&P to above-the-line retailer marketing, as well as leverage at the SG&A line where we have benefited from our commitment to a lean operating environment and Pinnacle synergies.","For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 22.2% versus the previous year, while full fiscal year adjusted EBITDA rose 16.7% to approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting the inclusion of approximately seven months of Pinnacle's results. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.36 for the quarter, down 28% from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.01, down 4.7% as the Q4 transitory items and the shortfall in Ardent Mills negatively impacted our performance versus expectations.","Slide 43 outlines the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year net sales changes versus the same periods a year ago. It should be noted that for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year, we saw improvements in price mix, even after taking into account our increases in retailer investments to support brand building. Slide 44 provides a summary of net sales by segment for the quarter and fiscal year 2019.","For the quarter, grocery and snacks net sales and organic net sales declined 7.1% and 2.5% respectively, as the divestiture of the Wesson oil business subtracted 460 basis points from the net sales growth rate. Despite continued strong end-market performance by our snacking businesses, net sales were impacted by the Q4 transitory items Sean discussed. For the full fiscal year, grocery and snacks organic net sales remained largely in line with the prior year.","The refrigerated and frozen segment continued to benefit from innovation during Q4 across multiple brands, including Banquet, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's and Reddi-wip. However, these benefits were more than offset by lower-than-expected merchandising support on Marie Callender's, the P.F. Chang\u2019s manufacturing challenges that resulted in a recall and to a lesser extent, continued declines in certain refrigerated businesses. These headwinds led to a decrease in reported and organic net sales in Q4. For the full year however, the segment reported good growth, with net sales and organic net sales of 1.9% and 0.9%, respectively.","As Sean mentioned, the implementation of our Conagra playbook led to improved results in international for the quarter and full year. The segment\u2019s fourth quarter reported numbers were impacted by the divestitures of the Canadian Del Monte business and Wesson oil business, which combined to reduce the net sales growth rate by approximately 10.2%. The segment was also negatively impacted 2.8% by foreign exchange.","Notwithstanding these factors, international\u2019s organic net sales were up 5.6% for the quarter, and up 3.7% for the full-year. For the quarter, the foodservice segment\u2019s reported and organic net sales were down 12.6% and 0.6%, respectively. The sale of the Trenton facility and divestiture of the Wesson oil business reduced the net sales growth rate by 12% in the aggregate. The segment\u2019s Q4 organic net sales results reflect continued execution of our value-over-volume strategy and the impact of inflation justified pricing. Volume declined 5.9% in the quarter, but price mix increased 5.3%. Organic net sales were down 2.7% for the full year. Pinnacle sales for the quarter and full fiscal year were $756 million and $1.7 billion respectively, in line with our expectations for the quarter and full year. ","Slide 45 outlines the puts and takes on our Q4 and full year adjusted gross margin versus the prior year. It's important to keep in mind that for Q4, the 1% benefit you see on the left side of the page includes a headwind of approximately 50 basis points related to the isolated manufacturing challenges and recalls we experienced during the quarter.","Moving to slide 46, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit decreased 9.2% during the quarter, and Legacy Conagra\u2019s adjusted operating margin was 13.4%. Total adjusted operating profit including Pinnacle increased 25.7% in Q4.","In the grocery and snacks segment, adjusted operating profit was down in Q4 due to the loss of profit associated with the divestiture of the Wesson oil business, as well as higher transportation and packaging costs, primarily in metal packaging. The grocery and snacks segment was also negatively impacted by the manufacturing challenges we faced in the quarter.","The refrigerated and frozen segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit decreased 6.1% in Q4. Realized productivity improvements were offset by lower net sales, in part due to the manufacturing and merchandising impacts we discussed earlier, as well as higher transportation and input costs.","The foodservice segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit increased 4% in Q4, while operating margin expanded to 12.2%, due to the impacts of favorable price mix, supply chain realized productivity and the sale of the lower margin business produced in our Trenton facility. Pinnacle\u2019s adjusted operating profit, including the corporate expense related to Pinnacle, totaled $95 million for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, in line with our expectations.","On slide 47, you can see that Legacy Conagra adjusted operating profit increased 1.2% for the full year and Legacy Conagra\u2019s adjusted operating margin increased by 43 basis points to 15.4%. The Pinnacle segment\u2019s adjusted operating profit totaled $264 million and adjusted operating margin was 15.3%, above our fiscal year \u201819 guidance range of 14.6% to 14.9%. Total Conagra adjusted operating profit was up 23.4% versus a year ago and adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, above our fiscal year \u201819 guidance range of 14.9% to 15.2%.","Slide 48 outlines the drivers of our adjusted EPS decrease versus Q4 a year ago. As you can see, Legacy Conagra adjusted EPS decreased $0.07, approximately $0.02 of this decline was from divested businesses, $0.02 was from the manufacturing challenges discussed, $0.02 was from a larger than expected decline in Ardent Mills and $0.02 was from lower pension and postretirement service income resulting from fully funding the pension plan in fiscal \u201818, which we have now wrapped as we head into fiscal \u201820. The Pinnacle acquisition reduced total company adjusted EPS by $0.07 during the quarter.","Slide 49 outlines the drivers of our 4.7% decrease in full year adjusted EPS versus a year ago. Adjusted EPS for Legacy Conagra increased $0.04 for the year, despite $0.08 of headwinds from the reduced pension retirement service income I just mentioned, and $0.06 of headwinds Ardent Mills. The Pinnacle acquisition reduced total company adjusted EPS by $0.14 for fiscal 2019.","Slide 50 summarizes net debt and cash flow information and demonstrates the clear progress we continue to make in enhancing our overall financial position this year. Overall, we remain on schedule with our fiscal \u201821 target of a net debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratios of 3.6 to 3.5 times.","Between the close of the Pinnacle acquisition in Q2, and fiscal year end, we reduced total debt by $886 million. And our estimated ratio for pro forma net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.88 times as of the end of fiscal \u201819. For the full fiscal year, Conagra generated $761 million of free cash flow, exceeding our guidance of $700 million. As we consistently state, we are committed to solid investment grade credit ratings.","As noted in our release, we are essentially reaffirming our fiscal \u201820 EPS guidance this morning. On slide 51, you can see that we've reduced our estimated fiscal \u201820 earnings by $0.02, solely to remove the historical profits contributions from the now divested Gelit business. Excluding the adjustment for Gelit, our earnings guidance range has not changed from what we provided at the Company's Investor Day in April 2019.","And slide 52 outlines our fiscal 2020 outlook across all metrics. We are updating our organic net sales guidance to be in the range of 1% to 1.5%, compared to our prior expectation of approximately 1% provided at Investor Day. Note that this growth rate excludes the impact of the fiscal \u201820\u2019s 53rd week. All other metrics on this slide include the impact of the 53rd week. We expect adjusted operating margin to improve to a range of 16.2% to 16.8% in fiscal \u201820 as we continue the integration of Pinnacle to generate estimated synergies while implementing the Conagra way playbook. Also, we expect free cash flow to continue to improve in fiscal \u201820, benefiting from the expected Pinnacle cost synergies and the expected increase in organic net sales.","We expect free cash flow to reach approximately $1 billion for fiscal \u201820. Importantly, we also remain committed to the long-term algorithm we provided at our Investor Day. As our financial progress accelerates through fiscal year \u201822 and we benefit from the full synergy opportunity of the Pinnacle acquisition, we look to capitalize on new sources of growth, like the Gardein opportunity Sean highlighted earlier.","To conclude my formal remarks today, I\u2019d like to turn to slide 53. Here, I\u2019d summarize the more important planning assumptions that underpin our fiscal year \u201820 guidance. These can be broken into two buckets, organic growth and margins. Overall, we see results being more heavily weighted towards the second half of fiscal \u201820. With respect to our organic net sales growth, we anticipate higher innovation-related investment during the first half fiscal \u201820 with the related sales growth weighted towards the second half as our distribution, trial and repeat builds throughout the year. We also expect the highly promotional environment in select categories that we experienced in Q4 to continue in the near term. As Sean mentioned, we have seen these situations before and will remain agile in how we respond to competition.","Consistent with what we\u2019ve been saying since December, we continue to expect Legacy Pinnacle sales trends to improve in the second half of fiscal \u201820. We also expect margins to improve during the second half of fiscal \u201820 as the innovation-related investment will be higher in the first half, as I just mentioned. And for Pinnacle, by the second half of fiscal \u201820, we expect to lap the elevated input cost inflation in transportation and crops that the business had been experiencing. We also expect synergies to increase as we move through the course of the year. Finally, we expect Pinnacle will continue to be dilutive to our year-over-year gross margin until we anniversary the acquisition in late October.","Thank you for listening. That concludes my remarks. I\u2019ll now pass it to the operator as Sean, Tom McGough, Darren Serrao and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for the question.","Sean Connolly","Good morning.","Andrew Lazar","I guess, sort of a two-parter here. Given the top-line challenges experienced in fiscal \u201819, some of the inventory reductions, some of the merchandising and competitive challenges that you noted today that are expected to continue at least in the near term, some elasticity. And I guess, the question is, why raise the fiscal \u201820 top-line guidance range? And then, more broadly, with the Pinnacle deal, there is always some concern among investors that the Company could well lose some focus and momentum on its core or legacy business, as a result. And in light of the 4Q results, I guess how can investors have confidence that that\u2019s not the case in terms of what we\u2019re seeing play out more recently? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Let me take that in reverse order, Andrew, in terms of this, first, this notion of distraction. I can appreciate that that\u2019s an easy notion to grab on to but it\u2019s just not accurate. The issues we faced in Q4 literally had nothing to do with Pinnacle, which has been a highly efficient work stream for us. As I pointed out in my remarks a few minutes ago, they were mostly -- the Q4 issue is mostly about macro factors that were not assumed in our forecast, so things like non-economic decision by competitors, isolated recalls and Ardent Mills is an example. But each of these items, they were not expected, they did add up to the miss you saw in Q4, but they are transitory events that we do not expect to repeat, and that really is the story. But, if I step back, here is how I think about the big picture of the quarter and fiscal \u201820 in kind of one thought.","If you look at \u201819 as a whole, \u201819 undoubtedly was a year of remarkable transition for Conagra Brands. We did advance our innovation agenda. We did see continued traction in frozen meals and snacks. And we made a transformative acquisition that did end-up requiring more near-term fixes than we had expected. But we wrapped our arms around those very quickly and efficiently. Now, we've got that business stabilizing and on track in terms of integration.","Q4 clearly was disappointing, but the fact is, it was largely due to transitory issues. But now, we are in a position to play offense, and our innovation pipeline is both broad and full. So, despite the speed bump, we are clearly still advancing our playbook. And that's why in terms of fiscal \u201820, we feel very good about the top-line drivers we have in place. Our innovation pipeline is the best we\u2019ve had yet and as it works it way in the marketplace, really hits its stride in the second half, we're very confident that we will all like what we see. ","In terms of raising the high end of the sales guidance for fiscal \u201820, you can think about that as largely recovering the transitory volume losses we experienced at the end of this year, and doesn't hurt that we\u2019re beginning to see some improvement in our scanner data as well. Dave, do you want to build on that?","Dave Marberger","Yes. So, we haven't changed our estimate of net sales in fiscal \u201820 from where we were previously. So, because we missed Q4 driven by transitory reasons, we expect that business will come back. So, the fiscal \u201819 base is lower, but we're holding our estimate for fiscal \u201820 sales, so the math adds 50 basis points of growth, so we added that to the guidance.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Good morning. It seems that 1H \u201819, the first half will be a little bit worse than what you previously expected. And I'm saying that because you talked about the headwinds in the fourth quarter being late in the quarter. So, I assume they bleed into 1Q \u201820. But, you're maintaining your annual guidance. And I guess the implication is the back half of the year will have to be somewhat better than you initially anticipated or maybe you're thinking about the bottom half of guidance. I just am curious what's better in 2H \u201820, right, the second half, if anything than you initially modeled?","Sean Connolly","Ken, we\u2019re not going to guide for two quarters, obviously, but you\u2019ve got the shape of the curve right. As we said all along, H2 is going to be a stronger year or stronger half than H1. And obviously, now that Q4 came in light due to transitory issues, we expect recovery of that transitory loss next Q4.","In terms of the things like Q4 issues lingering into Q1 and does that mean a worse Q1, I wouldn't think about it that way. We've got a vast portfolio here. Things are always moving around. Some things will come in below what we initially anticipate. We manage a risk and opportunity approach to dealing with that, which means we look for other opportunities that offset things we didn't expect. So, today on the call I talked a little bit about Gardein, we\u2019ve got other things, the snacks obviously in the back half of this year exceeded our expectations. So, we've got a lot of that we feel really good about that probably has some upside to it on the year, and we\u2019ve got some other things like these near-term competitive dynamics that we've got to navigate. We\u2019ve got multiple ways we can do that. But, I think to your point, big picture is, really we haven't changed our cadence on the year. We're expecting our innovation to go into the marketplace in the first half, get its footing and really build momentum in the second half. And then on Pinnacle in particular, as we've talked before, getting those TPDs back that were lost last year, that should really start to kick in as we get to the middle part of the year and the back half of the year. Dave, do you want to add to that?","Dave Marberger","Yes. I\u2019d just add one thing. And I mentioned in my comments that we are increasing pretty significantly our investment for innovation and that hits in the first half relative to prior years. So that impacts not just profit, but net sales. So, that dynamic flows first half, second half as well.","Ken Goldman","Thank you, and then follow-up for me. I'm surprised, the competitor you talked about in frozen took some merchandising business from you. Do you have enough visibility from your customers as to when your competitors are going to promote like that, so that your merchandising isn't redundant with theirs? And I guess, the broader question is, isn\u2019t really this one of the risks of shifting marketing to promotions from advertising that you become more reliant on some of the wins of merchandising of what your competitors can do?","Sean Connolly","No. On that latter piece, the answer is no. Because as we talked before that to the degree we have moved below the line money, it's below the line money that wasn't doing anything. So, when you're moving money away, that\u2019s not doing anything, you're not taking anything away. And instead a lot of the spend as we\u2019ve talked many times, it covers a multitude of tools across a multitude of brands. Here on Marie, we\u2019re talking about one brand, and we're talking about a particular time of year where we count on some high quality merchandising that we got displaced from a very aggressive competitor. And what I would say is that it is very hard to anticipate those things. It is not the first time we have seen this in this industry. In fact, if you know Conagra\u2019s history, we know this move, as well as anybody, it\u2019s called volume over value, and it does happen from time to time. But it is not sustainable, because as we learned, when you put all your human and financial resources into price-based competition, there's very little left in the enterprise to actually study consumer behavior or design new quality innovation, and then market it in a personalized fashion. And what you're left with over time is a weak product line up and a consumer that is trained to buy a deal. And that's not our playbook. From time to time, we will encounter it and we got to deal with it. But that's really not what we're after. We'd rather follow our approach, stay consistently focused on moving the center line of our profitability and our sales north over time, even if we've got to deal with some standard deviation in any given quarter, based on this kind of behavior.","Ken Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Bryan Spillane","Good morning, everyone. Dave, I guess just wanted to get a little bit more color from you on gross profit, how we should be thinking about gross profits for \u201820. I think, talked a little bit about some investment in above the line in terms of supporting new products. But if you can just give us some sense of COGS inflation for fiscal \u201820, if there's any pricing contemplated to cover inflation, and just some of the other factors that might influence gross margins for 2020?","Sean Connolly","Yes. Bryan, let me try to unpeel that. So, overall, we have not given specific guidance on gross margin, we gave it on operating margin because of the dynamics. But to your question, generally speaking, inflation, right now there's a lot of moving pieces that the transportation inflation, we saw heavy in the first half of the year and \u201819 is moderated. Although now we're seeing increases in areas like proteins, and then there's obviously some of the weather related inflation that we're dealing with. But as we go into fiscal \u201820, we think given the overall mix of the portfolio and inflation, we're probably going to be close to where we finished this year, 2.7%, 2.8%, something in that area. We expect to continue to deliver on our realized productivity. And we do have pricing actions that we've taken this year that we\u2019ll roll into next year. And then, as inflation comes, and as you saw, we had a lot of inflation related to steel, and we took pricing to deal with that. As 20 develops and we see inflation and if it hits certain brands, we will plan on taking pricing where it\u2019s inflation justified. So, we just have to manage those dynamics as we go.","As it relates to the investments, I think, overall for the year, there's definitely going to be more of an increase in the innovation related investment in the first half and in the second half, although we will still have a healthy rate of investment, and year-on-year, it won't be up. So, that will be another kind of benefit to the second half.","So, overall, you put all those things together, there's puts and takes that kind of even out over the whole year for gross margin, but it's clearly more investment first half, more benefits second half. And then, there's synergies that come in as well. That's what\u2019s between G&A and cost of goods sold. So, as the year ramps up, the synergies will increase, and that will improve margins as well as we move into the second half.","Bryan Spillane","All right, thanks for that. And just I don't know if I missed it, but did you give guidance on capital spending for the year?","Sean Connolly","No, we did not, not in our remarks. We gave it on free cash flow. So, overall, free cash flow, we're still estimating approximately $1 billion in free cash flow.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning. Sean, just to kind of piggyback on Andrew Lazar\u2019s question, wanted to kind of understand a little bit of the glide path of the organic sales as they get better as we move throughout the year. Given where we started in Q4, should at least out of the gate in Q1, should we be definitionally positive for organic sales, just to kind of help investors understand the trajectory of the business? And then, I've got to follow-up.","Sean Connolly","Yes. Again, Steve, I don't want to give quarterly guidance here. It's not something that we typically like to do. We were in a position where we had to do it last year. And I didn't like that hack of a lot. I think what I can tell you is that this is kind of a first half, second half story. Obviously, as Dave pointed out, we've got some investments in the first half of the year, obviously that means in Q1 as well, because we've got new items coming in the marketplace that we will invest behind. We also are in the midst of doing some value-over-volume in particular on the Pinnacle business, as we clear the decks for our new innovation. So, in terms of the year, what we said before is that we expect the trend to bend as we move from the first half into the second half without giving kind of quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month specificity on the slopes of those curves. I think, we'd leave it at that in part because as we've said many times with respect to the Pinnacle TPDs, we are trying to accelerate where possible, getting some of these new innovations into the marketplace ahead of a normal plan a grant cadence. And that work as it has been going on, continues, especially when we get in some customers, some of these new innovations in there and can demonstrate that they're working and we've got traction. So, we'll stay flexible on that and continue to kind of update you should we see the trajectory changing. But that's how we see it right now.","Steve Strycula","Okay. And then, Dave, on the synergy piece, should we still think that about $150 million contribution in fiscal \u201820 is the right number with maybe a third to cogs, two-thirds to SG&A, is that the right way to kind of frame it for this year?","Dave Marberger","Yes. That\u2019s right, Steve. We had guided to, by the end of fiscal \u201820 will be about 55% of our synergy realized and we\u2019re still $285 million of total synergy, and the split between SG&A and cost of goods sold hasn\u2019t changed.","Steve Strycula","Okay. So, with that piece, if we\u2019re $50 million coming through cogs, should that be enough for the full year, nothing quarterly but should that give us close to about flat gross margins for the full year?","Dave Marberger","Here again, I don\u2019t want to give the specific gross margin guidance, but it\u2019s clearly going to be a tailwind for us.","Steve Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in. Sean, I suppose in part you\u2019ve probably conditioned this, to think about your business this way. But looking at the base performance and kind of the cycles you\u2019ve gone through of cleansing the portfolio and entering the rebuild mode with innovation, which is -- what I think we\u2019re really looking for this year, as you mentioned the biggest slate of innovation you had. But, as we look at the total points of distribution and the progression through the year, we came in with growth. And as we mine the data, it looks like we\u2019ve seen accelerating declines on distribution, including the three brands that you\u2019re highlighting, Marie Callender\u2019s, Hunt\u2019s, Chef Boyardee, all seen sort of distribution declines. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? Are we sort of in innovation replacement cycle where the innovation is kind of netting out past innovations falling away or have we found sort of another leg of rationalization that may be weighing on performance?","Sean Connolly","It\u2019s a little bit of everything, Jason. Let me try to break it down for you, give you an example of kind of the diversity of it. So, for example, on Hunt\u2019s we\u2019ve got some restages coming out, which means we\u2019ve got the old products going out, the new products coming in; there\u2019ll be a gap between the two where new product doesn\u2019t scan and that will show up in the short-term window as if the TPDs have gone down, then they come back. That\u2019s a dynamic. But we also have things going on, Marie Callender\u2019s is a good example of it. Slim Jim and Swiss Miss are other good examples where part of our playbook is to actually reduce TPDs and put more facings against high velocity TPDs and drive growth. I\u2019ll point you back to the case study I gave, I think it was last quarter on Slim Jim where we\u2019re doing that pretty aggressively. That\u2019s a piece of it as well. And it\u2019s one of the reasons I point out usually every other quarter that TPDs can be helpful but they can also be a bit misleading at times. You got to look at kind of the total results of the business as well as in particular the velocities, because when we intentionally reduce TPDs, it usually to pick up facings on higher velocity items and it drives overall sales growth. So, that\u2019s what you got going on.","I think, just as I look back on this whole year, we build these plans based on certain planning assumptions. And clearly for fiscal \u201819 overall, some things played out differently than we expected when we built the plan. For example, we didn\u2019t plan for a huge tinplate inflation, didn\u2019t plan for this, so we needed to price over the non-economic follow-on behaviors like certain players in some of our categories. We didn\u2019t obviously plan for recalls and co-packer issues. So, it\u2019s been a dynamic environment including some of Pinnacle\u2019s challenges. But all things considered, as we think about fiscal \u201820 and the innovations slate we\u2019ve got, the fact that we\u2019ve got our arms wrapped around Pinnacle pretty well right now, we think we navigated some of these things we didn\u2019t anticipate pretty well. We have posted our second consecutive year of organic growth, which is something that not all can point to in this environment. And as we pointed out earlier, I think that gives us a solid foundation on which to build going forward here, with our best innovation slate yet. So, overall, I'm pretty positive about kind of how things sack up as we move from first half to second half and throughout our strategic planning horizon.","Jason English","That's helpful. And one more for me. You mentioned the planning assumptions that you start with the beginning of the year. You've suggested that you expect this competitive intensity to abate as you progress through the year. But, as we\u2019ve seen before when companies pursue volume-over-value, it can take years before it ends poorly. So, what gives you confidence that it will abate? And second part to that question, what's the risk to your guidance, if it does not in fact abate?","Sean Connolly","Well, if you look at our Company as an example, it can take years to abate as a total portfolio, but it usually doesn't take a long time to abate at a category level, because you simply can't afford to sustain it for very long across multiple categories. So, if you're doing that as a portfolio enterprise, it\u2019s just too expensive to do this for too long, especially when you're doing it in the face of inflation, using the tomato example today, just is not an affordable strategy. It just draws too many resources from other part to the P&L to be able to hold it. So, we\u2019ve seen it before. It historically has almost always proven to be transitory and there are some things that we can do from time-to-time that help it to be transitory, if we need to do those things. So, that's how we\u2019ll navigate it.","Jason English","Okay. Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hey, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just had a question for you, first on this obviously kind of abrupt change in the promotional environment in the quarter. And it's not clear to me yet how you're responding to these challenges. So, it sounds like you're selectively responding. Is that the way to think about? And is that a pressure point on gross margin in the first half of the year, as you selectively respond to these challenges?","Sean Connolly","Yes. I think what we\u2019re conveying is we're not going to kind of unveil our response on each and every case study. That probably wouldn't be a wise competitive approach doing things like. Principally, we don't want to look at all these things and just say automatically, hey, we think we should respond because these things tend to be transitory in nature, even in the absence of a response from us. But, should somebody want to rent market share and try to sustain it for longer than a narrow window, then we will absolutely consider responding. We will look at each and every -- thankfully, we don't see a lot of these things across the portfolio. We haven't seen this kind of behavior in quite some time now. But it does come up, and we will look at it on a case-by-case basis. And that's probably as much details I\u2019d get into on it.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then, just another question in relation to fiscal \u201820. So, I think about some of the unique factors that occurred in fiscal \u201819, I just want to understand which ones get better, don't recur, maybe improve a bit year-over-year. Obviously one that comes to mind is Ardent Mills. Do you expect it to get -- to make up that sort of $0.06 differential this coming year, based on your outlook? Any other unique factors you call out for fiscal \u201820 that help support that rate of EPS growth for the year?","Dave Marberger","Chris, related to margins, given the volatility of the business, we don't give specific guidance, but generally our planning posture is we're roughly in line for fiscal \u201820 where we landed for fiscal \u201819. So, that's generally how we will plan that.","In terms of year-on-year, there are a lot of puts and takes as you go into fiscal \u201820. I think, specific to Q4, clearly we had some manufacturing challenges, I called out specifically 50 basis points of impact on our gross margins in Q4 that were just pure costs of the recall and some write-offs. So, they will not recur in Q4 of next year. So, they are discrete costs. We have synergies that are obviously ramping up, so that's going to be a big benefit. But, we're also investing some of that synergy back in to drive our innovation slate. So, there's going to be a clear increase in our innovation related investment.","So, realize productivity, we're coming on that, but we also have inflation, we have quite -- so there's just a lot of puts and takes and balances. But as we went through it all, we planned it, we scenario planned, we came up with our fiscal year \u201820 plan, and that drove our guidance, and we feel good about it.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thanks. The Gardein brand, really good brand, really good products, and you're clearly talking about plans to leverage it further here. Is this an incremental investment beyond what you've already planned for the next few years? And if not, where's it coming from? Are you having to take it from other brands that you had plans to invest behind, particularly in Pinnacle? And then, just a tactical question, I noticed that you\u2019re co-branding Gardein in the frozen category. That tends to be a risky proposition, gets a little confusing for the consumer. Have you thought through the risks of having two brands on one pack? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes. First of all, Rob, we\u2019ve always, since we acquired it, viewed Gardein as an attractive growth asset. That's why we talked about it at Investor Day, we served it at CAGNY and we spent capital to build the capacity. I think, what's changed, I think we can all acknowledge that it was hard to see the consumer fever pitch, for this space, gathering quite ahead of steam it has done as quickly as it's done. So, the upshot of all of this is that the market opportunity is quite a bit bigger than we're counting on. Does that mean that the investment behind it will be bigger? Potentially so to take advantage of it. But keep in mind, that investment is not a tax on EBIT. Gardein has got pretty good gross margin. So, as we sell more, and if we pick up the kind of tailwinds, we get in a compounding curve over the strategic plan horizon, those sales will generate additional fuel for growth that we will invest back to even accelerate those sales further. So, it's kind of a virtuous cycle here we've got going on Gardein. And overall the additional upside to it just helps us feel that much better about our long-term prospects and our fiscal 2022 outlook.","With respect to this kind of partner branding approach, let me just try to explain how we're thinking about Gardein. To the degree we sell kind of a pure blood meat product, so a chicken alternative, a burger alternative, a hotdog alternative, a sausage alternative, that will stand alone as a Gardein brand. But one of the things we have learned over and over and over again at Conagra is that the name of the game is velocity. And velocity is always stronger when it's not a new brand in an established space, for example, single-serve frozen meals, but it's an icon brand that has brought modern attributes into that space. In this case, we have a power brand such as Healthy Choice as an example. Healthy Choice is an absolute juggernaut and icon in single-serve meals. But each and every year, we will look to find new modern attributes to bring to the consumer. In this particular window that we're in here now over the next several years, one of these new attributes that we know the consumer is going to be looking for is meat alternatives in the space where meat used to be. So for example in Healthy Choice, where they -- the consumer used to buy 20 chicken based Healthy Choice bowls a year, they may buy 16 and buy 4 meal alternatives. And Gardein, because we will have a presence in the meat space, we already have almost $200 million business out there, has tremendous credentials in the plant alternative space, credentials in taste, credentials in texture, credentials in aroma and credentials across all day parts, breakfast, lunch, dinner and protein types. So, instead of showing up as the thousandth brand, in this plant-based alternative space with no credentials, we think the power of Gardein which has tremendous credentials and plant base with the icon of a Healthy Choice in single-service healthy meals, works even stronger for us.","We are doing similar things right now, by the way, in our sweet treats business with Duncan Hines perfect size where we cobranded with Oreo. And we like what we see there, we've done it before. So, this is not kind of an ingredient inside piece. This is a way to really quickly break through at the point of purchase and make it immediately evident to the consumer within 2 seconds flat, what they're getting, and give them confidence that it\u2019s going to be a good evening experienced.","So, we actually think that that is not a risky proposition but that is that's the optimum way to build ubiquity in kind of holistic meals in this plant-based space.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you. And I appreciate you taking the question, given the hour. This is going to go back over some ground. But I wanted to clear on something. So, your stock is obviously reacting negatively. You\u2019ve upgraded your revenue dying for the next year. Sean, can you just be clear about something? It sounded like problems within the fourth quarter got worse as the quarter progressed. So, you did mention in one of your questions -- one of your responses to a question that Nielsen data was giving you maybe some confidence that things were getting better. So, maybe can you just bridge the gap here? If things were getting worse as it got closer to the end of the fourth quarter, did you have knowledge that the pricing and canned tomatoes has recovered from private label? Do you have confidence that these negative promotional events going on in frozen single-serve meals, has that ended at this point? Is that why you can be so confident to raise the revenue guidance for fiscal \u201820?","Sean Connolly","David, when you were looking at quarterly results and change versus year a ago, it's not just a function of what's happening right now; it's a function of what happened in the year ago period. Right? So, as an example, if you look at more recent Chef results, you'll see, you'll see better optics than we saw at the end of Q4. And that reflects the fact that there were significant merchandising activities in the end of Q4 a year ago that we didn't get this year; it dropped off. In terms of the drop-off as the quarter unfolded, simply put, we were expecting a fairly strong period 11 and period 12, which are the last two months of our year and at the end of the fourth quarter, and we just didn't get it at the level we discussed, which was the Marie merch, the Chef merch and the private label pricing actions within canned tomatoes, as well as some of these manufacturing challenges that really hit us toward the end of the quarter. So, that's really what it's about.","We will have things that will improve in Q1. We'll still be doing things to upgrade the portfolio and do value-over-volume as we move Q1 and Q2 but then we will also be folding in the innovation slate. So, a lot going on this year as we get the Pinnacle business back up and running. But that\u2019s really kind of how it unfolded there in the fourth quarter, particularly in our period 11 and period 12.","David Driscoll","If I could do a follow-up, it\u2019s related but a bit separate. But, given the difficulty that you had in the canned operations, I mean it\u2019s pretty disappointing if private label doesn\u2019t raise prices when the cost of the can goes up so much. So, what I hear from your guys at your Analyst Day and today is this amazing amount of new products in very exciting portions of the portfolio, but the can portion just doesn\u2019t feel like it, and then we get this negative hit but private label just not acting well. Why not sell those canned portions of the portfolio so that the residual leftover would really just get to focus on all these exciting new product opportunities that you lay out? I mean, they all sound great but it hurts when you suddenly get these oddball activities going on within the canned portion of the portfolio. How do you think about that how would you respond to that?","Sean Connolly","Yes. We got -- it\u2019s a fair question, David. We\u2019ve got a number of grocery businesses that we put under this heading, we call reliable contributors, which is basically saying -- that\u2019s what we expect with them. We expect them to contribute reliably in the fullness of time. We have a variety of canned food businesses that have quite frankly been very reliable contributors over the last several years, Hunt\u2019s is a good example of one of those businesses as has Chef. It is quite possible that from time to time for all the reasons we\u2019ve discussed quite a bit today that we can see kind of this non-economic behavior by competition. That will happen from time to time.","But, it doesn\u2019t tend to happen often and it does tend to be transitory. So, to label a reliable contributor as no longer reliably contributing is if that the perpetual notion is a bit of an overreaction. But I'm not going to say that we don\u2019t evaluate these kinds of things all the time. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a company in our space that\u2019s been as active as we have over the last five years in reshaping the portfolio. And that includes divesting things that are kind of chronic drag on what we\u2019re trying to accomplish. So, we\u2019re always looking at that. We did more of that this quarter. I just wouldn\u2019t want you to paint -- to label canned foods as not reliably contributing as a perpetual notion when that\u2019s just not been what we experienced. In fact, what we\u2019ve experienced is, historically it\u2019s been a high cash flow business and it\u2019s thrown off a lot of cash, a lot of fuels for growth elsewhere in the portfolio like frozen.","David Driscoll","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question today comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. I can imagine investors are coming out today with the impression that your guidance for fiscal \u201820 is more optimistic than it was in the past or at least eating into a margin safety as you need more things to come together to hit the plan, given what you said about Hunt\u2019s and Chef Boyardee and Marie Callender\u2019s which are likely a negative versus original planning into the first half. If that\u2019s true, I mean, perhaps you could tell us what positive offsets you\u2019re thinking about versus your original thinking for fiscal \u201820 that are keeping that same guidance. And I have a quick follow-up.","Sean Connolly","I think, again, we\u2019re not sitting here patting ourselves on the back for what I would call a real raise for the \u201820 guidance at the high end of sales; it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s really a recovery of Q4 because the issues we experienced in Q4, we don\u2019t expect to repeat. So, really, we\u2019re just getting back to basically the same place we plan to all along. And underpinning that is an operating plan that is counting on a lot from some very robust innovation that transcends not only our most strategic segments, frozen and snacks and Legacy CAG but also some of the businesses in Pinnacle, which will contribute for part of the year as organic. So, we're counting on continued performance, like we\u2019ve seen on our innovation the last few years, but now we're seeing it on a bigger slate. And we're excited about this Gardein opportunity, which is really not just a '20 opportunity, but that's to tee up the point that that will continue to serve us well and help us navigate other things we're doing as we move through fiscal 2022.","David Palmer","And then, just a follow-up, you talked about Hunt\u2019s canned tomatoes and Chef Boyardee priority after the pricing actions, what's the confidence and the potential timing of a recovery there or perhaps visibility already that that's going to get out of the promotion penalty box? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Well, we will get out of it. I'm not going to give you exact timing. These are good businesses. I mean, got unbelievable relative market share on both of those businesses. How we navigate through it, I'm not going to disclose that; it may come a number of different ways, but we'll keep our power dry on that. But, you're talking about two brands here that are number one market share by far in their categories. And as I mentioned earlier, when we get our price gaps right, our merchandising right, we can recover volume rather quickly on these businesses. So, it's just a question of how is that going to unfold and exactly when is that going to hold, we\u2019re not going to get into that detail quite here today.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Kearney for any closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","We're pleased with the overall accomplishments during the quarter, and here I'll mention a few. We grew profits in the Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods operating segments. This occurred as we significantly increased our marketing investment to build for the future and take advantage of better margins. We completed the acquisition of Ralcorp, which is truly transformational for our company, putting us in a position for faster growth and participating in a very exciting space within our industry: private brands. While it's still very early, we're making good progress on integration and identifying growth synergies. And shortly after quarter end, we announced an agreement to form the Ardent Mills JV, which we expect will also be transformational and which brings together terrific leadership in the milling industry to meet changing customer and consumer demands.","John and I will provide more detail on those accomplishments and update you on our business, and then we'll open the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.","Before we get started, Chris has a few remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. If you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A document or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. I'm pleased with our third quarter results and with what we're expecting to deliver for the full fiscal year. Diluted EPS on a comparable basis was $0.55 for the third quarter, up 4%, with both the Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments posting profit growth while we significantly increased marketing investment. In terms of the quarter's EPS performance, it's worth pointing out that our incremental marketing investment was about $0.04 per share this quarter for our base business. That's part of the strategy we discussed earlier this year of taking advantage of better Consumer Foods margins to reinvest back in the business for long-term benefits.","As you know, we raised guidance in February for fiscal 2013 to comparable EPS of approximately $2.15, which we are reaffirming today. That's a 17% improvement over the previous fiscal year on a comparable basis. As we communicated before, the EPS guidance of $2.15 reflects about $0.05 of expected contribution from the Ralcorp business. As a reminder, we owned Ralcorp for only 27 days in the third quarter.","In terms of our operations, let me start with the Consumer Foods segment, where sales were up 7%, driven by acquisitions. Volumes improved sequentially by about a point but continued to reflect the challenges in the marketplace. Organic volume was down 3% and price\/mix was favorable by about the same amount. As of now, we have lapped most of the significant pricing we took last fiscal year to deal with inflation. We're confident that volumes will continue to sequentially improve in Q4 and into fiscal 2014, and we expect to see less contribution from pricing for that same reason.","Acquisitions drove the biggest part of the overall sales growth in Consumer Foods this quarter. We've not yet lapped all the acquisitions we completed over the last few quarters that pertain to this segment, and several of our brands posted good organic results as well. As an example, we're seeing good growth from our Hunt's canned tomatoes as we advertise to communicate their FlashSteamed difference. Andr\u00e9 told you at CAGNY about the work we're doing in tomatoes at the retail level. That work, along with the A&P spend, is driving growth in this important center store category.","We also saw strong growth from Ro*Tel Tomatoes. Both Hunt's and Ro*Tel products took share, grew volume and grew net sales during the quarter. Ro*Tel is a great example of a brand with a very strong regional following that's growing into a national presence benefiting from strong A&P. PAM cooking spray and Reddi-wip toppings both did well this quarter. They both gained share and grew sales dollars and volumes. As with other brands, very clear point-of-difference advertising has played a big role in their growth.","And Marie Callender's continued on its winning streak with gains in net sales, share and volume. You heard us talk about Marie's success at CAGNY. Not only is the food fantastic, Marie has also benefited from messaging that is true to the brand's personality. Our intent is to be very pragmatic with our messaging and clearly point out the reason to buy our brands, capturing what sets our great offerings apart from the competition. This makes for a strong connection with today's consumer mindset where everyone wants to know exactly what they're getting for their hard-earned dollar. We're committed to investing behind our brands as part of developing loyalty for the long term.","As you've heard us say before, we have a strong innovation pipeline and continue to introduce great new items that build on platforms we've been developing. At CAGNY, we shared with you some of the latest in terms of baked microwave innovation, frozen desserts and frozen breakfast. New items like these are a key reason for our confidence in our company's future.","Consumer Foods grew comparable operating profit by 3%, which, as I've said before, includes a 33% increase in marketing as we build for the future and take advantage of improved margins. This investment was made possible by the margin benefits stemming from pricing discipline, good cost savings and more manageable inflation.","We're working hard to integrate our acquisitions. With regard to the Ralcorp business, which is reported in its own segments, we had only a few weeks worth of contribution during the quarter, having closed the deal on January 29. In aggregate, these assets gave us $292 million of sales and $22 million of comparable operating profit for that time frame. We're in the early days of incorporating this portfolio into the ConAgra Foods family. In the near term, the focus is on tactical pricing adjustments and supply chain efficiencies as well as organizational development work. We expect this acquisition to generate about $0.05 of net EPS benefit this fiscal year, and in that $0.05 per share projection, we have, of course, planned for customer transition matters and disruptions.","We feel good about having closed this transformational transaction earlier than planned, and we're confident that the progress we've already made in integration will serve us as a good foundation for growth. We have distinct, focused resources working on the integration, covering all facets of operations so that we consider all opportunities for top and bottom line synergies. We've already identified some product sourcing opportunities where the existing ConAgra Foods businesses can add value to Ralcorp products, and we've begun to identify top line opportunities. We're integrating at a pace and sequence that will optimize the long-term growth of this major acquisition, so we are obviously being deliberate and thorough up front to make sure the integration drives success.","It's extremely important that we play this out for the long term and that we set ourselves up for success. We, of course, will find some opportunities to course correct and other places to build upon Ralcorp's successes. There will clearly be some bumps and bruises as we put these 2 companies together. We expect that, we plan for that, and we ask for a bit of patience while we learn the landscape. I can tell you that we are very confident in our ability to achieve all the cost synergies we've discussed with you, and we knew it would take a little longer to turn the customer-facing side of this into the sustainable, organic growth engine that we desire. But I am just as confident we will get there.","We clearly believe that the consumer and customer demand for private brands is not only here to stay but will play a leading role in the industry's growth. That's the primary reason for the Ralcorp transaction, and as we capitalize on the potential for private brands, we're confident it will serve our shareholders well.","Moving on to Commercial Foods. The segment performed well on the fiscal third quarter, up in sales, but up more significantly in profit. Profit was up 18% from a year ago, primarily reflecting favorable wheat market conditions, good volumes, mix and operating efficiencies in the ConAgra Mills operation.","Lamb Weston potato operations posted modest profit growth, largely as planned, given the nature of the comparison. They had a really strong quarter a year ago. Lamb Weston's international volumes declined in a few key Asian markets, but the future outlook globally is still bright.","For some context on the U.S. market, the competitive landscape in the U.S. has become a bit more intense given how some major customers are handling their bidding processes. We've dealt with this before as a company. We'll prioritize our capacity for the right mix and manage through it over time. Lamb Weston continues to focus on high-potential, high-margin products such as Sweet Potato Fries, which continue to show growth, and to provide other innovative solutions and strong customer service.","I'm sure most of you saw our announcement last month about our agreement to form Ardent Mills. Ardent Mills will combine the operations of ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling, and the ownership of the new company will be shared between ConAgra Foods, Cargill and CHS. We expect the transaction to close late this calendar year.","Ardent Mills will bring together outstanding leadership in the milling industry in order to continue to meet growing and changing customer and consumer demands. We believe this company will be the go-to company in terms of innovation, customer service and efficiencies and, in the process, generate substantial cost synergies. Ardent Mills will have a broad footprint and network of facilities in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, including 44 flour mill locations, 3 bakery mix facilities and 1 specialty bakery.","We expect Ardent Mills to be accretive to our earnings over the long term given the growth potentials and synergies, and we're excited for the future of Ardent Mills. We believe the formation of Ardent Mills will contribute to our long-term earnings growth potential while removing some volatility from our sales.","All in all, we're pleased with the very strong year that fiscal 2013 is shaping up to be. In the third quarter, we achieved good profits for our base business, closed on a transformational deal, made significant investment in marketing and innovation, and we also set up our milling business for a great future as part of a focused joint venture. I look forward to our year-end discussion in June when we can share our view of fiscal 2014 and our upwardly revised long-term goals as a result of the Ralcorp transaction.","With that, I'll turn it over to John for more financial details.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I am going to touch on 6 topics this morning: our third quarter performance highlights; some Ralcorp acquisition matters; comparability matters; the recently announced agreement to form a new flour milling venture, Ardent Mills; cash flow, capital and balance sheet items; and finally, some comments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013.","Let's start with the fiscal third quarter performance highlights. Overall, the third quarter results reflect a continuation of the good financial performance that we saw in the first half of the fiscal year. As we previously noted, we have significantly increased our marketing investments and are lapping stronger performance in the back half of the fiscal year. So while we're pleased with our financial performance, our year-over-year profit growth is more modest this quarter.","For the quarter, we reported net sales of $3.9 billion, up 13%, driven by the addition of Ralcorp as well as pricing and acquisitions in our consumer segment. In our Commercial Foods segment, where sales were up modestly, pricing and mix improvements offset modest volume declines. Net sales also reflect the impact of higher year-over-year wheat prices in our flour milling operations.","Also for the fourth quarter, we recorded fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.29 versus $0.67 in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, including significant cost related to our recent Ralcorp acquisition, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.55 versus $0.53 in the prior year quarter, a 4% increase.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few highlights starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $2.3 billion, up about 7% from the year-ago period. This reflects about 7 points of growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales were essentially flat and reflect favorable price\/mix of about 3% and a base volume decline of about 3%, which represents a sequential improvement over the second quarter.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $289 million or up about 3% from the year-ago period. The operating profit improvement reflects the benefit from acquisitions, our margin management initiatives, moderating product cost inflation and a significant and planned increase in marketing cost. The impact from foreign exchange this quarter on both net sales and operating profit for the segment was immaterial.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $80 million in the quarter. For the fiscal third quarter, we experienced inflation of about 1%, a bit better than our expectations. On marketing, Consumer Foods' advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $120 million, up about 45% from the prior year quarter, principally driven by a $27 million or 33% increase in marketing investments in our base business.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion, or up about 1%, reflecting pricing and mix improvements across the segment, which were partially offset by a 1% volume decline driven by lower Lamb Weston volumes. The pass-through of higher wheat costs in the milling operations had a positive $17 million impact on net sales for this fiscal quarter.","The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, increased 18% from the year-ago period to $177 million. The strong year-over-year performance reflects improvement in our milling operations and modest improvement at Lamb Weston over a very strong prior year quarter.","Moving on to corporate expenses. For this quarter, corporate expenses, adjusted for items impacting comparability, were $84 million for the quarter versus $61 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher incentive compensation costs and the addition of the Ralcorp corporate expenses. We continue to expect our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to be in the range of 34%.","Now let me comment briefly on the Ralcorp business. Our results reflect almost 4 weeks of operations from this acquisition. Net sales for the Ralcorp business were approximately $292 million, and operating profit, excluding items impacting comparability, was approximately $22 million, about what we projected. The net accretion for our fiscal fourth quarter should also be in line with our earlier expectations, and we are comfortable with our fiscal 2013 accretion estimate for Ralcorp of about $0.05 per share.","During the integration period and until we implement long-term organization changes related to the Ralcorp acquisition, we will report the results of Ralcorp's operations in 2 segments: the Ralcorp Food Group segment and the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery Products segment. As we go forward, our focus is going to be on the EBIT, synergy and EPS accretion goals for Ralcorp that we shared with you at CAGNY.","During our first year of ownership, we won't focus on year-over-year results for a few reasons. First, our focus will be on the information covered in our historical financial statements, which obviously will exclude prior year Ralcorp information during the first year. Similarly, we expect to manage the Ralcorp business differently. For instance, our approach to commodity management, pricing and balancing margin management and growth will be different, so the past Ralcorp performance won't be our reference point.","And finally, we have a number of reporting and systems matters, such as changes in fiscal periods, units of measure and segment reporting that we will be working through in the first year. Those can be pretty complex from a housekeeping standpoint and will likely preclude us from having useful comparisons to the prior year.","Obviously, our goal is to provide transparency into the performance of the Ralcorp business in terms of the current contribution to our results, and our focus will be on the near-term goals we shared at CAGNY. Overall, we're excited about the opportunities that this acquisition provides us for long-term growth and attractive accretion over the next couple of years driven by strong synergies.","Now I'll move on to my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.26 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter's reported EPS related to several items. The most significant comparability item this quarter relates to acquisition matters, including transaction-related costs, acquisition-related restructuring and integration costs. As you might expect, the vast majority of these costs relate to our recent acquisition of Ralcorp.","In all, we recorded approximately $102 million or $0.16 per share of acquisition-related expenses. We also incurred about $13 million or $0.03 per share of incremental tax expense related to the adverse impact of the transaction cost on our income tax rate this quarter.","Next, on hedging for the fiscal third quarter. The net hedging expense included in corporate expenses was approximately $27 million or $0.04 per share. In addition, in the fiscal third quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $10 million or $0.02 per share related to assets that we acquired last fiscal year in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings of a supplier. And finally, we incurred about $5 million or $0.01 per share of expense related to historical legacy environmental matters.","Next, I'll address the recently announced agreement to form a new flour milling venture, Ardent Mills. As noted in our March 5 announcement, ConAgra Foods, Cargill and CHS will contribute their respective flour milling operations to Ardent Mills on a cash-free, debt-free basis. ConAgra Foods and Cargill will each own 44% of Ardent Mills, with CHS owning 12%. We will account for our ownership as an equity method investment.","As we don't expect this transaction to close until late in the calendar year, we expect it to have no material impact on our fiscal 2013 results. We're very excited about the transaction and its potential to create significant value over time as cost synergies are realized. It will be modestly dilutive to earnings per share initially, as interest cost and higher amortization will not be fully offset by the cost synergies realized at first. However, over time, we expect a significant level of value creation from combining the flour milling operation -- from combining these flour milling operations driven by compelling cost synergies.","Also, as noted in the announcement, we currently expect the new entity to be self-financed through cash flow from operations and its own bank debt and credit facility. The structure and amount of the Ardent Mills debt financing will be determined during the pre-closed period. We, along with Cargill and CHS, intend to receive cash distributions from Ardent Mills at closing. Based on initial estimates, we expect to receive a distribution of approximately $400 million, and we currently expect to use those proceeds to accelerate our debt repayment plans related to the Ralcorp acquisition debt.","Next, I'll cover my fifth topic: cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $724 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We continue to emphasize cash flow within our business, and for fiscal year 2013, we expect to deliver operating cash flows in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. This estimate reflects the cash flow impacts from the Ralcorp transaction and its operations.","On working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full fiscal year, the increase in working capital will be driven by our acquisitions as we continue to maintain our focus on cash conversion cycle metrics in our base businesses.","On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $109 million versus $79 million in the prior year period. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $500 million, including fiscal 2013 CapEx related to our recently announced expansion at our Lamb Weston facility in Boardman, Oregon, and including approximately $50 million related to the recently acquired Ralcorp business.","Net interest expense was $71 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $50 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily driven by the additional interest expense related to the Ralcorp acquisition.","Dividends for the quarter increased from $99 million in the year-ago quarter to $101 million, reflecting a higher dividend rate partially offset by a lower number of shares.","On capital allocation, as we noted at CAGNY, our capital allocation priority through fiscal 2015 will be the repayment of debt. As I previously noted, we expect to use the proceeds from the Ardent Mills transaction to accelerate and increase the targeted level of debt repayment through fiscal 2015.","I would also note that our net debt balance at the end of our fiscal third quarter is somewhat lower than we had planned, as more cash was available at the close of the Ralcorp transaction. Subsequent to quarter end, we paid off $566 million of certain Ralcorp private placement debt to complete our acquisition financing plans. Additionally, we are on track to repay $300 million of debt before the end of our fiscal 2013. Therefore, we are off to a very good start on improving our leverage ratios.","As previously announced, we expect to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we delever, and we expect to significantly reduce our share repurchases during this time as well. And while we plan to constrain our acquisition activity in the near term as we repay debt, we will continue to prudently support the right investments for our business, including investments to support innovation, production capacity and our cost savings initiatives.","Now onto our outlook. We continue to expect our fiscal year 2013 fully diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be approximately $2.15. This guidance reflects the benefit from owning Ralcorp for about 4 months of the fiscal year. In our outlook for Ralcorp, we have taken into account factors such as seasonality, market conditions, contract timing and transition impacts, and we remain comfortable with about $0.05 of EPS benefit in fiscal 2013 and $0.25 in 2014. We currently expect the fiscal fourth quarter to show strong year-over-year earnings growth that reflects the contributions from Ralcorp and other acquisitions, marketing costs comparable to the prior year quarter and a soft lap in our flour milling business.","Overall, we are very pleased with the financial performance and the strong earnings growth from our fiscal 2012 comparable base. As we said at CAGNY, we expect to provide our estimate for our fiscal 2014 earnings and our updated long-term algorithm when we communicate our fiscal fourth quarter earnings this summer. Aside from the information we provided on the pending Ardent Mills transaction, we don't have any additional details to offer today on our fiscal 2014 plan or on our long-term algorithm.","That concludes our formal remarks. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Andr\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First off, thanks for breaking out the Ralcorp results separately. It does help quite a bit with transparency, both Ralcorp and on the core. I guess my question is, is on Ralcorp specifically. Obviously, it can be a challenge to model a deal in the initial stages, the first 27 days. And as you said, the year-over-year comps may be tough to assess for a while given how you're going to run the business going forward. But the results, at least in the quarter, for Ralcorp top and bottom line were a bit below what we were looking for. So I was hoping you could maybe help put some of the Ralcorp results into maybe better context so we can get a sense of how we should think about it going forward. In other words, maybe what are some of the trends in some of the key Ralcorp businesses right now? We know that private label in general had a bit of a tougher year in 2012. And what is your comment around -- I think you said the need to make some tactical pricing adjustments at Ralcorp. How does that play into that as well?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew. I would tell you, obviously, we are really very positive on being able to get this deal closed and on that long-term opportunity being very consistent with our Recipe for Growth. And as you said, it is only 27 days. And actually as of today, I think, we're in week 9, so it's still a very steep learning curve. There clearly, as we expected, are some normal disruptions, including some top line challenges, as you noted. And I would say those stem primarily from some disruption -- their own integration, which they were about 6 months into as we entered the picture, and then, of course, our integration on top of that. And then I would tell you, as we get into it, we've seen that they had gotten upside down on several key commodities, and those tactical pricing adjustments you mentioned, clearly, those are in process. As we take a look at things that need course correction and employ our Center of Excellence on revenue growth management, risk management, et cetera, we are in process of making those adjustments. So I'd say that clearly is probably -- those 2 things are clearly right in our -- on top of our radar screen that we are working on and are -- have impacted those results in that first 27 days. But we are very, very confident in terms of the numbers that we have shared, both at CAGNY and here today, and that is really driven by a very strong sense of conviction on our supply chain efficiencies. We're well underway there and believe we will deliver all of those, and we also believe, as we get into it, we are starting to see some top line growth synergies as well. So this whole notion of very strong vision or conviction on leveraging our scale and our CPG capabilities into this very fragmented space, that's going to play out. We remain very confident on that, and we don't take -- we really don't take too much message from this first 27 days.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just second, volume in consumers, you mentioned, was sequentially better, still off about 3%. I guess, in the most recent scanner data, it looked a bit better, and obviously with some of the increased marketing you did this quarter and the lapping of some of the pricing, are you starting to already see sort of, again, even more sequentially improved volume results as you go into the fiscal fourth quarter?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Andrew, this is Andr\u00e9. I'm going to take that question, and I'm going to elaborate on it a little bit more than even the question that you asked. But to answer to your question, yes, we are. We're seeing much more positive scanner data, as I'm sure you are as well, for the start of our fourth quarter. And we're very optimistic that our fourth quarter volume performance trend that you'll see will be significantly improved from where we were in Q3. So let me share a little bit -- because I know there's a lot of investors thinking about our volume in consumer for Q3. Let me identify where the -- really, the issues were in 3 brands that made up about 90% of our miss, and that was Banquet frozen, Chef Boyardee and Orville microwave popcorn. So let me take each of those and talk a little bit about each one of them. One is Banquet. We've been talking about this brand all year, and it really has to do with the significant amount of pricing we took on this value brand at the beginning of our fiscal year. So we, finally, have lapped that, and as we look at Q4 numbers in the start of Q4, we're seeing that brand turnaround pretty significantly, as we expected. So that's been a pretty consistent pattern, and that was because of the volume miss in Q3. We see that getting better in Q4. Chef Boyardee was simply one thing. It was timing of merchandising. The merchandising that we had versus a year ago, which was in Q3, is now in Q4, and that corrects itself, as you'll see, in the Q4 results. The last one is probably the smallest amount of our miss, but it was a miss nonetheless, and that was in Orville Redenbacher's microwave popcorn. It's probably one that's going to require us to get -- to do a little bit more work on how do we get this microwave popcorn category back to growth, and that's something we're continuing to work on. So based on the shipment trends I'm seeing early in the fourth quarter as well as the IRI consumption numbers, I think we're very optimistic that we're going to see the Q4 results on volumes significantly get stepped up from where they were in Q3. And hopefully, that provides the audience some perspective on our volume issues in Q3.","Operator","And we'll move now to Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just 2 follow-ups, I guess, to Andrew's questions. One, first, in terms of Ralcorp, was there any sort of disruption or static just because the business was in transition, you were changing hands? Had customers maybe ordered more ahead of time to -- just to make sure that they weren't going to -- have a little of that extra safety stock ahead of the transition from Ralcorp to ConAgra? And is that at all a factor of kind of what you're dealing with now?","Gary M. Rodkin","Bryan, I don't think we've seen any evidence of that. There's the normal customer impatience, I would say, with, \"Hey, the deal is done. We want to see all the benefits of it today.\" And obviously, as we talked through it, they start to be -- understand that the integration takes a little while. But I can tell you from a customer standpoint, we've had one major top-to-top recently really talking about our story of trying to move from a very transactional or procurement-based model in private brands to a much more strategic partnership long term that would leverage those capability and scale that we have, and it was extremely positive, very engaged, and gave us a really good feeling that we're on the right track. But to your original question, I don't think we saw any evidence of inventory loading.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the marketing spend in the quarter, just 2 areas. Could you give us a little color in terms of where you're spending? And then maybe also just in terms of payback, what the time frame you're looking for in terms of seeing that affect the revenue growth. And then also just, is this now part of the base? As we go into next year, is this sort of a permanent re-basing of the marketing budget, or would you expect to see maybe a further increase next year?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Bryan, this is Andr\u00e9. I'm going to take that. Let me tell you where we're spending the money. I'll give you some color as to the brands. But it's really in, I would call, 4 buckets. The ones -- the primary one is brands that we're seeing very solid growth in. Gary articulated some of those. But we're doubling down some of the spending on brands that, I would call it, that have the hot hand. So brands such as Marie Callender's, PAM and Reddi-wip, which were cited earlier, where we're gaining unit share, we're gaining dollar share and our marketplace performance is very, very strong. The other areas we're devoting marketing to is in our innovation space. So one of the areas where we put some money behind in the quarter was, as we're starting to launch and get  this to more scale in Orville ready-to-eat, as an example, we're putting some money there. And obviously, we're doing some development work on the innovation that will be launched in the new fiscal year, fiscal '14, with respect to a lot of the innovation you saw at CAGNY. So there's dollars going behind innovation. We also are putting dollars behind brands that are expanding that are very strong regionally today that are growing, and we're expanding their footprint. So Gary mentioned one, which was Ro*Tel. We're also doing that with a very strong brand we have, Rosarita, as well as Wolf Chili, as they get out of their markets. So there's dollars going there. And lastly, we're starting to get into what we call big-platform marketing in the Shopper Marketing area, so many of you -- many consumers will see -- I mean, we're kicking it off officially, Child Hunger Ends Here, our big fourth quarter Shopper Marketing promotion that will be out there that we kick off at the Country Music Awards this coming weekend. So we're starting to get into this big platform-based marketing, which really good marketers in our space do that. So you'll see that's where we're spending the lion's share of our money. Second part of your question, is this really a re-basing of our marketing spending? Should we expect to see more next year? We're not going to comment on our algorithm for fiscal '14 just yet. But I think suffice it to say that, as we looked at our marketing, we looked at it on a full year basis that we needed to, this year, take the margin improvement we saw, we had the opportunity to go back and reinvest in our really strong brands. And I think you'll see us -- that's -- a lot of that has been done, and you'll see some of that leveling off. We'll talk more about what we're going to do with marketing when we talk in June about our fiscal '14 algorithm.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about -- you're sort of bucking the trend here, whereas some of the other consumer food companies we've seen lately have, and for whatever reason, in this current environment, cut their advertising spending as a percent of sales. You're going the opposite way. And I know you can't necessarily speak to what others are doing. But can you maybe talk about the environment that you're seeing that sort of allows you to do that whereas others are seeing something a little bit different out there that perhaps incents them to spend a little bit more on promotions, especially at a time when you're sort of at the end of your -- right before you're lapping your price increase from last year. Maybe you would have decided, perhaps rightly or wrongly, to invest some back in promotions as well. I'm just curious how you thought about that decision and when you came to it.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Ken, I think you're right on the money there. There's no question that we made a conscious tradeoff. We could have dropped those marketing dollars that -- those big incremental marketing dollars into EPS growth. We chose not to do that, because we really don't guide every single quarter to try and land exactly at a specific number. So we're committed to the annual number and believe that, because we have improved our margins through the pricing architecture and our productivity, that it was a wise long-term move that we could afford to do to invest against the brands the way that Andr\u00e9 just articulated. So we saw that as an opportunity this year that we should start to bolster the pull side of our business and do it in a very smart way, as Andr\u00e9 articulated, rather than just rent the volume with short-term pricing actions, because it's not sustainable. So that's the basic thought process. There's always challenges in the marketplace, and different competitors do different things, but we've stayed pretty disciplined to our model of pricing architecture here. And that's allowed us to invest against a more long-term marketing benefit.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, are you surprised, maybe a little frustrated from a competitive standpoint that some of your competitors, at least from what we're seeing out there, are doing something -- or maybe a different decision in terms of whether to spend behind marketing or drop price down a little bit?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Ken, I mean, I would always love to have people compete on a marketing basis, where you've got the brands articulating the benefits and letting the consumer make the choice, rather than the short-term price discounting, because, as you know, that can lead to a very bad place ultimately, and we've been there. So yes, I would prefer it to be there, but we have to recognize that we can't really dictate what competition does. So we'll try and play our game as best we can, and so far so good.","Operator","And we'll move now to David Palmer with UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The question back -- with regard to, I think, it was John's comment about the Ralcorp business and the revenue and profit focus will not -- will make those results heading into fiscal '14 perhaps not comparable. That implies a pretty big shift in management style of that business. Could you perhaps dig into that a little bit more, how you're going to be managing that business differently?","John F. Gehring","Yes. Let me start, David, and I may -- if I get a little bit off track here, feel free to clarify that. But I think -- I'd say the first thing is I think the history of Ralcorp was that they focused an awful lot on acquisitions, and they were rolling up various pieces of private label, and I think one of the byproducts of that is that's an organization that, historically, has not really focused on organic growth the way we have. So it's not that they don't have good capabilities, it's not that they're really -- not really good at cost. They have good customer relationships and all those things, but their DNA was not about organic growth. So I think as we've kind of started our integration and learning about the business, I think one of the learnings we've got is that -- and one of the challenges we have is we really need to orient the business and the leaders of the business towards organic sustainable growth. So that implies some trade-offs in terms of the things you do day in, day out. They're very good and focused on margins, but we think there's a balance to be had there between short-term profits and margins and long-term sustainable growth, not different from what we just talked about in our own business and the investments we've made in A&P. So I think that's certainly an area. I think another area would be certainly, I think, how we will manage commodities and some of the capabilities we bring to really connect our commodity decisions with our marketing and pricing decisions and how we go to market. I think those are some of the muscles that we've built over the last couple of years that we'll be able to leverage. And then I think related to that, the third big area is I think this whole area of pricing architecture and how do we leverage different kinds of analytics with a focus on organic growth as we apply pricing capability. So I think there are a number of issues there in terms of how we're going to run the business differently.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, David, I would say they ran a very successful model. It's just a very different one. Theirs was acquisitions and cost savings. We are starting to talk, and they have responded extremely well to our Recipe for Growth, that keyword being growth is new muscles for them, and that's something that we're going to bring to the party.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just switching gears to the commercial side. Paul, there were some questions -- there were some comments made about how some of your major customers were putting up more for bidding, perhaps weighing on your margins, and presumably, that was on the U.S. side of the business. And then also, it's been clear that the antibiotics issue in China has weighed on the business there. Can you talk about how much that's getting better as well?","Paul T. Maass","You bet, yes. So maybe I'll start with the second part first on the international piece. We had really strong growth the first half, slight decline here in the third quarter. And I would describe it as -- it's not alarming. I think it's more timing issues is the way I would look at that, and really believe in the long-term growth, globally, as still a big opportunity for us, even though we've got to work through the short-term issues, as you mentioned. And then in the U.S. domestic business, yes, there is -- the reality, some shifts in the distribution business from relationships to category management. As we work through that, it will be a little bit clunky. And our team's very focused on driving growth and success with the customers. We'll continue to do that. I think one of the benefits is we've got a very diverse portfolio geographically and product wise and channels that we go to market in. So I think as we work through these, one particular issue doesn't turn the business upside down, but it will be new muscles that our team's got to develop to effectively work through it.","Operator","And Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research has our next question.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I just had a quick question on the frozen business. I mean, obviously, we've all seen the news on Heinz. And historically, sometimes when companies are going through transactions themselves, like you've pointed out, there can be a certain dislocation. I'm just curious, have you seen -- do you expect to see any dislocation, I guess, from that core competitor within the frozen case? And if so, is part of your near-term marketing strategy also to hopefully be able to pick up some share there?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Rob, this is Andr\u00e9. I don't see it. I haven't seen it in the marketplace with that particular property that you mentioned, so I'm not expecting anything, but we'll be prepared to deal with things if they, in fact, do come up. Our game in frozen, as we've shared at CAGNY, is very broad based. We obviously compete now in many more locations, including breakfast and desserts, as we expand our adjacencies. That particular competitor is not necessarily in the dessert space, as an example. But we're going to play our game, as Gary has alluded to before. And we'll deal with any and all competitors as they come up. So we haven't seen anything, to answer your specific question.","Operator","And we'll hear now from Akshay Jagdale with Keybanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to -- given all the moving parts here with the acquisition, couple of questions, Gary, just regarding how, as analysts, you think we should practice success. So that's related to 2 things, and I'm very encouraged to see, obviously, the increase in marketing spending and the significant amount at that. But when we look at your reported numbers, organic growth, we don't see that reflected, right? So help me understand if there's 1 or 2 metrics that we should be looking at to judge the success of your marketing spending over the last 3 quarters going forward. And then secondly, similar to that, on the Ralcorp deal, what are the metrics we should be looking at to judge your success? Is it just the cost synergy number and being able to meet or beat that over the next year? That would be really helpful. And then secondly, on commodity costs, I was curious, you mentioned something about Ralcorp being upside down on a couple of commodities. I mean, in my estimates, your inflation base business is trending better than expected. I think you said it was 1% this quarter. We had projected Ralcorp to also be experiencing better commodity trends. So just, if you could help us understand how they're positioned, maybe how much they're hedged, and give us a sense of what you meant by upside down on a couple of commodities. That would be helpful.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, let me start on the marketing spend. I would tell you that, as you well know, it's not put a lot of money on television one night and see the volume the next day. It's a build over time. So we believe that our success should be measured on a go-forward basis on improving those volume trends. And as Andr\u00e9 said, we will see sequential volume improvement. We should see better performance in share in many of our categories. So I think you should look for us to show that starting in Q4 but going through F '14. That's how I would measure the impact of the marketing spend. And Chris, you want to tackle the Ralcorp?","Chris Klinefelter","Sure. On the Ralcorp, I'll just remind you that we put out some goal at the CAGNY that had to do with the incremental EBIT and synergies and EPS contribution from Ralcorp, and that's where our heads are about defining success with that acquisition. And also, just to bring you into context for, I believe, the third part of your question, John's remarks about the -- John and Gary's remarks about the commodities of Ralcorp were really more about explaining the context for why there is the requirement for tactical pricing adjustments, not necessarily to explain a margin differential in the quarter. So with that, Gary, do you have anything else you wanted to...","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I would just say, as we look forward, both the pricing architecture in our revenue growth management center of excellence and our risk management skill set both will be brought to bear on a go-forward basis. And I believe, as we integrate, you will see us perform differently in that regard as we look ahead.","Operator","And we'll hear now from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Wanted to talk about Ardent Mills. First, congratulations for what seems to be a really savvy strategic move there. To help us understand what this business may look like afterwards, can you give us a sense of the EBIT, the DNA and the CapEx that's tied to the wheat milling business right now?","Chris Klinefelter","Jason, this is Chris. I'll say that those are beyond the scope of the details we're going to offer now. There'll be more visibility when we get to the date of close of the transaction.","Gary M. Rodkin","The one metric that you might have. The net sales is projected to be about $4.3 billion.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Of Ardent?","Gary M. Rodkin","Ardent Mills and the combined business going forward. That gives you a little bit of sense. If you look at -- ConAgra Mills, today, is about $1.8 billion and Horizon Milling's about $2.5 billion. To give you a little bit of sense of scale. I don't know if that helps, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not really. You guys have already broken out the sales in your 10-K on the wheat milling, so it's more the profitability and the cash flow that I was trying to get to. But I can appreciate the desire to wait.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Deutsche Bank's Eric Katzman.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two quick questions, one to John. Given the ConAgra Mills change in the structure there, and along with -- as you get your hands around Ralcorp, kind of where do you see net debt to EBITDA at the end of calendar 2013 or the end of calendar -- or fiscal '14, however you want to describe it? And then maybe a little bit more broadly, Gary, maybe you could just talk about -- this is close to Andrew's question. Private label seems to have slowed down a bit and is kind of growing, let's say, in line with branded. What do you see from the consumer, given that you now have a pretty kind of broad-based view? And I suppose QSRs being a little bit weaker is probably also a conversation to focus on.","John F. Gehring","Yes. Eric, this is John. Let me take the first piece of that. I think right now, as we look at our debt to EBITDA, again, we came out of the gates a little bit favorable to what we had modeled, just based upon some additional cash available. I think by the end of fiscal '13, we would expect to be maybe slightly below the 4x. And I expect right now, I would estimate that by the end of fiscal '14, we should be worth somewhere south of 3.5x debt to EBITDA. So again, that's probably a little bit ahead of what we had originally modeled. And, clearly, the Ardent Mills, as well as the fast start we've got, has helped us get off to a good start.","Gary M. Rodkin","Eric, there always have been kind of short-term episodic blips driven by price gaps between branded and private label, and that has narrowed over the last several quarters. But there's a really long history of these patterns. And the long-term trajectory, we are very confident, is going to continue to go upward. A couple of pieces of insight, maybe. Our research says that 74% of consumers now are more open to buying more private brands than they were 2 years ago. Another factor is you're starting to see more of this tiered business. So as we've talked about leveraging our capabilities to take private brands a bit more upmarket, you see that in some accounts, but that's a trend that we see continuing to see this almost good, better, best. And again, there's this big runway ahead, if you take a look at the U.S. penetration at 18% of sales in food and private brands and Western Europe, Canada, Australia, et cetera, significantly bigger than that. I think U.K. is double that. So when you take all that and take a look at the customers, some of the customer channels that are performing the best, and you put all that together, I would say this kind of short-term flattening on private brands is exactly that. The long-term trajectory is still very strong.","Operator","And we have a question now from Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could help me a little bit on Lamb Weston. The strong growth in that business has been great the last few years. And my perception is that it's giving you some added flexibility to reinvest in the branded side. But I guess I'm trying to understand what the message here is. I've heard comments about competition getting a little more intense and some transitions from relationships to category management, I thought I heard. So is there -- or is the outlook still for growth for Lamb Weston for the next year, or is it going to be kind of a consolidation kind of period?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Rob. Let me start with that, then I'm going to turn it over to Paul. I would characterize it as an environment now that is a bit more challenging, as Paul touched on, with a couple of key customers really changing their game a bit. But again, we've got such a big broad-based portfolio of channels, customers, geographies that we continue to see this as a growth business. But a little bit more challenging than we've had very recently. Paul?","Paul T. Maass","And I would just for sure look at it as a growth business. We're very pleased with the current results, and some of the real short-term dynamics, we'll work our way through. The global opportunity is -- continues to look bright, even though you may have a timing issue in the short term. We're committed to reinvest back into this business, when you think about even the capital investment that John mentioned with building the new plant in Boardman, Oregon. Those are the things we are going to continue to do to really grow Lamb Weston.","Operator","And we have a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. The first question, in relation to Consumer Foods. If you look at the price\/mix contribution in the quarter, was mix positive as well? I saw more price\/mix than I expected. Was that a -- was that due to mix? Or was it just more pricing coming through than I thought?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Chris, this is Andr\u00e9. It was a combination of both. We had a little bit of price, as I mentioned. We've now lapped most of that going into Q4, and -- but we had good, solid mix results as well in the quarter.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then related to that, Andr\u00e9, is there a promotional -- do you expect promotional spend to tick up a bit going forward? I think you mentioned a couple of categories where it's getting a little bit more heated. But is that part of your plan going forward to be a little bit more aggressive on the promotional side?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","No, I think we're going to watch every one of our categories as we do every day to determine what we need to do to be competitive. But again, as we talked about, our game plan for this year, fiscal '13, was all about taking that margin upside that we were going to be delivering, investing back in our brands and having the right balance that we feel we need between the push and the pull. I don't think we\u2019re going to overemphasize one versus the other. We're going to be mindful that -- the reference you may have is what I mentioned about one of the big in-store Shopper Marketing events we're having with Child Hunger Ends Here, but again, that's one of our big platform bases. There's as much marketing in that as there is push tactics in terms of promotion, if you will. That's may be what you're referencing.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's what I've heard earlier. And then I just had one final one for you in -- related to the Consumer Foods. There was a comment about these -- about margin management initiatives. I was just curious if that is -- is that mix, or is that cost savings? Or is it meant to be a combination of all those factors? What does that refer to that helped the margin in the quarter?","Gary M. Rodkin","Well, I think what we've been articulating is a while back, we -- as part of our Customer Connect initiative, we developed a part of our organization in customer development that was around revenue growth management, and it was all around how do we take not only pricing architecture and look at that, how do we link more closely with our procurement arms and how we buy so that the presidents are really taking a look at, holistically, at our whole margin management? And it's putting all those disciplines together, if you will, and it\u2019s been something we -- a journey, Chris, we've been on for quite some time now, and having seen the very positive effects in the business this year and tail end of last year.","Operator","And we'll talk move now to Greg Hessler with Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a question on the contribution of the milling business. The $400 million of expected monetization there, is that included in your $1.5 billion of total debt reduction number by the end of 2015, or is it incremental to that?","John F. Gehring","This is John, Greg. I would expect that will be incremental. The proceeds we use there to pay down debt will be incremental to our target.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then more like $1.9 billion. Can you also just talk about -- so after the close of the quarter, that's when the private placements came out? So can you tell us what your debt -- what your total debt number was after the close of the quarter after that action?","John F. Gehring","I don't have that in front -- I want to say it might be around $10 billion, but -- it would be just south of $10 billion. I don't have the exact numbers in front of us -- in front of me, but yes, so that would be the case. And obviously, we had a lot of cash that was sitting on the balance sheet, and so that last transaction you referred to was kind of the final transaction to complete the financing plans. So it just happened the day after the end of the quarter.","Chris Klinefelter","And this is Chris. It was something in the mid-500s  was immediately reduced. So you're ...","John F. Gehring","That's correct. It was about $560 million.","Operator","And there are no further questions. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release, and we're available for discussions.

And welcome to today\u2019s ConAgra Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This program is being recorded. My name is Candice Scriven, and I will be your conference facilitator. All audience lines are currently in a listen only mode. However, our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation, during the formal question-and-answer session.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today\u2019s program, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; John Gehring, Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Klinefelter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Klinefelter.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today\u2019s remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our Company\u2019s direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So, if you\u2019d like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I\u2019ll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which includes cautionary language.","Also, we\u2019ll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, Q&A or on our website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2016 earnings. As you saw in our earnings release, we delivered another positive quarter as results exceeded our expectations with comparable EPS of $0.68, up from $0.59 in the prior year.","Yesterday was my one-year anniversary as Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. And I can tell you, I am pleased with what we are accomplishing. Clearly, it\u2019s been an active year as we\u2019ve methodically taken the necessary steps to help ConAgra start to unlock the value opportunity that I saw so clearly when I first started thinking about taking this job. Simply put, we are driving focus and discipline into the Company and the impact can be seen not only in our P&L, but also in our culture, where our team is energized, optimistic and determined about the path ahead. And while we\u2019re pleased with our progress over the past year, we\u2019re also clear-eyed that there is much more to do. Accordingly, our team remains hard at work on executing our plans to build a stronger, more consistent and more valuable ConAgra Foods.","Before John and I get into the details of our Q3 results, I want to take a step back and provide you with my perspective on where we are relative to our strategic plans. In February, we completed the sale of our private label operations to TreeHouse Foods, marking the conclusion of a robust sale process. The sale enables us to sharpen our focus on our consumer and commercial businesses and it provides us with meaningful capital. We\u2019ve already deployed $2.15 billion of the proceeds to reduce debt and going forward as part of a balanced capital allocation program, we plan to pursue further debt reduction. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the sale also provided a sizeable tax benefit, which can be used in the future.","In addition to completing the sale of our private label operations, we have been hard at work at strengthening the foundation of our two businesses. We\u2019re executing our $300 million efficiency plan, primarily within consumer to build ConAgra into a lean, more focused Company. We are confident this effort will improve profitability, advance our growth agenda, and unlock shareholder value.","As we\u2019ve said previously, we expect to realize the majority of our efficiency improvements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. We also remain on track to bring our consumer and corporate leadership teams together under one roof at our new headquarters in Chicago this summer. I\u2019m excited about our plans to develop a more open physical space that will facilitate collaboration and accelerate our shift to a leaner, more nimble, innovative, and performance oriented culture.","Finally, we remain on track to complete the separation of ConAgra into two public companies in the fall of calendar 2016. As we said when we announced the proposed spin-off, our goal is to enable both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston to operate as vibrant pure-play companies with enhanced strategic focus and flexibility. I\u2019ll talk more in a moment about the progress we\u2019re making in each of these businesses, but let me reiterate that when you take all factors into consideration, we believe the separation of ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston is the right path to maximize value as we expect shareholders to benefit from better operating performance and more consistency from both businesses following the separation.","As you know, there is a lot of work to complete between the announcement of a proposed spin and the separation itself. We\u2019re hard at work on that front and we will have a lot of more information to share via SEC filings and investor days over time. Ultimately, our ability to drive value across these businesses is a function of how well we execute. To that end, our solid Q3 results exceeded our expectations and give me confidence that we\u2019re identifying the right actions to drive improved profitability.","So on to Q3 in detail. Our Q3 results for the Consumer Foods segment reflect continued progress and momentum around establishing a higher quality investment grade volume base. Even though we experienced the volume decline, we had strong price mix during the quarter. We\u2019ve been implementing initiatives to improve pricing discipline and trade efficiencies while driving renovation and targeted brand investments. Importantly, as we undertake these actions, we remained relentlessly focused on execution. We\u2019re making good progress on all these fronts.","From a top line prospective, we saw volume declines where we expected them. The vast majority of the Q3 consumer volume decline was on Banquet, 90% to be exact. But more broadly, in the second half of last fiscal year, we funded several major deep discount promotions, particularly in our frozen business.","These kinds of deals can drive big spikes in low margin promoted volume. And given are deliberate plan to reduce our reliance on deep discount promotions and given the promoted volumes like embedded in our year ago comps, we expected lower promoted volume. What we were counting on though was solid performance on most base consumption trends and strong margin expansion broadly and that is basically what we got. You see the entire segment\u2019s margin expansion in the release but it is important to note that on Banquet we saw over 200 basis points of gross margin expansion despite investments in higher quality. Further, we also made other below the line investments to build the brand the right way for the long haul, namely A&P support. These collective investments do not have the same immediate impact of promoted price points below a dollar but they represent the right way to manage a branded asset for long-term value creation.","This notion has been missing for too long at ConAgra. We\u2019ll be relentless as we continue these efforts because at the end of the day, we want sustainably stronger margins, which require strong brands; and strong brands don\u2019t compete on the back of giveaway deals.","As a result of our efforts, on a comparable basis, operating profit was $340 million, up about 17%. Operating margins were up more than 300 basis points from the year ago period driven by these three factors, price mix; supply chain productivity; and modest material deflation.","Our focus in Consumer Foods will continue to be on expanding margins. The cornerstone of this effort is strengthening the brand that generates the best return. By focusing on our strongest brands, we\u2019re getting better price realization and trade efficiencies.","As you\u2019ve heard us discuss before, our approach provides the fuel to reinvest in brands that have the right fundamentals, are consumer relevant, and have accretive margins. And we\u2019re not just talking about investments, during the third quarter we supported our brands in a highly disciplined way as evidenced by our 12% increase in A&P support. We\u2019ve increased A&P spending 13% year-to-date. We\u2019ve been investing in brands with clear differentiators and relevant consumer benefits like Marie Callender\u2019s, Hunt\u2019s, RO*TEL, Reddi-wip, Slim Jim and PAM.","I\u2019ll talk in a moment about our efforts in the frozen category but in the center of the store, we continue to make good progress with our real food initiative around the Hunt\u2019s brand and we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making with RO*TEL, which delivered very strong results during the Super Bowl. In addition, through focused execution, we increased sales, built share and won the holiday season across Marie Callender\u2019s pies, Reddi-wip and PAM.","Our investments are also coming in the form of innovation and renovation. As you heard me discuss, we intend to continue enhancing our portfolio with the focus on further premiumization, wellness, and authenticity. We expect to achieve this through a combination of organic innovation and smart acquisitions.","A great example of our investment in innovation comes from our Healthy Choice Simply Steamers line, which you heard us discuss previously. This is a clean label, nothing artificial version of our Caf\u00e9 Steamers offering, and we\u2019re continuing to drive wellness based innovation with this line. In the fourth quarter, we\u2019re adding four new premium varieties including three cheese tortellini, a sweet and spicy Asian style noodle bowl, creamy spinach and tomato linguine, and an unwrapped burrito bowl. Consistent with the consumer focus on authenticity these new recipes will spotlight organic, non-GMO ingredients. ","Renovation will also be a driver of margin expansion, building on an example we touched upon last quarter, our work to restage the Banquet franchise continues. As I noted earlier, Banquet represented the vast majority of our volume decline in the third quarter, as we reduced our reliance on deep discount promotions and raised our everyday shelf price above $1.","While we recognize it will take time to rebuild the buying rate among households that are long accustomed to $1 Banquet, we\u2019re confident that the higher price points enable us to invest in product enhancements and higher quality A&P that reeducates consumers about the brand. Not all consumers will transition with the brand and we\u2019re okay with that. But given the higher quality, we expect to attract new consumers to the franchise in time. We continue to believe our plan for Banquet is the right one for its long-term brand health and financial strength. And this highly disciplined approach to margin expansion is one we plan to methodically apply to other brands with similar opportunities.","Another primary staging candidate is Bertolli, which we see as right for the same type of targeted investment. With Bertolli, we are stepping up our work to renovate our frozen skillet business and make the brand even more relevant to today\u2019s shoppers. We\u2019re expanding occasions through the addition of Family Size Skillets within our lineup. And looking ahead, we are embarking on major renovation investments in the Bertolli brand to upgrade proteins, such as all natural chicken and dramatically simplify the ingredient label. As we continue to renovate around the brand, we will support the product upgrades with increased marketing spend to drive profitable growth.","As I\u2019ve said many times, unlocking the full value potential of our branded portfolio will be a process, not a flip of the switch. But it is a battle tested process and it will succeed. It all starts with the unwavering belief that strong margins are the key to maximizing value and that strong margins are the byproduct of executional excellence across disciplines, spanning everything from supply chain productivity to pricing and trade analytics to mix management and targeted high ROI marketing to exciting innovation. Make no mistake about it, ConAgra is becoming much stronger in each of these disciplines and you are seeing the impact in our margin expansion. Over time, as we wean ourselves off of our historical overreliance on deep discount trade deals and rebuild our innovation pipeline supported by more effective marketing, you will see sales grow but in a much higher quality fashion.","We are confident that there is a lot of room for progress and we are relentlessly focused on continuing to execute against our goals. It is about the delta, meaning the change we can drive as opposed to a snapshot assessment.","Overall, I\u2019m very encouraged by the work going on in Consumer Foods. Investment creates a virtuous cycle. Over time, stronger brands will lead the better pricing power and higher margins, and we are clearly on the right path to maximizing value.","Now, turning to Commercial Foods, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, up 6% compared to the prior year. The Commercial Foods segment\u2019s operating profit was a $175 million, up 21% on a comparable basis. While the Commercial Foods segment posted strong results across the board, Lamb Weston was particularly strong.","Sales for Lamb Weston\u2019s potato operations grew across North America during the quarter as well as in international markets. International sales performance for Lamb Weston was noticeably strong, reflecting the lapping of the impact of the West Coast port labor dispute in the year ago period as well as improving demand in key Asian markets. As we\u2019ve indicated before, Lamb Weston remains well-positioned to capitalize on the significant international growth opportunities created by the aggressive emerging market expansion of major quick service restaurant chains. In our Lamb Weston North America business, we continue to see positive growth momentum across many of our key customers in the quick serve restaurant and operator distributor channels. We have industry leading innovations and customer service and our breadth of diversified products continues to position this business as a clear market leader in North America.","Now, before I turn it over to John, I want to take a moment to acknowledge our talented team as we work to transform ConAgra into a stronger, more consistent Company with a more valuable future. While there has been significant change during the past year, our people are energized and focused on serving our customers, and I\u2019m excited about the path forward.","Over to you, John.","John Gehring","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I will address several topics including a recap of our fiscal third quarter performance including discontinued operations, comparability matters, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year.","I\u2019ll start with some comments on our performance for our fiscal third quarter. Overall, diluted EPS from continuing operations as reported was $0.41. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, diluted EPS for the fiscal third quarter including discontinued operations was $0.68, which is ahead of our expectations and compares favorably to our prior year quarter\u2019s comparable earnings per share of $0.59.","Both our Consumer Foods and our Commercial Foods segments performed very well. In our Consumer Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.9 billion for the quarter, down about 2% from the year ago period. This reflects a 4% decline in volume and a negative 1% impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by a 3% improvement in price mix. Segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability were $339 million or up about 17% from the year ago period. Operating margin on a comparable basis expanded about 300 basis points versus the year ago quarter. Margin expansion reflects pricing discipline, mix management, supply chain efficiencies, and favorable input costs offset by higher marketing and incentive costs.","Foreign exchange this quarter had negative impact of $28 million on net sales and about $12 million on operating profit. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $91 million, up about 12% from the prior year quarter, reflecting our efforts to continue to strengthen and support our brands.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.1 billion, up about 6% from the prior year quarter. The Commercial Foods segment operating profit was $175 million, or 21% above last year\u2019s third quarter operating profit. The operating results largely reflect a strong profit increase in our Lamb Weston business, driven by strong volume performance, both domestically and internationally, margin expansion, and the benefit of lapping the West Coast port labor dispute in the year ago quarter.","Equity method investment earnings, excluding the impact -- excluding items impacting comparability, were $27 million for the quarter and $33 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture, principally driven by unfavorable weak market conditions, which, from time-to-time, can impact margins.","Moving on to the corporate expenses, for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $155 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $73 million versus $52 million in the year ago quarter. The increase principally relates to higher incentives, reflecting the significant improvement in operating performance this year, and the timing of the related incentive accruals year-over-year.","On our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making good progress and expect to see significant benefits over the next couple of years. I would note that our fiscal third quarter results from continuing operations reflects some initial benefits from our cost savings programs, partially offset by modest stranded cost from our private label divestiture.","Further, I would highlight two other points related to our cost savings initiatives; first, the benefits of our previously announced cost savings programs are concentrated in the consumer business; and second, we have developed aggressive targets and plans so that we can offset modest stranded costs as they arrive, as well as selectively invest back into the business to build capabilities that will expand operating margins over time.","Discontinued operations posted EPS of $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. It reflects operations of the private label business through February 1, 2016, or about 9 weeks of the fiscal quarter. After adjusting for items impacting comparability, the private label discontinued operations earned $0.11 per share this quarter, including about $0.05 per share of benefits related to the elimination of depreciation and amortization expense. Expected comparable earnings from the private label operations were included in our earlier guidance for the quarter.","Also, at this time, we estimate that the divestiture of the private label operations gave rise to a capital loss of approximately $4.2 billion pretax or $1.6 billion after tax, which can be utilized over the next five years. We remain confident that the Company will be able to realize significant tax benefits in the future as we work to reshape our portfolio in a disciplined manner.","On comparability items, this quarter included four items; first, approximately $0.16 per share of net expense related to restructuring charges; second, approximately $0.04 per share of net expense related to transaction costs incurred in connection with debt reduction this quarter; third, approximately $0.03 per share of income related to a pension settlement gain at a joint venture; and finally, we included incomparable earnings of approximately $0.11 per share of income related to items in discontinued operations for which we have provided additional details in our Regulation G disclosures in the release.","On cash flow, capital, and balance sheet items, we ended the quarter with $503 million in cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total operating cash flows through the fiscal third quarter were approximately $695 million versus $740 million in the year ago quarter. The decrease is principally driven by higher tax payments in the current fiscal year. As a reminder, due to the seasonality in our business and our normal inventory cycle, we typically generate a significant portion of our annual operating cash flows in the latter part of the fiscal year.","We remain confident in our ability to generate attractive operating cash flows over the balance of this fiscal year and expect total operating cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations to be in the range of $1.2 billion for the year.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $100 million versus $83 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $77 million in the fiscal third quarter versus $80 million in the year ago quarter. And dividends, for this fiscal quarter, were $109 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.","On capital allocation, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases, and additional growth investments. As we previously noted, we completed the divestiture of our private label operations this quarter. We received proceeds in excess of $2.6 billion and deployed about $2.15 billion to repay long-term debt. We expect to deploy the majority of the remaining proceeds for debt repayment over the next several months. During the fiscal third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and we have approximately $132 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.","Now, I would like to provide a few comments on the balance of fiscal 2016. Given that we have sold the private label operations, we are now citing guidance in terms of earnings per share from continuing operations. We have given you the quarterly and annual details of EPS from continuing operations for this fiscal year and last fiscal year in our Regulation G tables and in our written Q&A documents.","For the full fiscal year 2016, we expect EPS from continuing operations adjusted for items impacting comparability to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.07, this compares with $1.93 for fiscal year 2015 on that same basis. So far in fiscal 2016, we have earned $1.56 from continuing operations after adjusting for items impacting comparability items. To reach our full year guidance, we are expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable EPS to be in the range of $0.50.","This guidance reflects continued strong fundamentals in our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments. This guidance is lower than the prior year comparable amount of $0.55 and the decrease is due mainly to the extra week in the prior year, the impact of FX, higher marketing investments, and higher incentives this year.","I\u2019ll also note the guidance for fiscal 2016 EPS from continuing operations should not be taken as a beginning point on which to make fiscal 2017 estimates for either ConAgra brands or Lamb Weston, as there are several details that we need to finalize including capital allocation and financial policies, the phasing of our SG&A savings and trade efficiency benefits, brand investment targets as well as the short term impact of any stranded costs associated with the Lamb Weston spin-off. We will offer details on those items in due course at the investor day events we plan to hold ahead of the spin.","In closing, while we are working through a great deal of change, we are pleased with our performance so far this fiscal year in strengthening margins across our businesses and in managing the significant changes in cost structure and portfolio that we believe will drive value creation over time.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner will be happy to take your questions. Before we turn it over for questions, Chris would like to share a few remarks. Chris?","Chris Klinefelter","Thanks John. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I want to take a minute to update our listeners on investor relations here at ConAgra Foods.","As pretty much everyone knows, our Company is moving its headquarters to Chicago and a lot of you have asked me personally if I am moving to Chicago. And while the decision to move to Chicago is best for the Company and its future, it has come with some changes on the people side of things for all the reasons that you would expect; family, stage of carrier and a host of other elements that play a part in evaluating major moves.","Along those lines, I am not relocating to Chicago. I\u2019ll be transitioning out of ConAgra Foods over the next few months, but I\u2019ll still be your point of contact until we have all of the IR resources in place with the new organization. I have worked with many of you for more than a decade and a half and gotten to know several of you well. As well my more than 16 years at ConAgra Foods had me in the mix of plenty of the Company\u2019s ups and downs, it\u2019s been very satisfying to play a part in helping advance the Company\u2019s mission. Looking back on all of this, I tremendously value the relationships that have come with the job. And I am thankful for the personal growth opportunities that have come with serving more the 16 years in this capacity. I will certainly miss the day-to-day interaction with great people inside and outside of this Company. And I want to emphasize that I feel very good about what the future holds for this organization, given its leadership and its mission.","Sean Connolly","Chris, I appreciate that and I appreciate your 16 years of service at our Company. You have been an important part of our team and we wish you continued success in the future. So, thank you and best wishes.","And with that operator, let\u2019s open it up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, I would like to get to an important part of today\u2019s call, taking your questions. [Operator Instruction] And it looks like our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Chris, I want to wish you all the best moving forward and thank you for your help over the years.","Chris Klinefelter","Thanks.","Andrew Lazar","Yes, sure. Two quick questions from me; I think first, Sean, at Hillshire, you had focused much of your effort on really raising what you would call the center line profitability of the business. As input cost moves can play with margins in any given period of time and we certainly know that deflation among other things is helping sort of industry right now, but I guess most important, where do you see the center line consumer margin now, given your reported consumer margin this quarter is really as high as I think I have seen it how and how high can that move going forward? And I\u2019ve got just a quick follow-up.","Sean Connolly","I\u2019d say, Andrew, I am very pleased with our progress obviously and in no way is our work done. Clearly, there is some benefit in our margins from the absence of inflation but that is far from the whole story. We absolutely cannot discount the benefit of increased discipline across the margin expansion levers that we talked about earlier, things like pricing; trade; productivity; mix; stronger brands. We do expect the center line of our profitability to go north over time. We also expect that the standard deviation around that center line will decrease over time. And you are absolutely right, in any given quarter, margins could be impacted by short-term inflation or deflation. And what I would say is you won\u2019t see you get overly exercise by that because we will stay focused on what\u2019s right for the long haul. But yes, there is some benefit in there from the absence of deflation but our work is not done; we see further opportunities, and that\u2019s why we are going to be relentless in pursuing.","Andrew Lazar","Okay, thanks for that. And then I think John\u2019s comments around being careful not to maybe use fiscal 2016 as necessarily the right or on appropriate base for thinking about 2017 earnings and you mentioned a number of things that could little impact things. I guess I\u2019m trying to get a little bit more color on that. And if is it -- this is kind of a sense of sort of kicking a reset year so to speak, given maybe the need around brand investment to kind of prime the pump on a lot of these things or am I reading too much into that? And then one of the items you did not mention as a possible impact also would be maybe portfolio offering here and there. So, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, I guess I had a sense of what your comment was trying to imply but I want to get little more color on that if I could.","John Gehring","I think couple of thoughts. A lot of this just has to do with we\u2019ve got work to do to make sure that we finish our analysis and have a good view of the year and finish our planning process, so we can provide our investors and analysts the right information around those drivers. On the brand and the brand investment targets, let me come back to that. I would see on the portfolio, again, we are not going to speculate on anything there, but clearly, we think there are going to be opportunities for us to change this portfolio going forward. We would share those impacts certainly if and when then come about. ","On the brand investment targets, specifically that you mentioned, I might turn it over to Tom for a few comments but we are going to continue to make the right investments in our business behind the brand. So, I think it\u2019s really about how do we do that with discipline. And as we finished our plan, those numbers could go up or they could stay flat or it could come down a little bit. But I may turn it over to Tom just to reiterate kind of what our philosophy is around how we are going to invest behind these brands in a discipline way.","Sean Connolly","Let me jump in first John. To your question, Andrew, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into John\u2019s comments in terms of where we are going to be. We obviously have a lot of communication with investors upcoming at our respective investor days for ConAgra Brands and for Lamb Weston. And our plan all along has been to get into some of the great detail at that point in time. Obviously it will be after our 10 filings et cetera. We also are going to our typical annual operating plan process. So, we\u2019re evaluating where we want to invest, the magnitude of those investments. All of that is a work in process. And the numbers will continue to get lock up here in the months ahead. And as that happens, we will have a more definitive view on where to go here. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it beyond that at this point. Tom, do you like to add to that?","Tom McGough","Sure. I think just principally, we believe in investing in brands, but doing it in a very disciplined way with the strong ROI mentality. We\u2019ve talked about segmenting our portfolio so that we\u2019re investing behind the best opportunities and this notion of brands being A&P ready. Our investments are earned, they are not an entitlement. And while we don\u2019t have a targeted spending level for the entire portfolio, we look at each individual brand, based on the segmentation and readiness for investment. I think you see that in our results today where our A&P is concentrated on a focused group of brands like Marie Callender\u2019s, Hunt\u2019s, Slim Jim, and Reddi-wip. You see that we\u2019re growing sales and share, and they are contributing to overall improvement of our portfolio margins. So, our intent is to continue to invest to grow through renovation and increased marketing over time. That\u2019s our approach, and our results in this quarter are an indication of that.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll move now to David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning. I\u2019d like to say thanks to Chris Klinefelter. Chris has fantastic; he\u2019s been terrific to us. So, best wishes in all your future endeavors. I wanted to ask a question about the implied fourth quarter guidance. This $0.50 number, consensus is out there at like $0.57. You\u2019re gaining some factors in terms of kind of maybe why it\u2019s weaker but I\u2019d just like to go a little deeper here. I mean the third quarter margins, they are pretty terrific. If these margins carry forward into the fourth quarter and you would be way above that kind of number, so obviously you are not -- it\u2019s not going to happen as implied by your number but can you talk to us why? Why does the Commercial Foods margin go down so much, why would Consumer Foods margins go down so much when you are in such a clear positive environment of margin improvement through, both net deflation and then all the other levers that you are pulling, Sean?","John Gehring","Yes. Let me jump in, Dave, on a couple of factors just to address them. So, one thing I would remind folks is that especially in our Consumer Foods business last year in the fourth quarter, we put through a pretty strong quarter. So, we\u2019re lapping a stronger quarter relatively speaking. The other thing is we do have some seasonality in our business in terms of the mix of products we sell in our consumer business, which impacts the margins. So, when you look at sequential margins from third quarter to fourth quarter, you should expect to see the seasonality mix impact come down some. And I think we\u2019re still looking at some margin expansion year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","So, I don\u2019t think the trends are reversing or significantly flattening out. I really view it as again a number of these mechanical issues, in particular the 53rd week, some FX, so, higher incentives and then we\u2019re going to continue to have some higher marketing investment. So, that\u2019s kind of how we see it right now. And again, I don\u2019t think we see any significant breaks in the trend on Lamb Weston business either.","David Driscoll","And just a follow-up, John, can you quantify the effect of this inflationary environment in the productivity? I mean by our math, it would be something like a $0.10 benefit to the quarter, because of lower commodities and the normal productivity that the Company produces. Is that about the right neighborhood to be in?","John Gehring","Well, let me just share a few numbers; I haven\u2019t converted them all at cents yet. But, I think productivity was about $30 million in the Consumer segment. Net inflation -- or net deflation all-in was about $20 million. In addition, we are lapping about $20 million hit we took last third quarter, because of the derivative matter that you all may recall. So, I think those are kind of the drivers of the COGS, if you will. So that\u2019s why it gets you in that range.","Operator","Next, we have J.P. Morgan\u2019s Ken Goldman.","Ken Goldman","I\u2019m sorry to continue on the same line, but if your margin expands year-on-year in the fourth quarter, you\u2019re going to get something like $400 million in operating income. I don\u2019t know where your sales are going to be unless they really collapse. That implies an EPS number well above what you\u2019re guidance to. So, I guess my question is, you haven\u2019t provided EPS guidance for the year, but I think it\u2019s really important to get guidance [ph] rather, I think it\u2019s really important to get a sense what you\u2019re thinking for this line item. We\u2019re backing into what we think for the year\u2019s operating income; we\u2019re looking at something in the mid $1.5 billion range. Is that a reasonable figure to consider or am I way off there?","John Gehring","You\u2019re probably not way off, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Okay.","John Gehring","Again, I think, we feel good about what we said here and how we look at the fourth quarter. And there again are some significant matters we\u2019ve got to deal with after we look at how we think the business is going to continue to perform pretty well.","Ken Goldman","Okay. And then shifting subject, Sean, I\u2019m sure, all my peers have done this as well. We\u2019ve all been talking to investors about the spin-off of Lamb Weston. Just from my perspective, most investors I speak with would rather you sell the business than spin it. And maybe I\u2019m not talking to the right people and of course I don\u2019t know if there is any actually any buyers out there. So, maybe this is a moot [ph] question. But to what degree, I\u2019m just curious, are you feeling pressure if any from your largest holders to maybe monetize Lamb in a different way?","Sean Connolly","Well, I think we\u2019ve talked about this quite a bit, Ken. And from the beginning and as always, our focus is on maximizing value. And as we think about maximizing value, you should expect that we\u2019re going to consider just about every option that you can dream up and then we will add into the analysis, all the information we know about our business and all the information we know about whether or not somebody\u2019s an interested party. And our conclusion, as a management team and a Board, having looked at our options is that the spin is clearly the best way to maximize value here. And that\u2019s our goal. All of this has been considered.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move now to Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning, everyone. And Chris, best of luck to you as well.","Chris Klinefelter","Thanks Matthew.","Matthew Grainger","So, I guess one follow-up just on Lamb Weston, I mean the magnitude of top-line growth in the Commercial Foods segment was surprising, even with the benefit of lapping the port disruption last year. Could you remind us whether those tailwinds will continue a bit further into the fourth quarter? And then in terms of your comments on improving international demand, can you elaborate a bit on where are you seeing improvement and how sustainable you think that might be?","Tom Werner","Sure Matthew, this is Tom Werner. I will tell you a couple of things, as you think about our Commercial segment. The good news is across all of our business units in the Commercial segment, we grew year-over-year. So, while Lamb Weston was obviously disproportionately, a lion\u2019s share of that, the rest of the operating units performed well as well. I think in terms of capturing international growth and domestic growth, the business, as I\u2019ve said before, is well-positioned. We\u2019re aligned with the great customer base across, both North America domestic and international. We feel good about the momentum we have in the business through the first three quarters and we see this momentum carrying into Q4 and into fiscal \u201817.","So, we feel great about the business. It\u2019s a fantastic business; it\u2019s performed great this year; and we expect that to continue going forward.","Matthew Grainger","Sean, if I could ask you one question, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the consumption trends at the broader industry level. In the past two months, we\u2019ve seen retail take rate that looks incredibly soft in February and recovered a bit in March but was benefiting from Easter timing. So, from your standpoint just curious if there was any major change in trend or slowdown at the industry level?","Sean Connolly","Well, I think from our standpoint, I -- clearly, a good part of what you\u2019re seeing is really what\u2019s embedded in the base. I mean we saw -- you saw the consumption data back in February didn\u2019t look particularly pretty for us. That was as much of a function of being very aggressive in terms of deep discounted promotion in a year ago period and choosing not to do it this year, as well the fact that you\u2019ve got some baseline -- the base driver elasticity because we\u2019ve raised price on a number of businesses. Obviously, you saw that that was kind of a short-term effect because of the last consumption that was just released kind of showed that bounce back. So, look, growth has been allusive in our industry, it\u2019s why we are so focused on innovation, it is why we\u2019re so focused on margin expansion and efficiency, and we absolutely plan on expanding margins going in the future and we plan on improving our growth trends the right way as we continue to unfold this plan.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","Kevin Lehmann","Hi, good morning; Kevin Lehmann here for David Palmer. Quick question on Commercial Foods and perhaps building on Kens\u2019 question a bit but perhaps from a higher level. Can you expand on the strategic rationale behind spinning off Lamb Weston? On the case of private label, already that business can be viewed as a distraction to core U.S. retail but many other food periods have food services division. So, how would say ConAgra differs from others in that regard? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","I\u2019ll take that. We have a traditional food service division that we\u2019ll retain as part of ConAgra Brands which is really to what we referenced in our peer set. So that will carry on and it won\u2019t be -- that was a business that had a good quarter this quarter as well and that will continue to be part of our branded business, because it\u2019s incredibly intertwined, think of large sizes of food service packages of the stuff that we sell in the retail channel tray. In the case of Lamb Weston, it is a focused, largely disintegrated business. And we believe that by being a pure play and being focused, it will continue to not only perform well but perform better. And it is very, very different from our traditional food service business which is really what you described as being embedded in our peer set. ","Operator","We\u2019ll now hear from Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Sean, I wanted to dig into the reception at retail, and at retailers and versus your expectation with consumers to this pricing up strategy. I know a lot of centre store package food companies are pursuing this pricing up strategy, particularly you mentioned the Banquet brand, an important brand, a lot of consumers seeking value. Are retailers -- I guess the trends and the profits are coming through great but is there a risk or are you getting pushed back from retailers, maybe losing space, losing attention to the category, anything like that, particularly at a time when costs broadly are deflationary and may be things around the perimeter of the store are -- they are not going up and prices are coming down? Just your general impressions of that, high level reaction, the consumer versus your expectations and the conversations you have with the retailers?","Sean Connolly","I\u2019m very glad to answer this question, because I think it\u2019s important to demystify what we are doing and what we\u2019re not doing with respect to average pricing. Keep in mind, average pricing is a function of shelf price or our list price, but it\u2019s also a function of our promoted volume price. And we\u2019ve actually been active on both fronts. I think with respect to merchandising and a $100 million efficiency that we talk about within trade, sometimes what I read is that it sounds as if that\u2019s coming across as if it\u2019s just a cut, as if we\u2019re ripping trade out, that nothing could be farther from the truth. We spend a lot of money on trades, we\u2019ve identified a $100 million in trade spend that we don\u2019t think does much to help us or our retailers.","So, when we talk to our customers about being more efficient and impactful with that trade, they\u2019re as interested in that as we are because it helps drive quality sales, it helps drive margins et cetera. And then separately, I\u2019d say, our customers also value quality volume as much as we do. They understand that inefficiency isn\u2019t helping anybody. So, if we can redeploy inefficiency into brand building, innovation or even more effective merchandising, everybody wins. So, think of the payoff as better margins and stronger brands versus cutting merchandising.","Then, when it comes to shelf price, there are three pillars to our pricing actions. Number one is what we call inflation justified list price increases, meaning if we got inflation we feel totally justified in taking a list price increase and that\u2019s we\u2019ll do. The second piece of pricing is the trade efficiency we just talked about which in large part means, reduced reliance on deep discount merchandising and redeployment of those funds toward more effective, more efficient activities. And then the third piece of our pricing strategy is higher quality driven pricing, meaning we improve the food we\u2019re selling and we charge more for it. And in any given quarter, we\u2019re likely to have a mix of all three of these things, but the ratios could change within each quarter. So that is this strategy that we\u2019re pursuing. Our customers are aligned with us on it, they\u2019re supportive on it, they believe as we believe, it\u2019s ultimately going to lead to better sales, better profit than a higher quality volume base.","Operator","Next we have Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everybody and Chris, all the best to you. I guess just two questions, one just a point of clarification. I think, John, you\u2019d said there was $30 million of productivity in the quarter. Was that gross or net productivity?","John Gehring","We measured all net.","Bryan Spillane","All net, okay. And then I guess the second just as a follow-up to I think it was Ken Goldman\u2019s question about the decision to sort of split or spin off Lamb Weston. As we kind of think about the value of that also in relation to having the tax credit that you have, is it right to think about the value not just of Lamb Weston but also in the context of what other optionality there exists because you\u2019ve got that tax credit to potentially do other things with? So, I guess I\u2019m trying to say is the way it works we should be thinking about the value creation potential more than just one step with Lamb Weston but maybe the potential to use that asset to do other things?","John Gehring","Yes, the way I think about it is, not having value destruction through tax leakage is a good thing and having a tax asset that you can deploy in the future as we think about reshaping our portfolio to be more contemporary, higher margin, higher performing, is a good thing. Now clearly, the tax asset is one of the tools we can leverage in that reshaping process. I won\u2019t speculate on when that could happen, I\u2019ll just say that we\u2019ll do what makes sense for the long term value creation potential of the company.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jefferies\u2019 Akshay Jagdale.","Lubi Kutua","Good morning, this is Lubi filling in for Akshay. I\u2019m wondering, could you give us a sense of how much cost savings initiatives contributed to the margin expansion that we had in Consumer Foods this quarter?","John Gehring","We\u2019re not going to provide specific numbers. I would say we have some modest early delivery from our cost savings program. I would also say a chunk of that was offset by some modest stranded costs that came back into the consumer business. So, I\u2019d say net-net that wasn\u2019t a huge driver of the margin expansion; it was more at the gross margin line.","Sean Connolly","As we said before that the bulk of the savings we\u2019re going to generate through our programs hits in \u201817 and \u201818. One of the reasons why we don\u2019t want you to start building a model necessarily right now is we\u2019re in the process of pinning down exactly how much of that\u2019s going to hit in \u201817 versus \u201818 as we continue to morph our organization design and things like that. So, a little bit of benefit now but the bulk is coming in the next couple of years.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll hear now from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thanks for the opportunity to ask question. And let me echo the sentiment from others; Chris, it\u2019s been great working with you, good luck on the next venture.","I thought Jon Feeney had a very sound line of question I want to build on a little bit. In response to his question on trade budget optimization, you referenced to as more of a shell game to optimize efficiency, and I guess my question is why. You\u2019re squeezing SG&A, you\u2019re trying to squeeze COGS through productivity and here\u2019s roughly a $2 billion expense line on your P&L. Why does it need to be a shell game, why can\u2019t you shrink it?","Sean Connolly","Jason, I think you might have called into a different call, I don\u2019t remember mentioning anything to shell game. We\u2019ve got a significant spend with customers that we collaborate with very carefully and we have a zero loss mindset when it comes to analyzing that spend and partnering with our customers on how to put a red circle around funds that we think are doing little for our customers or us, and then collaborating with our customers in terms of how do you redeploy that funding to continue to support our brands and our categories in ways that are better for overall volume trends and overall margins. So, there\u2019s waste there; we\u2019re going to be as aggressive as anybody in the industry in terms of getting after that waste. And we\u2019ll be open-minded with when we identify waste -- where it goes. If we\u2019ve got a high ROI way of redeploying it, we will redeploy it; if we don\u2019t have a high ROI way of redeploying it, we\u2019ll drop it right to the bottom line. We\u2019ll be very pragmatic around what to do in the lieu of waste based on what maximizes value.","Operator","And next we have Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman","Thank you, good morning. Chris, best of luck. I guess, Sean, I wanted to ask a little bit more about Banquet and its, what seems like a really big impact for the brand on the consolidated. If it\u2019s 90% of the volume hit, the elasticity by going over $1 dollar must have been really-really significant, and I understand why you\u2019re doing it. But I guess my question is as you kind of move through the rest of the portfolio, should we expect similar levels of elasticity as you try to make your promotion more efficient or is it a function of as you improve the product, eventually get into consumer to recognize that but it just seemed like a very big drop on one brand. Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Yes, Eric, great question and it\u2019s important that we demystify that. I think Banquet is quite a big different from our other brands, and I am going to have Tom kind of share some of our detailed thinking on this business. But the impact you see on Banquet is, if again you come back to the notion that there are two things we are dealing with here; one is shelf price, which is baseline volume; the other is promotion strategy and that\u2019s promoted volume. We have actually made a meaningful difference, a meaningful change on both. And part of what you are seeing is how aggressive we were in the year ago period in promoted activity and the choice not to do that. For example, events that might sell at $0.80 instead of $1 dollar, as you might imagine, that drove some pretty significant spikes in the year ago period. And when you don\u2019t repeat that, obviously, you\u2019re not selling on profitable volume, but you\u2019re going to see it show up on the promoted volumes side of the volume ledger. At the same time, we also have shelf price increases which shows up as a baseline elasticity factor. So, when you get both, it kind of compounds and that\u2019s what a bit of what you saw in the results. But again, that was entirely planned. We knew what we\u2019d expect there. And we\u2019ve got to migrate to a higher quality consumer base here over time because there were clearly plenty of consumers in that exact window year-ago who were in our franchise for one reason and one reason only, and that\u2019s because we were basically doing giveaway pricing, or giveaway merchandising. And that\u2019s effectively what you saw. Tom, did I miss anything there?","Tom McGough","No. Sean, I think that really nails it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson","Thank you very much. Just a follow-up question, so all the questions have been said and asked now on the trades and opportunities. Very simplistically, Sean, I am just curious you mentioned the red circles, you draw red circles around the areas where we think we can gain efficiency and then you then redeploy back for higher ROI on those brands. Over the past, I don\u2019t know let\u2019s say, as you have done this especially on Banquet, do you think there is realistically more upside to the $100 million that you have given us and therefore there are more red circles, or there\u2019s more of an opportunity to drop some of that to the bottom line? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Rob, I\u2019ll interpret that along the lines of the question I\u2019ve received sometimes before, which is in total, its\u2019 more than 300 in our overall cost efficiency program, 200 SG&A, 100 in trade. And I think my answer before, which will remain intact today, is we\u2019re only going to look for more. If we can find any inefficiency, we are going to try to get it out, whether it\u2019s SG&A, weather it\u2019s trade. Now, today, I can tell you, we are squarely focused on hitting that 300. We are on track. We feel good about the progress we are making. And we want to make sure we don\u2019t get any slippage in that before we start getting stars in our eyes around going beyond that.","But I think philosophically and culturally, we don\u2019t view cost efficiency as a project, we view it as a way of life because it provides us fuel for investment and innovation. And it\u2019s just helps us culturally be more performance oriented. So, we are going to continue to be relentless in that. Certainly on trade, it\u2019s actually great to see the teams do it. Our teams get together as customer teams. They plan these events using significantly improved technology, post -- analytics tools, better systems. And we go through literally event by event, hundreds if not thousands of events. We know what they\u2019ve done in the past now. We\u2019ve got visibility to it. We know what we want to get rid of. We know what we want to change. We know what we want to add. And we do that by customer and it\u2019s making a meaningful difference. So, we\u2019re going to continue to work it. So, if there is more there, we will get it. We\u2019re not ready to speculate on that right now, but philosophically, that\u2019s our view.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Credit Suisse\u2019s, Robert Moskow.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. And best wishes to you, Chris. So, I guess a two-part question, the first is I understand that we don\u2019t want to use fiscal \u201816 as an EPS base. But, if I just look at operating profit in the two divisions, both had very strong years in \u201816. And I guess I am just trying to do the big picture math of -- they\u2019re both going to have pretty significant SG&A savings. The trade productivity will continue. And then that\u2019s going to be offset by some dissynergies. So, I guess just big picture, like should we expect kind of a normal year because these two things kind of trade-off against each other? Can it be an above normal year, below normal year? And maybe I am supposed to wait until the Analyst Day for all of that, but just a way to put it like a big picture format.","Sean Connolly","Rob, we\u2019re not going to get into anything that could look like guidance for next year at this point, because we are not ready to do that. Clearly, we feel very good about the direction that we are headed in terms of margin expansion, in terms of our ability to rebuild the innovation funnel. So, we are moving in the right direction, and we\u2019ll look forward to going through each of the businesses in detail and giving some detailed guidance for you, as we do these Investor Days.","Robert Moskow","Can I ask an interest expense question also? I thought interest expense will be down quite a bit more than what the guidance implies for fourth quarter and then maybe into next year. Can you give us a sense of what interest expense would look like for fiscal \u201817, John?","John Gehring","Well, let me start with the Q4. I believe interest expense is down about $20 million. Just as a reminder, we had deployed the proceeds from private a brand until fairly late in the year and then also the debt we\u2019re taking out is fairly low interest debt. So, that\u2019s both the beauty and the curse of these interest rate environments. Certainly, as we go forward next year, you can look at the full year impact of the debt we just repaid but all we don\u2019t know right now is the capital allocation around some of these other transactions that are still in progress. So, it\u2019s not possible for me at this point or responsible for me to say here is what the other interest rate impacts of some of that capital deployment is going to be. Certainly, I would think those net-net would be favorable to interest expense next year. But we just can\u2019t quantify at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. Chris, best wishes to you as well. I may echo the earlier talks there. I had just two questions, if I could. If you look at the gross margin performance, it was stronger than expected; it was very strong obviously benefitting from the absence of private brands. Could you talk about whether that was more consumer driven or commercial driven? I know consumer has a number of things that are benefitting the gross margin, was that the majority of the upside there?","And then the second question, just around you\u2019ve had some very weak IRI and Nielsen data, it was the question earlier. I am just trying to understand when I even look at some categories that I regard as sort of focus categories for ConAgra, we are seeing those -- the way to decline in those categories accelerates, and is it the matter of increased spending or maybe taking some of the tray torsion saving and reinvest those back in the business? I am trying to understand what you could do behind the focused categories, those you may focus on the future to really reignite revenue growth there?","John Gehring","Yes. Let me start on the gross margin side. We don\u2019t talk a lot about gross margin details, why, to tell you directionally is that both segments have strong gross margin increases. There was proportionally more in consumer than you get in commercial business, but both of them had strong margin expansion.","Tom McGough","Chris, this is Tom McGough. When you think about consumption performance, we break it down into two components, what\u2019s non-promoted and what\u2019s promoted. And as Sean said, in February specifically, there was a lot of noise on our numbers. What it was, was the deliberate choice not to repeat some low ROI events from the previous year. And what it wasn\u2019t, was a fundamental weakness in the foundation of the base non-promoted volume. Obviously, we\u2019ve taken price on Banquet, as Sean said, it impacted both base and promoted. When you take out Banquet and look at the rest of our portfolio, our non-promoted base sales were essentially flat. So, we are going through a period, not just our sales in terms of looking at trade productivity, investing it in the right return activities, but the customer environment is also changing. And there is a move for less promotional activity from some customers. I think inherent and what we are driving against is selling more off the shelf and relying less from push activities. So, I think that\u2019s some of the noise that you see in the most recent results, certainly ours but I think more broadly some of this has been driven by changes in customer strategies as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Elyn Rodriguez","Hey guys, good morning. This is Elyn Rodriguez on for Alexia. So, how worried are you about the impact of an introducing voluntary GMO labeling at a national level, when the GMA spent millions of dollars in recent years, so why this happening? Thanks so much.","Sean Connolly","Well, obviously our position when it comes to GMO labeling is we need a federal standard, anything else makes no such. At the end of the day, we are for the consumer and we believe in transparency but we think it\u2019s got to be done at a federal level. That said, there has not been a federal preemption and there is a law in Vermont. And we have to do what\u2019s necessary to make sure that we are in compliance. For us to carve out inventories and think we can control what goes into Vermont, is not pragmatic, it\u2019s not really doable at least with any reasonable cost. So we are in a position where we\u2019ve got to do what we\u2019ve got to do. And hopefully where we are right now is not the end of the story, there will be an evolution, there will be a federal standard and there will be a common communication strategy around this. So, ultimately that\u2019s we care most about but there is no consumer confusion, there is no unnecessary increase in cost of the foods that our consumers are buying, things like that.","Operator","And we will hear now from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Duvick","Just a quick question on the balance sheet; you have definitely been busy and you talk about additional debt reduction. So, I guess two part question, one is, should we assume that cash on hand and commercial paper will be used to take out the July maturity? And secondly, should we expect any incremental debt reduction as a function of the Lamb Weston spin?","John Gehring","Yes. So, again, as some of this gets into kind of capital allocation plans, we have to finalize. So, I don\u2019t want to get specific on exactly what we will be on the July maturity. I think if you can kind of do a math little bit, I think there is a couple of guide post I would point to. One is we continue to be committed to an investment grade credit rating on the ConAgra Brands business. Certainly what that implies is as we spin out pieces of business or otherwise change the portfolio where we would lose EBITDA, we would naturally then look to further debt reduction to make sure that our debt to EBITDA ratios are in line with what\u2019s required to be investment grade. So, I think it\u2019s a reasonable assumption that as we take pieces of business out and so off EBITDA or spin them off, it will have some additional debt reductions, but more details to come on that going forward.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I\u2019ll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. And as always, we are available for discussions.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today's program; Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Nystedt, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Nystedt.","Johan Nystedt","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter conference call. This will be our last earnings call as ConAgra Foods as we anticipate completing the Lamb Weston spin-off this fall prior to the holidays. As you've probably seen by now, we announced the timing of dedicated Investor Days for each business. Lamb Weston's will be held in New York City on October 13, and ConAgra Brands will be held on October 18 here in Chicago. Our teams are hard at work preparing for these meetings, and we are excited about the opportunity to take you through a deeper dive on these businesses and why we believe they will create significant value for investors as separate pure-play public companies. Each company will share more details, including financial outlooks and capital allocation priorities at these events. We are confident you will see the unique opportunities available to both companies and why each is well positioned to seize them.","Now on to the state of the business and our first quarter results. Once again, it was a very busy quarter at ConAgra as we continue our disciplined and methodical approach to enhancing focus, expanding margins, improving efficiency, energizing our culture and ultimately, creating value for our shareholders. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are pleased with the progress that we have made to date. At a high level, we saw strong results from both Lamb Weston and our branded consumer businesses. On Lamb, we once again saw what a terrific business this is. Sales were up, margins were up and profit was up. The team is looking forward to sharing much more about this jewel of a business on October 13.","On our branded consumer businesses, we also made terrific progress. Here, we are seeing clear evidence that our strategy to upgrade our revenue base and expand margins is working. As we have discussed previously, we are intensely focused on positioning our U.S. branded portfolio for long-term success and that starts with building a higher-quality revenue base. As we will discuss in more detail at our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we compete in good categories with many well-known brands that are Number 1 or Number 2 in their categories. However, ConAgra historically prioritized volume over value and accordingly, we've been overly reliant on deep discounting as our chief demand driver, leading us to under-invest and under-deliver on brand building and innovation. In short, we underleveraged some of our greatest assets.","The result of this behavior is a revenue base that is overdeveloped in terms of the presence of low-loyalty, price-focused consumers. The problem with catering to these consumers is that, (a) it caused us to neglect the needs of the vast majority of our consumer base, people who are hungry for innovation and premiumization and, (b) it fundamentally limited our ability to drive higher margins. We are changing that. Specifically, to ensure we leverage our brand strength and unlock our margin potential, we have been methodically infusing focus and discipline around pricing and trade promotion while investing in brand building and innovation. Said differently, we are focusing our efforts on practices that support value over volume and walking away from our previous practices that concentrated on volume over value. It is important to understand that while our efforts to improve brand building and innovation are broad-based, the volume declines we're experiencing are largely concentrated within brands that historically targeted the price-focused consumer and heavily relied on deep discounts and promotion to drive volume. In fact, if you dig into the scanner data, you will see that more than 80% of our Q1 volume declines can be attributed to just six brands that have historically been underpriced and over-promoted. We are confident that our actions represent the right way to maximize the value of our branded portfolio over time.","As a supporting data point, gross margins on our U.S. retail brands are up about 700 basis points since Q1 two years ago. As we continue to execute this strategy, we believe our revenue base will be better positioned to deliver stronger, more consistent performance over the long term. We have framed our efforts here around five portfolio management principles, or PMPs as we call them, which guide how we intend to manage our branded portfolio going forward. At our upcoming Investor Day for ConAgra Brands, we will go deep on each of these, but I want to give you a sense of our approach. PMP number 1 is upgrading the revenue base. The second PMP is refreshing the core. PMP number 3 is assigning clear portfolio roles. The fourth PMP is ramping up innovation and M&A. And the fifth PMP is effectively backing the winners. These principles represent a tried-and-true approach and in a few weeks we will discuss the progress we're making on each and how they will help build a more focused, higher-margin and higher-performing branded food company over time.","One note on PMP number 4, ramping up innovation and M&A. I'm sure you've all seen the news from earlier this week about our acquisition of the Frontera, Red Fork and Salpica brands. These businesses make authentic gourmet Mexican food and contemporary American cooking sauces. We believe this gives us another great platform to provide consumers with unique, high-quality food products. And as an extra enticement to attend our Investor Day on October 18, I promise you will have a chance to sample these tremendous brands. While we have a lot more work to do, I want to acknowledge our sales force for doing an excellent job working with our retailers to explain how our change in strategy benefits them as well as ConAgra. Similarly, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team for anticipating these volume changes and proactively offsetting any loss absorption benefits.","With that context in mind, let's turn to our Q1 results. Q1 net sales declined 5% and the impact of divestitures and FX represented about 2 percentage points of the decline. As I mentioned at the outset, Lamb Weston delivered another strong top line this quarter, offset by sales results in our domestic consumer business. In the U.S. consumer market, which, as you know, is challenged across our competitive set, we saw declines due to the actions I just outlined related to upgrading our revenue base. This, along with the impact of FX, more than offset an increase in price and mix. Overall profitability was driven by growth and margin expansion in Lamb Weston as well as continued strong gross margin expansion in our domestic consumer businesses. As a result, total segment adjusted operating profit was up 23%. Additionally, our supply chain team continues to excel at finding more efficient ways to manufacture our products and reduce costs. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.61 for the quarter, representing 49% growth from the prior year, significantly in excess of our mid to high teens growth estimate. As Dave will point out, some of this is timing related.","Now turning to segment performance. As you saw in this morning's release, we are now reporting results in five reporting segments: Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, the Refrigerated & Frozen, the International and the Foodservice segments represent the businesses that will remain with ConAgra Brands and will become the primary four reporting segments of the independent company postspin. The Commercial segment consists primarily of the Lamb Weston business. ","Starting with the Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales decreased 5% based on the actions I just discussed. These efforts, coupled with increased pricing and trade productivity, savings and supply chain and continued SG&A discipline, helped drive growth of 31% in adjusted segment operating income, which translated to a 680 basis points expansion in adjusted segment operating margin. The volume declines in this segment were largely concentrated on a few brands where we are reversing our historical practice of promoting below the $1 price point. Chef Boyardee, and Snack Pack are good examples. Importantly, we saw the margin and profit expansion that we were counting on. Equally important, key sales fundamentals like distribution remained on plan reflecting customer support for our strategy shift towards stronger brands and innovation. Keep in mind, the plan does include some important SKU rationalization. So when you see TPDs pull back in the near term, recognize that is part of a disciplined program to reduce non-value-added complexity while increasing facings and velocity on priority SKUs. You'll hear more about this at our ConAgra Brands Investor Day in Dave Biegger's supply chain presentation. ","Last point I'll make in this segment is that we continue to benefit from disciplined investment behind A&P-ready brands, such as Slim Jim and PAM among others.","Now turning to the Refrigerated & Frozen segment. Net sales decreased 8% while adjusted operating profit increased by 310 basis points to 16% of net sales. The volume decline in this segment was heavily focused on Banquet, an important brand, as you know, is going through a significant makeover. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to work to restage our Banquet brand resulting in increased pricing associated with long-overdue product and packaging upgrades. Accordingly, this was the primary driver of the volume and sales decline in the segment for the quarter. Banquet is now benefiting from much stronger margins, and our consumer data is also showing an improving buying rate from our most loyal consumers and key customers. As we move through the next calendar year and begin to wrap these actions, you will see top line sales declines moderate. From there, we will also fold in new product improvements and innovation.","Regarding segment profitability here in Q1, our disciplined pricing actions and supply chain productivity more than offset the Banquet impact and the costs related to a product recall. One other planned action in Q1 is worth noting in Frozen. While Marie Callender's is not one of our historically over-promoted brands, it was over-promoted in the year-ago period. And that was not a good business decision, so we did not repeat it in Q1 this year. These two contributed to our volume decline, but, again, we saw the margin gains we were counting on. Elsewhere in the segment, we saw solid top line performance, namely in Reddi-wip, which continues to be a strong performer for us. The International segment, net sales decreased 6% due to the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the effects of currency, segment net sales would have been approximately equal to the prior year's comparable quarter. Net sales for the Foodservice segment decreased 1%, and adjusted operating profit decreased 10% to $24 million. This segment was negatively affected by normalization of egg prices after last year's avian influenza outbreak.","Overall, the four segments that will primarily comprise ConAgra Brands' ongoing operation postspin have made good progress, demonstrating the strength of our plan and the opportunity that lies ahead. Much of our team have completed their first full quarter in our new headquarters in Chicago, at the Merchandise Mart, and there is tremendous energy and excitement to build upon our momentum as a pure-play branded company. Now turning to Commercial foods. As I said at the outset of my remarks, Lamb Weston delivered another great quarter, generating approximately 4% net sales growth. In our reported results, the strength of Lamb Weston's performance is masked by the fact that we include the impact of the divestures of Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and JM Swank, which were completed at the end of July.","Adjusted segment operating profit grew 33% in the quarter behind Lamb Weston's continued growth and favorable input costs. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive growth across the Lamb Weston business, leveraging its strong brand to capture emerging markets and international growth. Tom and the Lamb team look forward to sharing much more during their Investor Day on October 13 in New York. Before I conclude my remarks, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Amidst significant change, including a successful move to our new headquarters, our team remained focused on delivering our goals and serving our customers. In addition to driving strong performance, our team is also dedicated to being a good corporate citizen, and we were honored to be named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the sixth consecutive year, demonstrating recognition of our commitment to environmental and social goals in addition to economic objectives.","Now turning to one of our newest team members, I would like to welcome our new CFO, Dave Marberger, who joins us from Prestige Brands. Dave brings more than 30 years of finance and leadership experience to ConAgra Foods, including ten years as the CFO at Godiva Chocolatier and Tasty Baking Company. I first got to know Dave during his time with the Campbell Soup Company, and Dave is a proven and accomplished finance executive, and I am confident he will be a tremendous asset going forward. We are extremely happy to welcome him to the team.","With that, Dave, over to you.","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into my comments, I would like to say how energized I am to be part of this organization and leadership team. I look forward to getting to know many of you and the investor community in the weeks and months ahead. I will address several topics in my comments, including our new reporting segments; a recap of our 2017 fiscal first quarter performance; a summary of items impacting comparability, including some brief comments on goodwill impairment, cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet; and some brief comments on our upcoming Investor Day. As we outlined in the release, we now report our business results in five segments. They are Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen, International, Foodservice and Commercial. The Grocery & Snacks, Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments were previously included in our Consumer Foods segment and Foodservice was previously included in our Commercial Foods segment. Upon the completion of the Lamb Weston spin, the commercial segment will include only the historical results of JM Swank and Spicetec through the divestiture date, and the Lamb Weston results will be reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented.","Now I will provide some comments on our performance for our fiscal 2017 first quarter. Please note that references to adjusted earnings or operating profit referred to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Overall, net sales for the fiscal first quarter approximated $2.7 billion, down 5% from the year-ago quarter. The divestiture of JM Swank and Spicetec and the negative impact of foreign exchange accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the net sales decline versus the year-ago quarter. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fiscal first quarter of $0.42 compared with $0.38 in the prior year quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations for the first quarter was $0.61, 49% above the $0.41 delivered in the year-ago quarter and better than we planned. The strong first quarter EPS performance primarily reflects the benefits from continued gross margin expansion, lower SG&A expense and lower interest expense, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume, lower earnings from our Ardent Mills joint venture and some costs related to a product recall. As I will discuss later, the first quarter overdelivery versus our plan was driven, in part, by timing items for both SG&A and A&P expense.","In our Grocery & Snacks segment, net sales were $757 million for the quarter, down 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 6% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $185 million in the first quarter versus $142 million in the year-ago quarter. The strong increase in adjusted profit reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts, driven by pricing discipline and favorable product cost and productivity; reduced SG&A costs; and lower A&P spending due to timing, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume. In our Refrigerated & Frozen segment, net sales were $605 million for the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago period, reflecting an 11% decline in volume and a 3% improvement in price mix. Adjusted segment operating profit was $97 million in the first quarter versus $85 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in adjusted profit reflects the same continued progress on margin expansion efforts as outlined for the Grocery & Snacks segment, offset by approximately $9 million of costs related to a product recall.","In our International segment, net sales were $195 million for the quarter, down 6% from the year-ago period, reflecting a 2% decline in volume, a 1.5% improvement in price mix and a negative 5% impact from foreign exchange. We reported a segment operating loss of $149 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by a pretax impairment charge of $164 million related to our Canadian business. I'll say more about this shortly. Adjusted segment operating profit was $15 million in the first quarter versus $17 million in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in adjusted profit reflects lower sales in gross margins and a negative impact from FX, partially offset by modestly lower A&P and SG&A expenses. In our Foodservice segment, net sales were $268 million for the quarter, down 1% from the year-ago period. Adjusted segment operating profit was $24 million in the first quarter versus $26 million in the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower sales in gross margins, partially offset by lower A&P and SG&A expenses.","In the Commercial segment, net sales were $843 million or 2% below the prior year quarter, driven by the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures. Lamb Weston had a very solid quarter as net sales increased 4% versus the prior year quarter. The commercial segment's adjusted operating profit was $148 million versus $112 million in the year-ago quarter. This strong increase was driven primarily by the net sales growth and margin expansion in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the profit decline resulting from the JM Swank and Spicetec divestitures during the quarter. We realized proceeds of $486 million from these divestitures and recognized an aggregate book gain of approximately $198 million. We expect to utilize the capital loss tax asset to offset substantially all of the tax liabilities related to these divestitures.","In addition to the segment information, I will also note the following matters related to corporate or total company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $24 million for the current quarter and $37 million in the year-ago period. The decline principally reflects lower profits from our Ardent Mills joint venture. Adjusted corporate expenses were $38 million in the fiscal quarter versus $66 million in the year-ago quarter, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts, along with lower costs related to the timing of certain expenses that will come later in the fiscal year. Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $69 million, down 18% from the prior year quarter. Most of this decline was due to the timing of expense that will be incurred later in the fiscal year. Despite this lower spend, total gross rating points for our A&P investments were up 7% for the first quarter versus a year ago, reflecting improved efficiency. For the first quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $11 million and operating profit by $4 million versus the year-ago quarter.","Moving on to our SG&A cost savings initiatives, we are making very good progress and expect to realize the remainder of our $200 million of SG&A savings over the next two years as planned. While we saw significant benefits from SG&A savings in the first quarter, I would point out that some of this benefit was due to the timing of certain expenses moving to later in the fiscal year. We estimate that the benefit from timing for SG&A was $25 million to $30 million in the first quarter. I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter. We had $0.34 per diluted share of net expense related to impairment charges. Approximately $140 million pretax relates to impairment of goodwill and approximately $24 million pretax relates to impairment of intangible brand assets, both related to our Canadian business. The charges are principally the result of several factors. First, the change in our reporting segments now requires us to evaluate goodwill at a lower level. In the past, under the previous reporting segments, we were only required to evaluate goodwill at the total International business level. We are now required to evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit within the International segment.","Second, while the performance of our International business has been steady over the last several years on a constant currency basis, the significant weakening of the Canadian dollar has negatively impacted the value of the Canadian business on a U.S. dollar basis, which is used for the goodwill analysis. Finally, the brand impairment reflects both the unfavorable foreign exchange movements as well as some weaker top line trends in this portion of the business.","In addition to the impairment charges, we recognized $0.17 per diluted share of net gain from the sale of the JM Swank and Spicetec businesses. We also recognized $0.04 per diluted share of net expense related to restructuring costs and costs related to the planned spinoff of Lamb Weston. And finally, we recognized approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net benefit from favorable adjustments to state tax assets.","Moving on to cash flow, capital allocation and the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $795 million of cash on hand and no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Total net cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations for the first quarter were $337 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. This significant increase is due to the improved operating earnings in the current quarter and higher-than-normal income tax payments in the year-ago quarter. For the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $117 million versus $102 million in the prior year quarter. Net interest expense was $59 million in the fiscal first quarter versus $80 million in the year-ago quarter due to the paydown of debt during the past 12 months. For the quarter, we paid down approximately $554 million of long-term debt, and dividends for this fiscal quarter were $110 million versus $107 million in the prior year quarter.","During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $86 million, and we had approximately $46 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter. We continue to remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy appropriately balanced between further debt reduction, a top-tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. Lastly, our estimated effective tax rate for income from operations remains at 33.5% for the remainder of fiscal year 2017. The first quarter reported tax rate was higher primarily from the tax impacts of the noncash impairment charge and the gain on the sale of JM Swank and Spicetec. As we have noted in the release, we are not providing any comments on our outlook today. Instead, we will provide more information on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and the long-term algorithm for both ConAgra Brands and Lamb Weston at our upcoming Investor Days. We are excited about the opportunities to create value for both of these companies.","This concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Sean and I, along with Tom McGough and Tom Werner, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session.","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] It looks like our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar","Just two questions on gross margin, if I could. In the quarter, gross margins expanded about 200 basis points and recognizing pricing and trade spend discipline and some input costs favorability were some key drivers, I guess, was any of this due to maybe some supply chain initiatives that may have been taken but not maybe yet talked too publicly? Or is more of that on-the-come, so to speak? And I then I've just got a follow-up.","Sean Connolly","Well, we'll talk quite extensively, Andrew, about our plans with supply chain when we get to Investor Day. But on gross margin, obviously, there are a number of different things that are contributing to the gains we are seeing and the gain -- the size of the gains do vary quarter-to-quarter. But the important fact is that, over the past two years, we've made tremendous progress at gross margin and operating margin, and you saw that again this quarter. Quarter-to-quarter, the progress may vary due to a number of factors, but what I'm focused on is that we continue to move the centerline of our profitability north over time, while reducing the standard deviation around that centerline. On supply chain, look, first of all, clearly, the overall goal of our collective efforts is value and margin maximization. And supply chain productivity programs have always been, and will continue to be, an important component of that.","And as Dave Biegger will share at our upcoming ConAgra Brands Investor Day, strong productivity has been a legacy strength at ConAgra, and you saw some of that also this quarter. We do have a strong track record of continuous improvement in terms of network optimization, procurement, T&W, et cetera, and now that we're upgrading our volume base and reducing low-margin business, we are providing a better foundation to build off of, as we plan for future margin accretive innovation. And Dave has obviously brought a fresh perspective around how to sustain that strong historic supply chain performance and build on it even further, and he'll share those views in a few weeks.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. And that leads into my next one, which is based on some of the filings of Form 10s and such, it shows that ConAgra Brands will have a or does have a gross margin that is certainly substantially -- despite the progress, right, substantially lower than the large cap peer group. And I guess, I'm just curious, and I know you'll talk more about this in couple weeks, but is there any, I guess -- or how much of that gap, let's say, with the group do you see as maybe structural? Or any reason that this gap, I guess, can't be significantly narrowed over time? And is it something we'll hear more about perhaps at the Investor Day?","Sean Connolly","Yes, it certainly will be, and if you picked up on one of the comments I made, Andrew, in my prepared remarks, if you look at our branded businesses in the U.S. as an example, you've seen margin improvement of about 700 basis points versus the same quarter two years ago. So clearly, we believe and we demonstrated that we can do the things necessary to expand those margins and by no means do we think our work is done. We will continue to chip away at that, and we'll do it using a number of different factors. And we talked about those factors but, hopefully, investors are getting a sense of how relentless we are in terms of pursuing margin expansion.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask just a little reconciliation on the quarter itself. So the timing issue was, I think, you said $30 million, so that's something like $0.05, and then the lower tax rate was maybe worth another $0.04. So is it correct that maybe if you think about this quarter, let's say, a $0.54, it's still a very solid beat over your original guidance, but those two other effects are notable. Is that -- do I have those correct?","Dave Marberger","Yes. That's correct on the $30 million, David, with the SG&A and the tax rate is actually higher because of the impacts of the sale and the impairment.","David Driscoll","Sorry, versus the estimates that were going into the quarter is what I'm getting at for how we were modeling this. But okay, fine. And then as you look forward here, the -- is there any comments that you can give us on dyssynergies? Really, Sean, your comments are so very positive, but I always wonder if when breaking these things up, isn't there just fundamentally a dyssynergy number that's got to be overcome? And would just appreciate, I know this is maybe in advance of the big Analyst Day, but is there anything you can do to help us because we've got to put numbers out today for the forward forecast and would appreciate any comments on the dyssynergy computations.","Sean Connolly","David, the strategy that we've been undertaking to transform this portfolio, we've been at it now for a while, and we have anticipated that you will have some things that flow back against you. It's one of the reasons why we moved so aggressively on the $300 million efficiency program right out of the gate is because we wanted to stay out ahead of this stuff. Similarly, it's the same reason our supply chain team is aggressively trying to get out ahead of any absorption benefits that we might lose when we pull back on volume. So we try to look around corners. We try to anticipate it and then we try to stay ahead of it. So with respect to ConAgra Brands, sure, there will be some modest stranded as we go ahead and step through these things, but that's part of the reason why you see us getting so aggressive on costs. Lamb is a standalone company, and you'll see the details on that in the Form-10. And obviously when you set up a standalone company, you're going to incur some unique costs for doing that but obviously, we strongly believe the benefit of having Lamb as an independent pure-play company with its great performance and growth prospects is really the story there. That's a terrific equity, and we can't wait to tell investors about the story in a few weeks.","Operator","We'll take a question now from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rob Moskow","Sean, I was -- in your prepared remarks, you said a lot about trying to get away from the highly priced sensitive consumer by walking away from a lot of these promotional programs, and I think that makes a lot of sense. I think one of the challenges you might have at the Analyst Day is, the perception of the portfolio of ConAgra is that a lot of the brands are targeted towards price-sensitive consumers that they are value brands. In your work on those brands, have you found kind of like a segmentation within those consumers that X percent are really price-sensitive for Chef, for example, but Y percent are very loyal. And do you have any insight for us on that that could help us?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I'll make a brief comment, Rob, and then I'll turn it over to Tom McGough to add some color. But when we're talking about these incredibly, what I'll call, price-obsessed consumers who really only buy on prices, it's not a large percentage of the user base. I mean, there is plenty -- way more brand loyal users in the user base in brands like Banquet. The issue is catering to that small group that is super price-sensitive has an unwanted effect on the balance of the business. So we've got terrific brands. And keep in mind, you've got millions and millions and millions of households out there that make $50,000 a year that need good value and -- but they are incredibly brand loyal households as well. Tom, you want to add anything to that?","Tom McGough","Sure. What I'd add is, we will provide data that splits our volume base across loyals and switchers, and the vast majority of our consumer base are those consumers that are loyal that buy their purchases based on the strength, the benefit, the features of our products. I think what Sean highlighted is that, by focusing on incremental volume to trade promotion, we're subsidizing the purchases of those people that would normally buy us at full retail price. And our focus on trade is trying to improve the ROI on those merchandising events. So at the end of the day, we will have a stronger consumer base with a higher percentage of loyal consumers, and we will drive margin improvement through the trade productivity that we will invest in those attributes that those consumers are looking for over time.","Operator","Ken Goldman with JPMorgan has our next question.","Ken Goldman","In looking at the SG&A reduction, I know you talked about how some of it was temporary. I'm trying to get a sense though of how much of the remainder of that, right, is still the majority of that reduction that's not being deferred to later in the year, we can think of as maybe permanent. So maybe could you help us break out some of the drivers of that reduction, may be roughly bucket headcount reductions versus A&P savings, things like that? And I guess, as a carload to that, in terms of the amount that was pushed out of 1Q, I think you said $25 million to $30 million, could we model all of that being in 2Q? Or should we spread that throughout the year, as we look ahead?","Sean Connolly","First of all, Ken, I'll start, and Dave, if you want to add any color, go right ahead. The SG&A program that we've been focused on is a $200 million program, that is not an A&P program. That is a structural SG&A program. And we are, obviously, making great progress against our $200 million goal. Yes, we are tracking a bit of schedule but also some of what you are seeing, as Dave mentioned, is timing. And we're going to get into our outlook in terms of how it will flow going forward in a few weeks when we get to our Investor Day for ConAgra Brands. But the way I'd think about SG&A or for that matter, any inefficiency opportunities, we got our targets, we're making good progress on our targets, and we'll always continue to look for more pockets of inefficiency because it just gives us more fuel for growth.","Dave Marberger","And Ken, let me call on that.","Ken Goldman","Okay.","Dave Marberger","Just so if you look at SG&A and you have to work through all the adjusted items, right, so if you look at the total SG&A, if you look year-on-year, we're down about $75 million for the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, about $30 million of that is really a timing that will come in, in later quarter. So that's where -- $40 million to $45 million is really the incremental kind of run rate, if you will, for the quarter for that. As you know, we started the savings in fiscal '16 really in the Q3 and 4, so Q2 will be another big incremental quarter, and then it'll start to wrap in the second half of this year where the increases will be less. But by the end of this fiscal year, we'll be 85% to 90% complete in terms of the total $200 million reduction plan.","Ken Goldman","Okay, that's helpful, Dave. Quick follow-up, if I can. On Lamb Weston, you decided to load it up with a decent amount of leverage. Is that the natural result of wanting ConAgra Brands to have a squeaky clean balance sheet, maybe for M&A? And I'm a little confused about the decision to spin it off without a permanent CFO in place, it's a little unusual. That's not about anyone in particular, I like John, I'm just not sure how much confidence investors are going to have in whatever path is, I guess, outlined at the Analyst Day given that there is a new CFO coming in a few months later. So maybe you could help us understand the decision-making there?","Sean Connolly","Yes. Let me try to be helpful there, Ken. With respect, first of all, to the Lamb leverage, the ConAgra Board has been squarely focused on how to maximize total value, and this is top of mind when thinking about decisions like leverage. And as you'll see at Lamb's Investor Day in a couple of weeks, it is an extremely strong business with excellent cash flows, and we are quite confident that it will continue to thrive. Beyond that, we're going to hold off until the Investor Day to get into details on things like capital priorities. With respect to the Lamb CFO, I think the big picture here that I don't want investors to lose is, we are making excellent progress rounding out the Lamb management team.","You're going to learn more about these folks here in short order as well as populating the Board with seasoned veterans that are really going to help this company get off, I believe, to a flying start. We are very far along in terms of the CFO search process. I don't want to get into the details of that process or our motives publicly for obvious reasons, but with the Investor Day just a couple of weeks away, we are very fortunate to have John Gehring help us get things launched. And for those of you who weren't tracking with Ken's comments, you might have missed the -- in this morning's announcement that John will be the Interim CFO here over the course of the next couple of months, as we stand Lamb up. But again, we'll have more to talk about on our permanent CFO in the not-so-distant future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.","Bryan Spillane","Just two quick ones for me. First, and I might have missed this, but the effective tax rate in the quarter once you've excluded all of the one-time items, just -- what's the clean sort of effective tax rate?","Dave Marberger","The clean effective tax rate, 33.5%.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then the second one for you, Sean, is just -- as you're going through this process of reducing the -- your promotional activity and taking that the volume hit that comes with that, velocity starts to slow. And sometimes when velocity slows, it starts to compound on itself. So can you talk a little bit about just what you are doing? What the circuit breakers are just to make sure you don't get yourself into a situation where you've got the sort of the volume base right but it's hard to restart some velocity because of where the momentum is? And I guess, related to that, just could you confirm, it sounds like with advertising and marketing may be down in the quarter, you're still going through this process of resetting volume at a time where there's going to -- you're not really maybe necessarily fully supporting the brands with the advertising you tend to?","Sean Connolly","All right. There's a lot there. Let me try to hit the key points there. First of all, what we're doing it's a bit like if any of you have ever remodeled a house, it's a bit like that. The process is a bit messy, but if you want to get to the desired outcome, you got to go through the process. And this is a transformation that we're undertaking here, and our approach is to value profitable growth, not any growth but we do keep a close eye on markers to make sure that the business is in control and doing what we plan. So as an example, if you get into the scanner data and you peel it back, you'll see obvious things that you should expect such as baseline trends being significantly different from promoted trends. And then furthermore, if you get into baseline velocities, you will see that our baseline velocities are, in fact, quite stable. You will see TPDs going back, but you'll see TPDs going back because we, along with being very focused on price, have infused into the marketplace over a number of years a long tail of low-margin, nonproductive SKUs of multiple sizes that we are -- frankly, they had no value, so we've to get them out. Our customers appreciate that. It's part of being good category managers.","And then the key is to continue to support the items that are moving at strong velocities, contemporizing them, refreshing them and then adding to them with new innovation and then ultimately proper marketing support. Now with respect to your question of marketing support in the quarter, yes, A&P was down. Some of that is timing because we do want to align our A&P spend with planned in-market actions like innovation launches and key promotions, things like that. So some of its timing, but some of it is just good discipline and getting rid of nonworking or attempted working marketing that just, frankly, wasn't. And that is you see -- and also buying better. Your GRPs were up 7% in the quarter on a fewer dollars, so the impact was reasonably respectable. And I think it's important that we keep that kind of support out there while we're taking some of these promotion items, so we can really evolve the conversation with our consumer to be about something other than price and that's we're doing. We'll talk about this quite extensively along with things like portfolio segmentation strategy in a few weeks at our Investor Day.","Operator","We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Two questions. Firstly, on the volume declines. You talked a lot about how a lot of that's deliberate given the actions that you're taken to improve the quality of revenues. Are you able to tell us if you haven't taken those actions, what the underlying volume decline would have been? And further, are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of overall volumes are associated with these consumer segments that you're really not that interested in? So volume is the first one. The second question is we're hearing from a number of places that retailers, particularly large retailers, are beginning to demand more reinvestment in price and promotional activity, which seems to be the opposite direction from where you're going. How do think that's going to play out in 2017? And are you confident that you can sort of hold your ground without losing distribution?","Sean Connolly","Sure. Alexia, I'll take the second one first. On the notion that some retailers may be asking for more promotion, quite frankly, that tends to vary fairly meaningfully by category depending upon what a retailer's objectives are with particular categories. In general, our customers are asking us for growth and innovation. They want to see us evolve our brand so that we're not competing on price, so that we're competing on quality measures. You see customers giving more and more real state to these challenger brands that have modern food attributes like natural, organic, premium. These are the things that consumers are demanding, and this is what many of our retailers in our categories are prioritizing. And it's precisely why we're evolving the businesses that we own as well as adding new businesses that are complementarity like Frontera, Blake's and others like that. With respect to our volume piece, let's go back to the point in my prepared remarks, I think, that really describes it best.","This is a -- our actions are broad-based but the volume decline, when you add it up, is incredibly concentrated. And in our case, it was in our six brands, each of which has its own story as to what we're doing and why we're doing it. But if you use Banquet as an example because that's the biggie, here's how to think about Banquet. The bottom line is locking a brand into a $1 price point for decade. It's just not a good business decision because it puts relentless pressure on margins and in turn, food quality. And at the same time, it retrains our Banquet loyalists to buy on deal. So the change was long overdue. And while the topline optics can be ugly until you wrap a year later, it's up over 300 basis points, the business and grows margin, which is excellent news. Now we've got to continue to support the business with levers other than price. And that's what we're going to do, and that's what our customers are counting on us to do.","Operator","We'll take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Lubi Kutua","This is Lubi filling in for Akshay. First question is just on the consumer brands businesses. If you can comment on advertising expense this quarter, just trying to understand the different pieces of the -- setting the profit outperformance this quarter. So how much was -- advertising expenses were down during the quarter? And how should we think about that going forward?","Sean Connolly","A&P was down in the quarter, as we talked. GRPs were up so impact was up, but we spent less money. We will move -- some of those dollars are moved into the remaining quarters for the balance of the year, as we talked. But it'll -- a piece of it was timing and a piece of it was just improved efficiency.","Operator","We'll move now to Mario Contreras with Deutsche Bank.","Mario Contreras","Sean, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there were some good outperformance from the supply chain team in offsetting some of the over head absorption from the volume declines. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about how they're able to go about achieving that? And then related to that, how were the volume declines tracking versus your expectations going into the quarter?","Sean Connolly","Yes. The supply chain team at ConAgra has been doing a great job for a long time. I don't know how much we've talked about the capabilities that we've had with investors, but we intend to do that in a few weeks. And we've had very strong gross productivity performance historically, and we're continuing to work to not only sustain that but to find new ways to build upon that, and we'll outline that here coming up in a few weeks for you. With respect to the volume overall, it's pretty consistent with what we expect. And if you just go back to our last couple of quarters, I've tried to be very transparent around not only our strategy, but the implications of our strategy and the notion that it's not always pretty to look at but it's important that we go through this if we're going to get to a different place. And -- but we feel like we're squarely on track.","Operator","We'll take a question now from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Sean, a lot of what you've done had obviously made tremendous improvements to the value proposition. And I'm wondering, how much of -- you talked about these, your price seeking, your value only consumers, how much of this is a change in the consumers, say, over the past three or four years where maybe the strategies that were good four years ago are less relevant today? And how much of this is just you bringing a fresh set of eyes and a new methodology to the business? And I asked because maybe that -- those trends continue and it's actually maybe it's a little bit of -- it's a great time for -- I shouldn't say it's a great time, it's a much improved time for lower and middle income consumers right now with falling gas prices and wage gains. And I wonder if maybe just that improvement is helping you realize this pricing and maybe better-than-expected results?","Sean Connolly","The way I'd think about it, John, is when the consumer looks at a brand, the brand is going to communicate something to them. For a long time, our brands communicated deal. We are a deal brand and interestingly, even low income consumers are very interested in a brand communicating with them on other means. For example, there were -- there was a period of time in our past where our PAM business was heavily promoted and the only trick in the book that we turned to was dealing. But if you look at consumer trends in oil over the last few years, you see that the oils have changed, it's moved to things like olive oil, things like coconut oil. So instead of competing on PAM on price attributes, we've evolved the PAM business, and we've got olive oil PAM. We've got coconut oil PAM. These are relevant modern-day attributes that changed the discussion with the consumer to be about something that they value and they will pay more for and not about deep discounting. That's just one example. We'll talk about more examples at our Investor Day, but that's exactly what we need to do to get really the loyalty up on our business, get our prices up and build our overall brand strength to make it as modern as it can be.","Operator","Our final question today will come from Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Michael Walsh","It's actually Michael Walsh filling in for Todd. Sean and Dave, you've been consistent in publicly stating your desire to retain an investment grade credit rating. And earlier, you mentioned that as well. You also mentioned debt reduction, and I know ConAgra Brands will get a $675 million payment from Lamb Weston with the spin. You're going to lose a chunk of EBITDA. Can you just talk about how much debt reduction you expect going forward? And do you have any type of leverage target that you would manage your balance sheet to?","Sean Connolly","Yes, thanks for the question. With respect to balance sheet questions, we're going to get into that in earnest in a few weeks at Investor Day. But with respect to ConAgra Brands, big picture as we've said and as you pointed out, as we intend to continue our commitment to being rated investment grade, we'll continue to a balanced capital allocation philosophy with strong dividend and a willingness to buy back shares and an appreciation for smart, value creating M&A. All of those things are fair game, which is not a departure from where we've been but rather very consistent. But we'll get into more details here on that in a few weeks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Johan Nystedt","Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. As always, we're available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.","Operator","This concludes today's ConAgra Foods First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Brian Kearney","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for adjusting your schedules and joining us today. This morning, we will be discussing both our agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods and our fourth quarter results. I remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements about ConAgra Brands, the proposed acquisition of Pinnacle Foods and the expected benefits of the proposed acquisition. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. Descriptions of risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.","Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. References to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Please see the earnings press release for additional information on our comparability items. The reconciliations of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in either the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.","Now, I will turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone and thank you again for accommodating the date change and joining our conference call today to discuss our agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods and our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and full year earnings. We have got a lot to cover obviously. So, let\u2019s go ahead and get started.","Over the past 3 years, we have made significant progress against our plan to transform ConAgra into a pure-play branded food company and establish a solid platform for future growth. We have built industry leading innovation capabilities, completely overhauled our culture and unlocked significant shareholder value. The impact of these efforts is evident in the tremendous Q4 that we announced today, having delivered 2% organic net sales growth and approximately 16% adjusted operating profit growth. Clearly, our hard work is paying off with improved and more consistent performance. All of these actions have positioned us to take the next step in our evolution.","Today\u2019s announcement of our agreement to acquire Pinnacle Foods builds on the strong foundation we have established and serves as a catalyst to accelerate value creation for shareholders. It will enhance our scale by combining two growing portfolios of iconic brands and create a leader in frozen foods, while also expanding our presence in snacks. We are bringing together two highly complementary companies, with a strong combined balance sheet, positioning us to capture compelling financial benefits, including attractive synergies. Importantly, with a strong leadership team and proven capabilities driving brand building and innovation, we are confident in our ability to successfully integrate this acquisition and to build continued momentum and deliver meaningful shareholder value.","Now, before I get into more detail about why we are so excited about this acquisition, I do want to take a step back for a moment and talk about where we are in terms of executing our plan and how we positioned ConAgra to make this transaction a success. 3 years ago this month, I hosted my first call as CEO of ConAgra. And during that call, I outlined my view that there was tremendous opportunity at the company, but that in order to unlock it, we needed to move quickly and take bold actions on a number of fronts and we did just that. We exited private brands as well as non-core businesses like Spicetec and JM Swank and we successfully executed the Lamb Weston spin. With these changes and many others, we transformed ConAgra into a new pure-play branded food company. At our inaugural Investor Day in 2016, we described the cadence of our work for our new company in a 5-year plan. Initially, our focus was to reset the top line by breaking ConAgra of its volume at any cost approach and to focus on our cost structure. Recognizing that cost-cutting wasn\u2019t enough, we outlined a plan to bend the top line trend by building an innovation pipeline supported by new marketing programs and adding on-trend brands through modernizing acquisitions like Blake\u2019s, Frontera, Thanasi Foods, Angie\u2019s BOOMCHICKAPOP and Sandwich Bros. with a focus on driving profitable growth.","Looking ahead to fiscal \u201819 and \u201820, we are focused on accelerating our growth and maintaining the strong momentum that has continued to build over the last 3 years. Meanwhile, margin expansion has become and will remain a way of life at ConAgra over the long-term. As we close fiscal 2018, we are delivering on the commitments we outlined at our Investor Day in 2016. We have made significant progress toward our goals of increasing margins, improving our top line and building a winning company.","Now, moving to Slide 9, you can see that by aggressively attacking costs to right-size our SG&A and driving realized productivity, we have been able to achieve strong margin improvement. Adjusted gross margin increased by 380 basis points since fiscal 2015 and adjusted operating margin increased by 460 basis points over the same 3-year period. But we knew we had to grow. So, we strengthened our foundation by pruning low-value SKUs, updating our innovation capabilities to modernize our iconic brands and investing behind on-trend brands consumers are demanding. We are also keenly focused on our differentiated capabilities in our value-over-volume strategy. Collectively, these efforts have enabled us to successfully bend the trend on the top line and we continue to gain traction. This was our primary focus during fiscal 2018 and we are pleased with our momentum as underlying sales trends continue to strengthen and the quality of our revenue base continues to improve as reflected in increasing and higher quality total points of distribution.","Base velocities also remain strong and base dollar sales continue to grow. It\u2019s been hard work, but we have built a much healthier business and one that is less promotional with a greater percentage of volume coming from loyal households at a higher margin. By investing in renovation and innovation, we have improved the quality of our portfolio and positioned the business for sustainable growth. Our aggressive efforts to modernize iconic brands and add new on-trend brands have been critical to driving results. Slide 12 shows a snapshot of our successful innovation efforts in fiscal 2018 with several more on the way in fiscal 2019 and we are just getting started.","And finally in order to build a truly winning company overall, we had to look inward at our culture and the way we operate. This resulted in a complete overhaul that has touched every area of the business. We right-sized the organizations and now have fewer layers and broader spans of control, resulting in a lean company with a focus on self-service. And across the board, we have made an effort to encourage a collaborative work environment, making ConAgra a better place to work and fostering a results oriented culture of innovation and productivity. All of this has translated into very strong returns for our shareholders. Since the Board prepared to move in a new direction in August of 2014, total shareholder return is nearly 104%, almost doubling the return of the S&P 500.","So, that\u2019s the backdrop to today\u2019s exciting announcement. The bottom line here is that in the past 3 years, we have done heavy lifting in order to build a strong platform for future growth while also generating tremendous shareholder value. Importantly, it has positioned us to acquire Pinnacle Foods and accelerate our ability to generate value. By acquiring Pinnacle, we are combining two portfolios with industry-leading growth to create an $11 billion company with iconic brands in frozen, snacking, refrigerated and grocery categories. The new company will be a leader in frozen foods and will have enhanced scale overall to better partner with customers.","In addition to our complementary portfolios, ConAgra and Pinnacle have similar results oriented cultures. We believe Pinnacle will be an excellent cultural and operational fit. When coupled with our proven track record of executing strategic transactions, we will be able to implement a smooth integration process. In addition to the strategic and cultural benefits, we expect attractive financial returns with an IRR above our WACC and EPS accretion in the first full fiscal year following close.","Dave will take you through the details, but let me point out a few highlights of the transaction. Pinnacle\u2019s shareholders will receive an implied value of $68 per share in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion. This transaction price represents a 15.8x adjusted EBITDA multiple before synergies based on Pinnacle\u2019s estimated fiscal year 2018 results and 12.1x adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies. We expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in fiscal \u201820 with that accretion increasing as strong cost synergies phase in. As we have said many times before, we remain committed to a solid investment grade credit rating with a focus on de-leveraging over the next few years. We expect the transaction to close by the end of calendar 2018, subject to Pinnacle\u2019s shareholder approval, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.","Now, for those of you who may not be familiar with Pinnacle, the company\u2019s full year 2017 net sales were $3.1 billion, the majority of which came from its frozen and grocery segments. Pinnacle\u2019s portfolio of frozen, refrigerated and shelf-stable products includes iconic brands such as Birds Eye, Duncan Hines, Earth Balance and Udi\u2019s, just to name a few. Like ConAgra, Pinnacle has been a leader in innovation and has delivered solid top line results over time. Following the completion of the transaction, the new ConAgra Brands portfolio will be comprised of iconic brands with leading positions in strong categories. This will include $2 billion brands, Birds Eye and Marie Callender\u2019s.","As you see on Slide 19, this transaction will bring together two of the fastest growing portfolios in the industry based on domestic retail scanner data. For our most recent fiscal quarter, ConAgra Brands had the second highest year-over-year growth rate in the industry and Pinnacle was fourth. We believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to continue strong consumption trends with the expanded brand portfolio and broader in-store reach of the combined company.","Slide 20 demonstrates how the acquisition will improve our overall scale as well as our position in frozen foods. In the scanner data, combined fiscal 2018 total retail sales were over $12 billion, making the company a top 5 industry player. Together, the combined company will be the #2 player in frozen foods with $4.9 billion in sales. As you know, I have been saying for years that there is significant opportunity in frozen. It\u2019s a large space with long-term tailwinds. This transaction positions us to continue to build on our success and deliver even more great products for consumers.","On Slide 21, you can see the complementary nature of our portfolios within our existing domains. Together, we will have a diverse, inherently hedged portfolio of leading iconic brands. We expect that the combined company will create new opportunities to partner with our customers. While I already touched on frozen, this transaction also enhances our portfolio of brands across other attractive domains, including snacks and sweet treats. As we have discussed before, this domain is an extremely compelling and exciting opportunity. You have already heard me speak about our efforts around culture at ConAgra, so I quickly want to highlight that we believe the cultures at ConAgra and Pinnacle are highly complementary and that our organizations are a natural fit. Much like ConAgra, Pinnacle shares our focus on innovation and on maintaining a lean and efficient operating structure and close ties with customers. This like-minded approach will be critical as we combine the two companies.","So in summary, the strategic rationale is clear. We are acquiring a portfolio of complementary, leading brands that strengthens our scale, enhances our position in the attractive frozen space and provides more opportunities for innovation. From a financial fit standpoint, the acquisition meets all of our criteria. We look forward to continuing the top line momentum at both companies and delivering meaningful cost synergies and IRR that exceeds our WACC and earnings accretion. At the same time, we will remain committed to a healthy capital structure, including a solid investment grade rating. With our greater scale across leading iconic brands and an unwavering focus on driving innovation and profitable growth and a strong balance sheet and cash flow, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to drive long-term shareholder value.","With that, I will hand the call over to Dave to share more financial details on the transaction and on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 results. Dave?","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean and good morning everyone. Let me begin by reiterating how excited we are about this transaction. I will start by sharing some additional details pertaining to the deal and we will then briefly discuss our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial performance before we open it up for Q&A.","Building on Sean\u2019s comments, we are acquiring Pinnacle Foods in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $10.9 billion, including Pinnacle\u2019s outstanding net debt of $2.7 billion. Under the terms of the agreement, Pinnacle\u2019s shareholders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 shares of ConAgra stock for each share they hold, equating to an implied price of $68 per Pinnacle share. Pinnacle\u2019s shareholders are expected to own approximately 16% of the combined company, assuming our issuance of incremental equity to the public to assist in funding the deal. This transaction price represents an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 15.8x pre-synergies based on Pinnacle Foods\u2019 estimated fiscal year 2018 results and 12.1x adjusted EBITDA, including run-rate cost synergies. We secured a committed $9 billion bridge facility until permanent financing is raised.","We expect to finance the $10.9 billion transaction by issuing $3 billion of ConAgra Brands\u2019 stock to Pinnacle\u2019s shareholders and raising $7.9 billion of cash. The cash is expected to be raised through the issuance of $7.3 billion of transaction debt and the generation of $600 million of incremental cash proceeds from either a public equity offering and\/or divestitures. We have assumed that we would issue the full $600 million in equity in calculating the deal metrics, but the ultimate mix of equity issuance and divestitures will depend on timing considerations, credit implications and market conditions.","ConAgra Brands\u2019 pro forma net debt to EBITDA ratio is expected to be approximately 5x at closing. ConAgra is committed to a solid investment grade rating and has a targeted leverage ratio of 3.5x as we prioritize de-leveraging. We also expect to refinance all of Pinnacle\u2019s debt in connection with the closing. Assuming an end of calendar year 2018 closing, we expect the transaction to be low single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis in fiscal year 2020, the first full fiscal year following close and to be high single-digit accretive to adjusted EPS on a percentage basis by fiscal year \u201822.","We are expecting $215 million in run-rate cost synergies by the end of fiscal year \u201822, which represents approximately 7% of Pinnacle\u2019s net sales. We estimate a cash cost to achieve those synergies of $355 million, split approximately 60% operating expense and 40% CapEx. The synergies are expected to be driven by savings across procurement, logistics, manufacturing and SG&A. We expect to recognize approximately 60% of the synergies by the end of fiscal year \u201820, with the remainder phased in through fiscal \u201822. Our current estimate of incremental and tangible amortization from the deal is $55 million.","As I previously mentioned, we are committed to a solid investment grade credit rating and our target leverage ratio is 3.5x. We expect to maintain our annual dividend of $0.85 per share during fiscal \u201819 and in the future, we are targeting modest dividend increases as we prioritize de-leveraging. In late Q4 of fiscal \u201818, we suspended our share repurchase program. Going forward, we will only repurchase shares if we are tracking ahead of our leverage targets. Also, we have approximately $720 million remaining on our capital loss carry-forward, which does not expire until the end of fiscal year \u201821. As a result, we can divest assets in a tax-efficient manner to support financing as appropriate.","Now, I realize that you will have questions regarding the transaction announcement, but before we take your questions, let me quickly summarize our strong earnings results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018. As Sean mentioned earlier, we continued to execute against our transformation plan in fiscal 2018 and delivered strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. Net sales for the fourth quarter were up 5.6% compared to a year ago. Organic net sales grew 2% driven by solid growth in both of our domestic retail segments. For the full year, net sales were up 1.4% and organic net sales decreased 0.2% in line with our estimates. For the fourth quarter, adjusted gross profit increased 6.1% to $573 million and adjusted gross margin improved 12 basis points to 29.2%. For the full year, adjusted gross profit decreased 0.5% and adjusted gross margin was 29.7%.","In the quarter, A&P expense decreased to $59 million or 3% of net sales. For the full year, A&P expense decreased to $279 million or 3.5% of net sales. Our decline in A&P expense was offset by increased retailer marketing investment to drive brand saliency, enhanced distribution and consumer trial in store. Adjusted SG&A for the quarter was up 3.4% and was 11.1% of net sales. For the full year, adjusted SG&A of $798 million was down slightly and was 10.1% of net sales.","Adjusted operating profit was up 16.4% for the fourth quarter and adjusted operating profit for the full year was up 3.5%. Importantly, adjusted operating margin continued its improvement versus the prior year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 139 basis points from a year ago. Full year adjusted operating margin was 16.1%, up 33 basis points versus the prior year and in line with our full year guidance. Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50 for the fourth quarter, up 35.1% from the prior year. And for the full year, adjusted diluted EPS was $2.11, up 21.3%, above the high end of our guidance.","Slide 30 outlines the drivers of our fourth quarter and full year net sales change versus a year ago. During the fourth quarter, organic net sales growth of 2% was consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. For the full fiscal year, net sales grew 1.4% and organic net sales declined 0.2%, which was near the high-end of our full year guidance range.","Slide 31 outlines the puts and takes on our full year adjusted gross margin decline. As we have been saying through the year, inflation has been coming in higher than we originally expected, finishing the year at 3.8%. Our integrated margin management team identified the margin levers to help offset that inflation and delivered strong results during the year. As you can see in this chart, if we remove the impact of the shift in marketing investments from A&P to retailer marketing, our adjusted gross margin would have been flat in fiscal year \u201818.","Instead of going through the details of each segment this quarter, I will just call out a few big takeaways. First, in the fourth quarter, all four of our operating segments grew operating profit and expanded operating margin. Second, both domestic retail segments grew organic net sales in the quarter. Next, our international segment expanded operating margin in each fiscal quarter this year. And finally, the Foodservice segment\u2019s net sales growth rate has started to improve. The segment has now begun to lap its value-over-volume actions.","Slide 33 summarizes our full year segment results and how the improvements in adjusted operating profit and margin flow by segment. I will not discuss this in detail, but I do want to reinforce that the strong fourth quarter performance across all segments gives us strong momentum heading into fiscal year \u201819.","Slide 34 outlines the drivers of our 35% adjusted EPS improvement versus the fourth quarter a year ago. An increase in adjusted gross profit drove $0.06 of the EPS increase. Lower SG&A and A&P expense added $0.02 of improvement, which was offset by unfavorable interest expense and a slight decrease in the Ardent Mills joint venture income of $0.01. Tax reform and share repurchases added $0.03 of EPS improvement.","Slide 35 outlines the drivers of our full year adjusted EPS improvement of plus 21% versus a year ago. The slight decrease of $0.02 in adjusted gross profit for the year was more than offset by lower SG&A and A&P expense, which drove $0.10 of the EPS improvement. Another $0.10 of improvement came from increased Ardent Mills joint venture income and favorable interest expense. We saw a $0.06 favorable impact from tax and a $0.13 contribution from share repurchase activity.","Slide 36 summarizes select balance sheet and cash flow information for the fiscal year. Net cash flow from operating activities for continuing operations was $920 million for the year, down from $1.1 billion last year primarily driven by the $300 million pension plan contribution we made in the fourth quarter. We had capital expenditures of $252 million, up slightly versus the prior year. During 2018, we paid dividends of $342 million and repurchased approximately $967 million worth of stock. We ended the year with $3.8 billion in total debt and approximately $128 million of cash on hand.","In the first quarter of 2019, we are adopting a new accounting standard, which requires us to change how our income statement looks. We are now adding a new line item named pension and postretirement non-service income. The impact of this change is that we will reclassify $86 million of pension income out of adjusted operating profit and into this new line item below adjusted operating profit, reducing adjusted operating margin by 110 basis points. It is important to note that there is no impact to net income, only a shift between the line items. Today, we furnished an 8-K with historical financial information, so that people can better understand the changes on a historical basis and put our fiscal \u201819 guidance into the appropriate context.","As we noted last quarter, now that our pension plan is more fully funded, we can reduce future volatility by changing the pension asset mix to a higher percentage of fixed income securities and a lower percentage of equity and other securities. The net impact of this change is a non-cash P&L headwind in fiscal year \u201819 as the new line item pension and postretirement non-service income will move from $86 million in fiscal \u201818 to approximately $40 million in fiscal \u201819. Note that this $46 million income reduction represents approximately $0.09 of negative EPS impact in fiscal \u201819.","On Slide 39, we summarized our standalone fiscal 2019 outlook, which does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Pinnacle. We expect net sales growth to be in the range of 0.5% to 1.5%. As we mentioned in this morning\u2019s release, we recently sold our Trenton, Missouri production facility. As part of the transaction, the Foodservice segment exited a non-core co-manufacturing agreement that generated $79 million in net sales in fiscal 2018. Excluding the impact of the Trenton facility sale, we expect organic net sales growth to be in the range of 1% to 2%. We expect adjusted operating margin, which reflects the impact of the pension reclassification I just discussed in the range of 15% to 15.3% as we continue to strengthen our portfolio and invest in product innovation.","We expect pension and postretirement non-service income of approximately $40 million for fiscal \u201819. We expect an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%, consistent with what we guided to at CAGNY. We are not providing full year EPS guidance given the dynamics of the pending acquisition of Pinnacle, including the yet-to-be-determined impact of our permanent financing to interest expense and shares outstanding. Due to the timing of the Pinnacle announcement, we are however providing guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","For the quarter, we expect reported net sales growth in the range of 2% to 2.5%, adjusted operating margin in the range of 14.1% to 14.4%, which again is on the new basis to reflect the pension accounting reclassification, and adjusted EPS in the range of $0.46 to $0.49. We remain on track to deliver on our 3-year standalone fiscal 2020 financial algorithm, which uses fiscal 2017 as the base year.","As outlined on Slide 41, today, we are truing up our algorithm to reflect changes in pension accounting standards and our strategic decision to shift marketing investments from A&P to above the net sales line retailer marketing. We continue to expect an organic net sales compound annual growth rate to be in the range of 1% to 2%. While the strategic decision to shift from A&P marketing to retailer marketing provides a headwind to net sales growth, we expect an offsetting improvement in sales from those investments. Due to this marketing shift, adjusted gross margin is now expected to be approximately 30.5%. As a result of the new pension accounting reclassification, adjusted SG&A excluding A&P is now expected to be approximately 11.8%. Meanwhile, we expect A&P as a percentage of net sales to be approximately 3.2%, which is consistent with our deliberate choice to shift marketing investments from A&P to retailers. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting the pension re-class.","In summary, we continue to make excellent progress executing our strategic plan as evidenced by our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results. Although we will not update our long-term algorithm until after we close on the Pinnacle acquisition, you can expect to see a combined company that leverages the strengths of two winning organizations. We expect top line growth to continue at the pace both companies have delivered, but by combining two very strong portfolios, the sustainability of that growth is enhanced. And with the addition of Pinnacle, we expect an improved margin profile and EPS accretion versus the ConAgra base business. As Sean mentioned, ConAgra has made tremendous progress over the last 3 years and we view the pending acquisition of Pinnacle as a catalyst to additional value creation for shareholders.","That concludes my remarks. I will now pass it to the operator, as Sean, Tom McGough and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Good morning. Thank you. Hoping to get some color on why the synergies aren\u2019t a little bit higher than the typical 7%ish rate in food. Just wondering are the supply chain synergies in frozen not as high as maybe we expected? Is it that Pinnacle\u2019s SG&A is already very low and efficient or maybe is there \u2013 I am hoping maybe some \u2013 there is just some conservatism in there, so any help you guys can provide there would be greatly appreciated?","Sean Connolly","Ken, let me start and then Dave add whatever color you want to add versus some of the things I have read, Ken, I think probably the biggest modeling difference is within COGS in manufacturing. So we have got 7% synergies here, which we are highly confident in. We have scrubbed every opportunity and we are \u2013 we feel very good we can deliver this number. But I think sometimes there is a belief that when you put two companies together, you can take half of the manufacturing assets, half of the plants and consolidate them, that\u2019s not how it actually works in practice. The example I would give you is a vegetable processing plant is not the same as a frozen food manufacturing plant. You have to process vegetables in very close proximity to the field, because of the delicacy of the vegetables, which is different than how we make say frozen meals. So I think some of \u2013 perhaps the assumptions around manufacturing assets were more aggressive than what exist in reality. The numbers we have got in here we feel very good about and obviously, it\u2019s kind of like how we approach margins in general. We always look to over deliver, but this is the number that we believe is correct and it\u2019s about on par with what we have seen elsewhere in the industry. Dave, what I missed?","Dave Marberger","No, I think you covered it. I think it\u2019s also important to understand that the $215 million, that\u2019s a real synergy number. So there is no \u2013 that\u2019s going to hit the P&L and that\u2019s going to be favorability that you will model. We feel \u2013 as Sean said, we feel very good about that, the ability to deliver that. As I mentioned in my comments, we believe 60% of that will come by the end of fiscal year \u201820 and then the rest will phase in. And I did quote cost to achieve which are really one-time costs and then some CapEx. So we feel really good about the synergy numbers and our ability to deliver them.","Operator","The next question will be from [indiscernible] of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning everyone. I guess, there is \u2013 we fielded a few questions today just about the guidance for standalone ConAgra for 2019. And so I was hoping you can help I think just relative to where I guess consensus expectations were for \u201819. It seems like it\u2019s more or less in line, but could you help us bridge I guess a little bit about what\u2019s happening below the operating income line? Is interest expense going to be higher? I understand there won\u2019t be share repurchases, but just trying to get a better understanding of where your \u201819 guide was maybe relative to where expectations were?","Dave Marberger","Yes, sure, Brian. It\u2019s Dave. Let me take a shot at that. So yes, the main reason \u2013 we are not trying to hide anything. The reason we didn\u2019t give EPS guidance for \u201819 is exactly that, because of the transaction and the impact that could have on interest expense and shares, right, given timing of the financing. But if you step back, the big thing I think today because some analysts have factored it in, some have not, is the pension accounting headwind. So, I think we have been very clear as to what the impact of that is and how that needs to be modeled now below the operating margin line. You are right you should assume no share repurchase now. According to our numbers, that doesn\u2019t have a dramatic impact on EPS because of the way the weighted average share calculation works. And then interest expense, I mean I think probably the most prudent thing is to just model it as sort of the standalone business and then obviously when we know more about the timing and financing, then we can modify it from there. So I think if you factor those things in, you will be able to get kind of close to the consensus number. I don\u2019t think you will have a problem. Let me just hit Q1 why I am on it. We did give guidance for Q1. We normally wouldn\u2019t do that, but because of the timing of signing and the estimating closing by the end of the calendar year, we thought it would be prudent to give at least Q1 guidance. And from a sales perspective, it\u2019s pretty consistent with how we finished Q4. We gave guidance on reported, but organic will be pretty consistent with where we were in the fourth quarter. You will notice that the operating margins are lower on a year-on-year basis and that is all timing of SG&A and some transition service income that we had in the prior year that we don\u2019t have in this year. So, that\u2019s just a wrapping on a one-time benefit there, but it\u2019s really timing, because if you look at the full year and the operating margin guidance we give for the full year, you can see improvement. So, it\u2019s a timing thing with SG&A for the first quarter. So hopefully, that gives you enough insight to get you there.","Operator","The next question will be from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Looking back a couple of years now to that Analyst Day, you laid out some long-term supply chain opportunities, including network consolidation and ingredient sourcing. Could you give us an update as to where you were, where you are now on that journey that you saw then in terms of your own COGS realization and then talk about how Pinnacle really changes that and maybe perhaps adds to that? And then relatedly, how do you view your capital expenditure needs for the combined company over the next few years? Thanks.","Dave Marberger","Yes, David, let me start with that. So, yes, we gave very specific guidance and insight at Investor Day on our supply chain operations that we talked about a realized productivity metric and we are on track with everything we laid out. Our realized productivity has been coming in at 3%, a little north of 3%. The thing that we did not call right back then, nobody called right, was inflation, right. We thought inflation was going to be in the low 2%. As I just quoted, we finished at 3.8% this year. So clearly, much more of a headwind than we anticipated at that time, but our productivity programs are tracking right on. In terms of Pinnacle, it\u2019s better to wait till we close and have an Investor Day to get into more of that, but I think Pinnacle has clearly proven their ability to drive productivity and margin improvement. They have had really strong results in that area. And as Sean mentioned in his comments, it\u2019s a strong culture of productivity and cost savings. On the CapEx, I did quote some incremental CapEx related to \u2013 in my cost-to-achieve number. So that\u2019s a number that you can pickup in addition to our base CapEx numbers for each business.","Operator","And the next question will be from Steve Strycula of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steve Strycula","Good morning and congratulations. So a quick question would be on, Sean, for the category overlap, is there anything that jumps off the page when you look at the two portfolios together as to what might draw some attention whether it\u2019s in the frozen business with Hungry-Man or the chili brands? And lastly, are you able to utilize your NOLs for the foundation brands in the Pinnacle portfolio or only for legacy ConAgra? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Let me take that in reverse order. The capital loss carry-forward just so everybody is clear can only be used for preexisting ConAgra assets, so just so everybody has got that. On the other one, we don\u2019t anticipate any antitrust issues. This transaction involves very complementary products, but in highly competitive sectors and it benefits our customers by making ConAgra an even more effective competitor. Now, we are going to be able to deliver more innovation and value to consumers, but we don\u2019t anticipate any antitrust issues here.","Operator","And the next question will be from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning, Jon. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about well maybe bigger picture about the industry and your options, because it seems to me that we go back to a year ago and there will probably be some detail about your timing and extended conversations here. But go back to a year ago when there were some reports about you talking \u2013 valuations are a lot cheaper across the food group, your own fundamentals are a lot better, especially on a relative basis. And maybe \u2013 and you strike this transaction today, I am curious, it clearly makes sense now just like it made sense then, but when you think about other things you could have done in the near-term in the industry, maybe just a comment about what you are seeing \u2013 what today\u2019s transaction maybe says about the industry as a whole and other opportunities? Thanks very much.","Sean Connolly","Sure. Well, in terms of what we look for big, big picture when it comes to M&A, just think about what we are trying to do as a company. We are a lean company, but we are a company that\u2019s focused on growth. And for 3 years, we have been reshaping the portfolio for better margins and better growth profile. So finding \u2013 we have been on the lookout for a while now for a larger, smart synergistic acquisition, but those opportunities tend to be fewer and farther between. And when they come up, it\u2019s important to us that the asset has real legitimate growth potential and the Pinnacle team has done an absolutely phenomenal job driving innovation and growth here and that meant a lot to us. We also have been very clear around our success criteria all along and the announced deal today reflects both an open-minded seller and the ability to meet our criteria. So, it\u2019s a great combination overall and we are looking forward to getting at it.","Operator","And the next question will be from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. I will add my congratulations as well. I just wanted to ask you in relation to synergies, if I could. First of all, are there any explicit revenue synergies you expect from the transaction? And then also just related to that, when you think about the $215 million of synergies, is there any need to invest in say capabilities at Pinnacle, which runs at a really low level of overhead? Is there some investment that you are building into your synergy expectation as well?","Sean Connolly","First, on growth synergies, nothing we have shared today assumes any growth synergies. So, we kind of gave you a preview of directionally how we are thinking about the long-term algorithm of the combined companies and both of these companies have probably among the higher long-term growth forecast as it exists already. So we are not at a point where we are going to change that, but I think it goes without saying that when you take two strong portfolios and you combine them into a single bigger portfolio, just the consistency and the sustainability of that growth profile almost by deductive reasoning has to go up. So, that\u2019s in there. We haven\u2019t baked in any growth synergies. I can tell you I personally have plenty of ideas for our innovation team to start thinking about, but that\u2019s for a conversation down the road. And in terms of capabilities that the Pinnacle team like ConAgra is a lean team, but obviously it is a highly capable team. And so we are really looking forward between now and close to getting to know the team to try to understand what their towering strengths are and frankly we like the idea of continuing to enhance our capabilities by the combination of the two. Dave, you want to add something?","Dave Marberger","Yes. Just so, Chris, on the synergy, the $215 million we put out there. So everything we reflect in our forecast, our accretion estimates of high single-digit by fiscal \u201822 reflects all the costs we need to incur to get there. I do want to remind everybody too, because companies do this differently. Our accretion estimates include amortization of intangibles, the estimated purchase accounting on this transaction. Lot of companies just quote cash EPS accretion. If we were to look at cash EPS accretion, we are double-digits. So we are quoting EPS accretion as a GAAP number that includes amortization estimates. I just want to make sure that\u2019s clear, because sometimes it\u2019s confusing.","Operator","And the next question will be from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, Sean. Can you help give a little more color on the decision to reduce the advertising line item in SG&A or just the direct-to-consumer kind of approach and push more in terms of retailer spending? Do you foresee any kind of long-term impact on your brands as a result of that? And what makes you feel comfortable that the spending with the retailer is going to be sufficient to maintain, I guess, the intangible equities?","Sean Connolly","Well, I think the answer to the question is we expect that the long-term impact to our brands is positive. We view it as a positive change. For almost a year now, we have been outspoken about the marketing ROI improvement we believe we could get by moving some ineffective A&P marketing investments to retailer marketing investments. And accordingly, we have shifted some of our investments above net sales and it is clearly working. Our sales are up. Our promotion levels remain reduced and our pricing is ahead of our categories on average. And because we plan to maintain this marketing profile coupled with the pension accounting change, we needed to true up our algorithm, but fundamentally, nothing has changed. But I\u2019d like to give you just a case study here, because I think your question is really about is this a lower quality marketing investment and is it ultimately going to hurt brand equities over time? The opposite is actually true, Rob. We are seeing very different marketing programs with customers today than when I started out in the industry and it was all high low trade. Look at Healthy Choice as an example. Healthy Choice is about a $400 million brand at retail. It had been declining for years. We have modernized the brand. We are investing with customers to make sure we get the right placement and get the product clearly in front of consumers when they are shopping. And in Q4 that $400 million business at retail grew its top line about 20%. So, that is unheard of to see a brand of that scale that\u2019s been around that long that was that outdated, put up those kinds of trends.","And I would say it\u2019s a combination of both the below-the-line marketing spend and the above-the-line spend, but the total marketing spend has actually increased and it is far more effective and the investments we are making above the line are not in contrast to building brand equity. They actually enhance brand equity. The easy one to describe is when we make an investment with e-tailers as an example on search. Search is a bit of a pay-to-play game. But by paying to play, we are able to get the story of our brands in front of consumers so they understand the ingredients, they understand the founders, they understand all of that. That is good old-fashioned brand building and it is a far superior investment than buying a commercial on Home and Garden TV at 2:30 in the morning on the Thursday night. So overall, we feel excellent about the shift. It\u2019s working. We plan to continue to do it and that\u2019s why we are truing it up, so you guys can model it properly.","Operator","The next question will be from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Alexia. Good morning.","Alexia Howard","Do you have any read at the moment about how quickly your de-levering will happen to get from 5x to 3.5x?","Dave Marberger","Yes, Alexia. So that\u2019s clearly our target. Right now, we are looking at a glide path assuming we would close by the end of the calendar year. By the end of fiscal \u201821, we should be pretty close to the 3.5x.","Operator","And the next question will be from Rob Dickerson of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you very much. Congrats from me as well. Just a broader question really, your own perspective, Sean, as to really why upon the announcement this morning both the ConAgra shares and the Pinnacle shares are obviously \u2013 have come under some near-term pressure. And from my perspective, it sounds like this is the transaction that\u2019s kind of been a long time coming and it made logical sense and there is obvious value creation, and you have outlined that today. So really just very simplistically just why do you think both stocks are down and why would you be happy owning ConAgra equity, especially if you were a Pinnacle shareholder? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Rob, I am not going to speculate as to what the market is going to do in the course of a couple of hour window. What I can tell you is I have total confidence that by combining these two companies we will only accelerate the strong shareholder value creation track record that we have been delivering. There has been a lot of commentary about deals that perhaps don\u2019t make sense to investors in recent days. These are two portfolios that fit perfectly together and in fact looking at it right now, I think it\u2019s just an outstanding investment opportunity.","Dave Marberger","And just to add to what Sean says, with our information today, we are putting a lot out there and there is a lot of things like the pension reclassifications, our shift of A&P. Looking at that the wrong way, people could look at that as, oh, your operating margins are down or gross margin, you didn\u2019t hit the 32%, when that\u2019s not correct. But we tried in the materials to be very descriptive as to what we are doing here. So I think as people look at it and understand, wait a minute, actually, the core business is doing very strong. I just wonder if there is a little bit of confusion given all the changes that are taking place in our numbers, just another opinion.","Operator","And the next question will be from David Driscoll of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Cornell Burnette","Good morning. This is actually Cornell Burnette on with a few questions for David. Just wanted to ask you obviously when you look at the deal, some of the logic of bringing the Pinnacle Foods\u2019 frozen assets and combining them with ConAgra seems pretty obvious, just wondered your take on maybe some of the parts of the portfolio at Pinnacle that are less obvious with ConAgra. And I am thinking of things such as like baking mixes and perhaps salad dressings and wondering kind of over the long-term, how do you see that fitting in with what you want to do and is this like a good long-term fit for the company?","Sean Connolly","Yes, those two examples that you bring up are actually examples of excellent fits. We talk about our portfolio as spanning four consumer domains, frozen meals, snacks and sweet treats, condiments and enhancers and shelf-stable meals and sides, Duncan Hines, if you look at the fantastic innovation that\u2019s come out of Pinnacle team on Duncan Hines in the last year or so, it\u2019s really demonstrating that Duncan Hines operates well as a sweet treat, a convenient sweet treat and we think there is real innovation opportunity still ahead there and it fits squarely with what we do in sweet treats where we have great brands like Swiss Miss and Snack Packs. So, that\u2019s very close to home for us. Within our center store grocery business, we do look at it two ways, condiments and enhancers and shelf-stable meals and sides, both of those businesses play important roles. But interestingly, when you look at millennial behavior in particular, they are very interested in condiments and enhancers as a simple way to add flavor, texture, moisture to food and obviously, the Wish-Bone business kind of is \u2013 it fits very close to home with what we do with brands like Hunt\u2019s ketchup, Frontera salsa, things like that. So, it\u2019s actually extremely close in. I struggle to find something in the Pinnacle portfolio that\u2019s actually not close in when I look at it. These are categories that are very similar to the kinds of benefits that we bring to consumer households everyday.","Operator","The next question will be from Akshay Jagdale of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Lubi Kutua","Good morning. This is actually Lubi filling in for Akshay. I just wanted to ask a bit of a big picture question. So you have obviously completed a number of acquisitions. You have done some divestitures over the last few years as part of your portfolio reshaping efforts and obviously you still have a fair amount of the tax loss carry-forward remaining to do more. So I am just wondering at a high level in terms of your portfolio reshaping efforts, how close do you think you are to being at sort of an optimal portfolio mix? And are there any sort of particular segments of the market where you feel you are maybe under or overexposed, such that 5 years from now in a perfect world, are there any parts of the portfolio that might look probably meaningfully different than where we are today? Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Yes. Lubi, I think the big picture view on what we do as brand builders, is we look externally at what is working with the consumer and then we constantly or we should be refine our portfolio and modernize our brands, so that they are meeting emerging and current consumer trends, not yesterday\u2019s trends. So, that means everything is always in a state of flux in terms of the way our brands present themselves to consumers and there maybe over the course of 10, 15 years, you may see certain segments improve their growth rates and certain slowing. You have to be agile and flexible and go with that. For us right now, as I have said many times, I see years and years and years of runway in frozen. Frozen is a big piece of real estate in the grocery store that just recently is beginning to undergo the kind of modernization that it needs. And I think there is a long way to go there. Also for us, we see a clear opportunity in snacks and sweet treats. We have a $2 billion snack business at retail. It plays in the four of the fastest growing snack sub-segments around and now we are going to be able to add some snacks assets to that mix with some of the Pinnacle snack brands. So, those are the two biggies. We see surgical opportunities in condiments and enhancers as we have talked previously, but I\u2019d say, frozen and snacking are the two areas where we will continue to put the most momentum.","Operator","And the next question will be from Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Pamela Kaufman","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you can comment on how you are evaluating potential divestiture candidates across the portfolio. And just related to that, I know you said that you don\u2019t envision any antitrust issues, but is this view taking into account potentially divesting assets where there could be overlap? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Well, I think we are really \u2013 again, we don\u2019t anticipate any antitrust issues. When it comes to divestiture strategy more broadly, we have been on the record a long, long time saying that M&A is part of our strategy and we expect inbounds and as we reshape the portfolio, we expect some outbound things and we can do that very efficiently. With this announcement and the fact that the whole world basically knows we have a capital loss carry-forward tax asset, I think it\u2019s plausible that somebody could inquire about an asset that they covet. And we have always been open-minded to that as evidenced by the actions we have taken on Spicetec, Swank, Del Monte, Wesson, etcetera and we will continue to be open-minded if it makes good strategic and financial sense.","Operator","And the next question will be from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Okay, thank you for taking the questions. Just a quick clarification for me. In terms of the pro forma leverage target of 5x that you see at deal close, it\u2019s indicated that, that\u2019s on a net basis. As we think about the 3.5x target that you have laid out there is that also on a net basis or is that on a gross basis? Thank you.","Dave Marberger","It\u2019s on a gross basis. So, the 5x and yes, it\u2019s on a gross basis.","Operator","And with that, we will close the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Brian Kearney for any closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","Great. Thank you.

All audience lines are currently in a listen only mode, however our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the formal question and answer session.","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce your host from ConAgra Foods for today\u2019s program, Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; John Gehring, Chief Financial Officer and Chris Klinefelter, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Klinefelter, please go ahead. ","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter call.

And good morning, everyone. In my comments this morning, I'll recap our fiscal fourth quarter performance including comparability matters, and address cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. I'll also provide some brief comments regarding fiscal 2016. Let's start with our performance. Overall, the fiscal fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our revised expectation. For the full fiscal year we reported a fully diluted loss per share from continuing operations of a $1.46 versus earnings of $0.37 last year. Adjusting for items impacting comparability fully diluted earnings per share was $2.18 versus our prior year comparable earnings base of $2.17. ","Turning to our fourth quarter results. We reported net sales of $4.1 billion, about 4% above the year ago quarter, reflecting the benefit from the extra week. The extra week overall contributed approximately 7% to the fiscal fourth quarter net sales in volume for each operating segment. We reported diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a $0.47 versus a loss of $0.95 in the year ago period. The sharp increase in reported EPS from the year ago period was driven by significant non-cash impairment charges recorded in the year ago quarter. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share were $0.59, about 7% above comparable year ago amounts. The EPS growth was largely driven by the approximate $0.04 per share contribution from the extra week which benefited each of the segments. ","Now I'll share a few comments on our segment performance. Starting with Consumer Foods segment where net sales were approximately $1.9 billion for the quarter, up about 4% from the year ago period, reflecting a 5% volume increase, a 1% improvement in price mix, a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange and some rounding. The extra week favorably impacted sales and volume by approximately 7% for the quarter. Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $319 million or up about 20% from the year ago period, reflecting overall good execution on key initiatives to strengthen the business and position it for fiscal 2016.","The increase in operating profit reflects the higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher marketing and SG&A cost. Gross margin expanded over 200 basis points versus the year ago quarter and the increase was driven by pricing, mix improvement and cost savings. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $24 million on net sales and about $14 million on operating profit for the segment this fiscal quarter. ","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results. This quarter cost savings were approximately $75 million and largely offset inflation of about 3%. Inflation was driven by cost increases on certain inputs particularly proteins. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $59 million, up about 13% from the prior year quarter.","In our Commercial Foods segment net sales were approximately $1.2 billion, or up about 7% from the prior year quarter. Results were driven by an 8% volume increase primarily reflecting the benefit of the 53rd week and good execution across all of the businesses in the segment. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit was $154 million or 3% above the comparable operating profit in the year ago period. The operating profit increased principally reflects the benefits from higher net sales, partially offset by lower gross margin at Lamb Weston due to higher manufacturing and distribution costs related to the West Coast port issue. ","Our Private Brand segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1 billion, down about 1% from the prior year quarter, reflecting a 4% volume decline and slightly favorable price mix. The extra week favorably impacted sales and volume by approximately 7% for the quarter. Operating profit excluding items impacting comparability was approximately $31 million, down 30% from the prior year quarter. This decline reflects the soft volume performance and margin compression driven by product mix, commodity inflation and lower overhead of source. ","Sean will have more to say about our plans to divest this business in his comments. Moving on to corporate expenses for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $62 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $65 million versus $59 million in the year ago quarter. The increased versus last year's fourth quarter reflects higher incentive costs and the impact of the extra week. Equity method investment earnings were higher this quarter due to the addition of earnings from the Ardent Mills joint venture. ","On comparability matters, this quarter's reported EPS include approximately $0.12 per diluted share of net expenses. As detailed in the release, these items include following approximate amount. $0.09 per diluted share of net expense related to the impairment of goodwill and other assets principally in the Private Brand segment. $0.05 per diluted share of net expense resulting from restructuring and integration costs. $0.03 per diluted share of net benefit related to the mark-to-market impact of derivatives used to hedge input costs temporarily classified and unallocated corporate expense. And $0.01 per diluted share of net expense related to mark-to-market adjustments of pension amounts. ","To be clear we do not treat the contribution from the 53rd week of approximately $0.04 per share as comparability item as it has been in our guidance all year.","On cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with $183 million of cash on hand no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Operating cash flows for fiscal 2015 were approximately $1.47 billion, down modestly from our previous estimate due primarily to higher working capital balance. On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $154 million versus $117 in the prior year quarter. And for the full fiscal year of CapEx was approximately $472 million, somewhat lower than our previous estimate. Net interest expense was $89 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $93 million in the year ago quarter. And dividends for this fiscal quarter were $107 million versus $105 million in the year ago quarter.","On capital allocation, we are pleased that we are able to repay approximately $1.1 billion of debt this fiscal year and $2.1 billion since the Ralcorp acquisition, modestly exceeding our $2 billion goal. This quarter we repurchased about $12 million of shares and as we enter fiscal 2016, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and a capital allocation strategy approximately balanced between a top tier dividend, share repurchases and additional growth investments. ","Now I'd like to provide a few comments on fiscal 2016. Given the uncertainty around the planned divesture of the Private Brands business particularly related to timing, structure, price, use of proceeds and stranded cost impacts, as well as the need to finalize our investment plans for the rest of the business and evaluate the impact of our SG&A and other cost savings initiatives, we are not in a position today to provide comparable EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. At such time as we have more details regarding the plan divesture, investment plans and cost savings program, we will provide more details on our outlook. We currently expect that fiscal 2016 fiscal first quarter will not be significantly impacted by the aforementioned factors. And the company expects EPS adjusted for items impacting comparability for the fiscal first quarter of 2016 to be roughly in line with comparable year ago amounts. ","That concludes my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Sean for an update on his analysis of the company, the work he has been leading and the exciting path forward for ConAgra Foods. Sean? ","Sean Connolly","Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. I am delighted to be here with you on my first call since joining ConAgra Foods. As you know, I've been in deep study on our business, our capabilities and our culture since I walked in the door on March 3rd. My detailed review of the company has largely confirmed the perspective that I had coming in. The crux of which was if the company is prepared to move quickly and to take bold actions on a number of fronts, there is meaningful value to be created. Importantly, before I started the Board made it clear to me they fully understood the misstep that had occurred at ConAgra and assured me that I would have the latitude to make the moves that I felt were necessary to best drive value creation. They made it clear that they wanted me to bring change. They have given me their full support to pursue any path following appropriate due diligence that will create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. I have approached this process objectively and while the team and I have not completed our work, I am in a position today to share our overarching philosophy about value creation and some very substantive elements of our emerging base plan. I think you will see we are quite clear eyed about the need for change. It all starts with our strongly held and overarching philosophy about value creation. That philosophy is simple but it is also unwavering. We will always remain open to any actionable pathway that maximizes value for our shareholders. At the same time, we also know that improving the fundamentals of a business is management's job. So we must be aggressively mobilized against a base plan we have full confidence in. These notions are not at odds with one another but rather they reflect a pragmatic and flexible dedication to value creation. So you should expect us to continuously explore and evaluate alternative pathways thoroughly, analyzing how much value can they really create, how certain is the execution and how long will they take to come to fruition. Yes, an alterative path emerges that is clearly superior to our base plan, we will alter course. Certainly, we acknowledge there is healthy debate in the market around the question of whether an alternative path should be pursued sooner or later or ever. The answer to that question obviously depends on how actionable and how valuable that alternative path turns out to be. That is precisely why this work needs to be ongoing and why it always requires careful analysis to ensure our shareholders get the best possible return on their investment. At the same time, as stewards of the business, our threshold point is a base plan that can materially improve our performance. This base plan is what we are sharing with you today. Change is needed and we have a responsibility to perform better in the market place. We know that the inconsistency of our past performance is totally unacceptable. And we need to raise our game such that when we make a long-term commitment, we deliver it. We are highly confident that we can implement the changes operationally and culturally that will enable just that. It will of course take time. It will also require a different approach, but that approach has delivered before. So with that as a foundational backdrop let's move on to my observations on the business and the highlights of what our plan entails.","While we've seen some bright spots over the past year like the strong profit and margin improvement within Consumer Brands and the continued strong performance of Lamb Weston, those bright spots have been overshadowed by inconsistency, volatility and disappointments in our operating performance particularly from Private Brands. The management team knows where we have been. It is time to act to create a different future. Frankly, aspects of the situation are not all that different from when I joined Sara Lee and led the transformation into Hillshire brands. There we turned in aging and underperforming food company into a more energized, agile performer capable of creating significant value as a standalone company. Many of you know the story. At Hillshire, we reinvigorated iconic brand that had become stale and return them to growth. We redefined what lean looks like, took out a lot of inefficiency and cost and instilled a culture of ownership behavior. We created flexibility by taking steps to ensure we had a strong balance sheet. Then we modernize the portfolio through innovation and M&A. We acquired on trend brands, they complicated our capabilities and we divested non strategic assets. And while we drove a double digit EPS CAGR through our daily focus on improving the fundamentals, we never lost our openness to alternative pathways to maximizing value. A remind of the story because here at ConAgra Foods we have a similar philosophy and an equally clear vision of what our base plan looks like. In short, that plan has four pillars. One; divest our Private Brands business for greater focus. Two; aggressively pursue SG&A reductions and productivity improvements to drive margin expansion. Three; grow our Consumer Foods and Lamb Weston businesses through portfolio and capability improvements. And four; maintain a balanced capital allocation philosophy. The substance of our plan comes not only from the thorough analysis we've done and the feedback we solicited from investors, but importantly from the hands on experience of having done it before. As you can imagine, I've been eager to discuss the details of the decisive action plans we are on the path to implementing, and I'll touch on each of these base plan imperatives during my remarks today. ","As John pointed our we are not yet in a position to provide forward looking guidance on the financial outcomes of this plans, we will share that detail with your at an Investor Day later this year after we've completed our work. Most important aspect of that we will be having a more concrete view of the economics of a Private Brands divesture. Before I jump into specifics of our action plans for reinvigorating ConAgra Foods, I want to share a few thoughts on my assessment of the situation. I'll start by saying that I have been pleasantly surprised by the organic prospects of ConAgra Foods and believe we have reasons to be optimistic. ","In fact, some good works were already underway when I arrived. For example, we begun the SG&A reduction process and we started on portfolio segmentation in the branded consumer business. In addition, we had terrific things going on in Lamb Weston. But overall the status quo is simply not acceptable and I am resolute in my belief that unlocking our potential requires major change. Change will encompass everything from portfolio mix and segmentation to more aggressive SG&A reduction, to acquiring new talent and capabilities to compensation metrics and culture. And I am confident it can be done. ","This view comes after objectively evaluating our current portfolio to determine where we are best position to win going forward and where we are not. It reflects a careful assessment of our organization and systems and feedback from customers and investors. You can accurately conclude that the plans we will begin to share today have been arrived at after months of careful study and deliberation. ","Before I go in further, let me assure you I am clear -eyed around the challenges in our industry and within some of our categories. These are not new. But when I look at ConAgra Foods I do see opportunities. Getting at these opportunities requires a clear plan and aligned team. The Board and management team are 100% aligned to drive this change agenda. I want to be very clear that the base plan is not an overnight fix. There are some things we will fully complete in fiscal 2016, but others will be a multiyear effort. And we'll say more about that in due time. ","That said let me preview some of the most critical elements of our plan for remaking ConAgra Foods into a focused, higher margin, more contemporary and higher performing company. As I mentioned earlier, the first step in our plan we will be the divesture of our Private Brands business. While we are taking the right steps to improve our execution and began restoring this business to previous levels, we believe the better investment of our resources is on other priorities where our capabilities are more mature. This business has real potential and the Private Brands segment of the retail class of trade continuous to grow. But we have to come to conclusion that this asset will be more valuable outside of ConAgra Foods. We did not come to this conclusion lightly. We've carefully evaluated our options for this business. This work culminated in a meeting on June 10th at which the Board authorized us to develop and pursue a plan to divest this business. We believe there will be significant interest from potential buyers to support a transaction that is acceptable in terms of value and structure. We will continue our work to improve execution but believe the best outcome for value creation will be successful divesture. ","Our goal here is straightforward. We are driving toward a more focused corporate strategy; the realization of proceeds associated with a fair value sale for the benefit of shareholders and potentially tax assets. The likes of which could enable additional tax efficient portfolio shaping down the road. We believe that a divesture of Private Brands will meaningfully accelerate our progress against our pursuit of change and value creation. While we won't be giving regular updates on the divesture process, we will report out when we have something material to say.","The second step in our plan is a margin expansion commitment stemming from a more aggressive approach to SG&A and continued progress in supply chain and trade productivity. On SG&A, we are well into mobilizing an intensive SG&A reduction effort that is aimed not only at offsetting stranded cost associated with a Private Brands divesture, but moving ConAgra into the top quartile of SG&A efficiency in our space over time. In fact, shortly after I arrived at the company, I enlisted some outstanding, outside help to contribute to our aggressive push on SG&A. That push will be on four key levers across all our SG&A function. Those four levers are: first zero basing, meaning aggressively challenging whether what we do today adds value to our business and customers. Second; spans and layers, uncovering opportunities to flatten our organization to bring us closer to customers, speed up decision making and eliminate hierarchy. Third; outsourcing, meaning shifting some back office work to third party providers who can perform this work at a lower cost and in a more scalable manner. And four; building a performance culture where we create stronger accountability and meritocracy mindset. ","Our approach to this work will be relentless. Absolutely everything is on the table. And when I say we can achieve these things over time, that is because some of this work will require system and capability improvements that are not turnkey, nevertheless if we find in efficiency we will get it out as fast as possible. We will keep you updated on this effort but I can assure you we've been hard at work on this since the day I arrived. Because a low ConAgra Foods was farther along on cost than I expected and SG&A is already below many large cap peers, there is more we must do. We just closed fiscal 2015 with SG&A in the range of 10% of net sales, that is better than some but it is simply not good enough. Expect SG&A efficiency to be a never ending quest at ConAgra. It will be cultural where we just don't tolerate waste. ","Again this work will take time to fully realize but we will get the job done. On supply chain productivity, we've an excellent history of delivering meaningful gross productivity improvement year after year. As you know, productivity improvements get harder to realize over time. That's why we look to best practices from outside of the company to drive maximum impact. For example, we have access to world class intellectual property design to assist us and improving the operating efficiency of our manufacturing facilities. We've recently expanded our access to that IT and see real potential for additional margin expansion through these capabilities. On trade, you know this is an area where all CPGs spend a lot of money and you know it tends to be fairly inefficient. We have lot of work to do here but the opportunity is real and we are on our way to eliminate waste and implementing the types of process improvement that will drive better returns. ","Now the third step of our plan is to grow our Consumer Foods and Lamb Weston businesses through portfolio and capability improvements. On our branded consumer business I like our prospects and I'll elaborate with more detail in a minute. But big picture we have several number one or number two brands and they are diversified across a number of large categories many of which have distinct growth opportunities. We believe this is a better profile than when a company has too much of its sales and profit base concentrated in one or two categories that suffer from secular decline. The key of course is being highly effective at brand building and innovation and surgically applying those skills to the brands with the most top and bottom line potential. Given that you should expect us to undertake an intensive segmentation approach to managing our brands and defining their role and performance expectations in the portfolio. This reflects the financial discipline and market based realism we bring to managing a branded portfolio well. We will be declarative about the areas where we will invest more, and the areas where we intend to manage for cash. As I noted earlier, this sharpen prioritization is already underway. ","In addition, when we invest we have to get more leverage from our capabilities and consumer insights, brand building and innovation. Expect heightened focus in this critical area. And as I just mentioned, we will become more efficient in areas like trade on the back of improved analytics and better work processes. We also intend to actively work towards filling in portfolio gaps in critical areas like organic natural and premium gourmet. In fact, we believe ConAgra Foods would benefit from further acquisitions in the consumer branded space given our scale and emerging capabilities. But this point speaks to the need for us to maintain a strong balance sheet with ample fire power as we seek to balance returning capital to shareholders with investing back into the business and on strategic acquisitions. Paying down debt will continue to be a priority. ","Those of you who know me well understand I know this playbook well. I believe in it and I am confident we can execute against it over time. And frankly, we have a lot to work with. We are the number one player in single served frozen meals and continued to gain share in this attractive segment of frozen foods. We had good momentum in iconic category leading brands like Reddi-wip, PAM and Slim Jim. We have several strong scale brands like Marie Callender's and Hunt's that are ready for and responsive to advertising and promotion. And we have reliable contributors that generate strong cash flow and margins consider Peter Pan, Manwich and Hebrew National. ","We are broadly -- we will attack our portfolio in new ways for ConAgra Foods. For example, there may be brands that over time could find better homes elsewhere. We will actively consider monetizing those assets to few other investments when appropriate. We have dynamic smaller brands like Alexia, Rotel -- and Rotel that need nurturing to scale their rapid growth profile. And finally, when it comes to innovation our focus needs to be squarely on three on trend areas. Premium natural, ultra convenience and alternate channels. While early days our game plan around on trend areas is already underway. We just added Blake's All Natural to our portfolio; although small it rounds out our leading presence in pot pies with a brand equity that resonates with the natural and organic consumer. ","On our core business in fiscal year 2016, we plan to increase our support on select brands that have clearly demonstrated the ability to profitably grow like Reddi-wip, Slim Jim, Marie Callender's and Hunt's. And finally, we are supporting major innovations to contemporize two our larger brands, Banquet and Healthy Choice. On Banquet, we are taking action to meaningfully contemporize the brand. We've redesigned the product to improve quality and we've added higher protein premium tier. We've improved packaging and we are investing in AMP. On Healthy Choice, we've previously built a winner with Cafe Steamers, and now we are taking it to the next level with a clean label nothing artificial 100% natural high protein line called Simply. ","In total, I am confident that these kinds of efforts will be the keys that unlock our brand and consumer foods segments ability to further improve its margin profile over time. As you heard from John, the segment made good progress here already in Q4. ","Shifting to Lamb Weston which is the largest part of our Commercial Foods segment, the story is quite simple. This is a great business with built-in international growth potential. In fact, we already have a substantial base internationally and we are investing for more growth as we steep to capture a share of emerging markets comparable to our North America share where we are already the leader in frozen potato products. QSR industry is exploding internationally with potatoes a critical part of the menu. Increasingly these customers are carrying multiple cuts or fries in the same store. Further with the breakfast day part so strong here domestically, we continue to project solid results here on the home front. Lamb Weston also plays an important role in our retail business domestically contributing to our scale in frozen retail overall. We have a great brand at frozen potato business with well known licensed brand names like Arby's and Red Robin along with Alexia, the terrific natural brand I mentioned earlier. Alexia has been growing steadily and offer significant potential in branded frozen potatoes, frozen vegetables and beyond. ","As far as Lamb Weston's priorities this year, our plan is focused on sustainable growth levers. Here North America, we will be restoring our food service operator marketing campaign after several years of zero investment. While this is not a lot of money is a key part of staying relevant and top of mind with operators. On the international front, we will be investing in feet on the street in key international markets where we have a powerful opportunity to gain share with key customers. ","Overall, these kinds of investments are consistent with our commitment to surgically back those elements of our portfolio that offer outsized, top and bottom line opportunities. And that brings me to the fourth aspect of our plan for remaking ConAgra Foods, underpinning all of this will be our long-term commitment to having an investment grade balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation strategy. On this latter point, we are fully committed to a top tier dividend and at the appropriate time more significant share repurchases. ","Now before I open it up questions, let me step back and summarize what I just told you. Our overarching philosophy on value creating is to always remain open to any pathway that maximizes its value. We assess these regularly and are prepared to act as opportunities emerge. We also know that we need a base plan that we have absolute conviction can make ConAgra Foods a far better company than it has been. That plan sticks to simplify our portfolio, strengthen our focus through a divesture of Private Brands and on the cost front we will be relentless in enhancing productivity across SG&A, supply chain and trade spending. We will also place and intense focused on driving profitable growth in Consumer Foods and Lamb Weston. This will require further portfolio segmentation and investing behind the highest potential categories in a disciplined manner. To support our plan we expect to make investments in marketing, innovation and acquisitions. We also expect additional divestures may occur down the road as we continue to refine our asset mix. ","And finally, we are committed to the balanced capital allocation strategy I just mentioned. Expect to hear from us later this year at an Investor Day where we will provide financial and operating details about what I discussed today. With that John and I will be happy to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital. ","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody. And so two questions from me. First just one on Private Brands. I guess up until may be a quarter or two ago, the Board and it seemed pretty resolute that the issues in Private Brands really were not structural meaning not an issue of putting Private Brands and branded together and much more just executional in nature. So I am trying to get a sense of with you coming in with a fresh perspective on it, what led you to determine that, that's no longer the case and that it really is something more structural with respect to this business. And then I got a follow up.","Sean Connolly","Yes. I don't know that I said I believe structural at all, Andrew. I think there is certainly upside from recent levels. And this business can be much stronger over time. The issue we faced is a different one. We think it will take a lot more time and effort to get this business where it needs to be. And our view is that it should be done by somebody else instead of us so that we can focus on opportunities that pay off earlier by comparison. ","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Thank you for that. And then when you think about some of the work that you are going to want to do and undertake and the core sort of Consumer Foods business going forward. And the type of investments that you may want sort of putting to that. Is it fair to say that -- obviously you will be more aggressive on cost to try and cover some of these but that you will probably need more whether it's on the marketing front, on the high quality marketing side and just as we think even broadly forward we should think about additional investment maybe first off to kind of see what you want to do. And I am talking more like the typical sort of rebase that comes with a new CEO with a new plan. Just trying to get a sense of how you feel about that. ","Sean Connolly","Well, we are not going to provide guidance today in terms of what the full year looks like. But I don't think it's going to be new news to anybody that the company has historically under invested in the brand side of the -- branded side of the portfolio. So we plan and investment more in marketing as the brands can handle it. And I think that's the key phrase is they can handle it as they are as we call it AMP ready and as the margins allow but the key is and I think you know this from my previous philosophy on marketing spend. You have to bring in an incredibly strong discipline here. You just don't go start spending money because you think it is going to work. You can only invest where you have full confidence that you can drive margin expansion and you can drive a good return on that investment. So when I think about increasing marketing spend, I think of it in terms of words like being surgical and extremely disciplined about where you can get a return. So the notion of dramatically jacking up spending levels for the sake of getting back on the horse does not make sense, and that's not the kind of play you will see us run. You'll see us being more surgical and be more disciplined as we move forward just try to strengthen our branded portfolio.","Operator","And we move now to David Driscoll with Citi Research. ","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask when the Ralcorp business was purchased; there was an expectation of something like $300 million in synergies. And when you contemplate the divesture of this, the synergy is not actually been realized at this point and so they kind of would be out there in the consensus forecast of ConAgra's earnings. So how do you guys think about this when Private Brands is sold, what happens to that $300 million of expected savings? Let me just stop right there and may be ask a follow up after you respond.","John Gehring","Yes, David, this is John. Let me take a shot at that. First I would say is we have in fact been able to drive a lot of cost out, the problem is the other issues in the business and particularly some of the pricing and margin, other margin pressures have created situations where we clearly have not seen that come through. There have been some synergies that have actually manifest themselves in other parts of business in terms of some of the leverage we got from some of the buys, so there is a little bit of that shows up in consumer but I think as we look forward this is a matter of whatever we were expecting or anybody else is expecting out of Private Brands, I think become somewhat irrelevant as we focus back on the consumer and commercial businesses. It is really about continuing to drive cost savings and margin expansion that we've seen particular in the consumer business over last quarter to continue that trend. So in terms of a total company model I am not sure the synergy number from several years ago really lives on going forward. ","David Driscoll","Yes. I am always worried that the synergies filter into different lines not just the private label line hence the importance of the question. Two quick follow ups. What was Private Brands' EBITDA in 2015? And is it fair to say that your target leverage going forward post anything would be something like around 2x, would that satisfy your statement of wanting to be solidly investment grade if I were just to try put flag in the sand for a ballpark figure. ","John Gehring","Well, first of all on the EBITDA for Private Brands, I'd say on a normalized basis it is probably in the mid [300], I don't want get to a point estimate in terms of debt to EBITDA, the broad range I used right now as we seek to be priced somewhere 2x and 3x. Obviously, if were three our capital allocation priorities probably a little bit shifted and if we got to two probably say we have plenty of fire power to do more investments. So it is all going to be I think depended upon where we are at point and time and what opportunities in front of us. ","Operator","And Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research has our next question.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks very much. Sean, you mentioned you did some intense study. I mean could you give us a couple of example of what you think -- what convinces you to take such long time to fix the Private Brands business and a couple of examples of why you think that maybe someone externally might be able to do that little bit more quickly. ","Sean Connolly","Well, Jonathan, it is fair question but I don't think my contemplation and my analysis was really just about Private Brands. I have been under hood on every single piece of this company to try understand where the opportunity is and how resource intensive the work would be in order to accomplish what we see as the opportunity in those different parts. And our conclusion is that there is significant opportunity with this company to create value but we need to be focused and we need to have our resources squarely lined up against areas where our capabilities are more matured, where we can get the most impact on the fastest possible timetable, and ultimately that led me and the Board to make a decision that we need to focus. We need to prioritize and we need to get squarely focused on driving the kind of aggressive change agenda that I just laid out for you in my comments a few minutes ago. So this is about making the tough call and prioritizing around those actions that we believe can drive maximum return for our shareholders and that includes an immediate divesture of our Private Brands business and that's why we are working that process. ","Jonathan Feeney","Okay. May be I can ask little different way. I guess why-- certainly different philosophies on this but one might think that maybe a tactically better approach might have been to execute some sort of sale divesture before deciding on this plan. Could you maybe tell us a little bit about why the decision to sort of go public with this, change in direction without having anything necessarily lined up at the moment?","Sean Connolly","Well, we haven't gone public with it; you probably would have found out about it anyway one way or another. So we thought it would just be best part our shareholders to understand the big picture of our plan. I mean what we are laying out for you today is clearly different direction. I don't think there is any need to keep that a secret while we are working at behind the scenes. We've got a base plan, we have tremendous confidence in, and we have an overarching philosophy around how to create value for our shareholders that we always keep running side by side our base plan. And we have full confidence there is upside in this Private Brands business but we also believe that should be done by somebody else instead of us so that we can focus on these other opportunities that we need to get after with some urgency. ","Operator","And we will hear question now from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. ","Ken Goldman ","Hi, good morning, everybody. Sean, thank you for the color this morning, it is appreciated. One question I wanted to follow up on, you were pretty open about saying look this is the plan. But if a better plan comes up that is more accretive to shareholder value that you will certainly consider it. What one of those possibilities be to investing Consumer Foods. And the reason I am asking that specifically is if you divest the Private Brands and then you divest Consumer Foods there is not much left in Omaha. And there are political issues probably with the Board and with a lot of other stakeholders and effectively leaving Omaha. So is it I guess my question is it on the table that Consumer Foods could be divested as well? ","Sean Connolly","Ken there was lots of assumptions there in your question. I think I have been pretty clear and consistent in my comments today that our Board of Directors and our management team fully understand the importance of creating shareholder value. And I am sure you understand from my remarks earlier that our philosophy is to always be proactive and open minded in evaluating the different paths to creating value. But we put forth the beginnings of a plan that we are convinced can drive a lot of value on its own. However, it becomes obvious if some other tangible and actionable path is a better way to create value, our Board and our management will adapt accordingly.","Ken Goldman ","Okay. No, I appreciate that and always making many assumptions, but that's what they do on the sale side. question two is you have meeting or set of meetings set up this week I believe with JANA. Can you talk a little bit about in a relationship you have within so far, your expectation going in, just any forward looking thoughts as to what you are anticipating from those meetings? ","Sean Connolly","Sure, no problem. We have not yet spoken with the folks at JANA. But clearly we welcome their feedback as we would with any of our shareholders who are focused on long-term value creation. I think that is common ground that we have with JANA with other investors. I can't offer anything specifically related to JANA other than to say we want a constructive engagement and we will listen to their point of view. They are big shareholders but we've not yet met with them so we don't really have a whole lot more to share or disclose at this point. ","Operator","And we will move now to Jason English with Goldman Sachs. ","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. I want to come back to Mr. Feeney's question on big studies that you have undertaken but attack it more from the cost side. Sean, as you point out, you looks at your SG&A, you benchmark its peer, and it's already relatively low. The rhetoric on getting lean, getting mean, isn't that far off from sort of the message that Gary had over the years that John you've also carried forward, so my question is really where the opportunity is is? As you shake out the study, I heard some of the big buckets you laid out but I was hoping you get a little bit more specific on where you really see opportunity get leaner and meaner here at the SG&A line?","Sean Connolly","Well, the details of kind of what it look, well, first of all I would frame it in terms of margin expansion, Jason, not just SG&A because I do think there is a significant opportunity improve the margin in this company across the board as we get after this things. Certainly SG&A is a big bucket for us; clearly the company has made progress and felt good about kind of that progress when I got here. But my message the day I got in is it doesn't matter how much progress we've made. It is not good enough. We've got more to do. Part of that is exploring the four levers and pushing hard on them that I mentioned today. Part of it's cultural. It's just this getting everybody who is part of our team to understand that any inefficiency and waste is just a tax on our brand and tax on the profits that we return to shareholders. That is a mindset that we will drive. I've already been socializing that idea for months now and people are getting it. They understand how critical it is to get this out. They want to attack all of their orthodoxies that have been held previously. And really get after margin expansion. So SG&A will be a big part of it, with things that I talked about spans and layers all the things you can imagine. Productivity should not be dismissed as well nor trade efficiency. These are all things that over time as we execute them will contribute to what I think could be meaningful improvement in our margin structure. ","Operator","And we will take a question now from RBC, David Palmer.","David Palmer","Good morning. Sean, you mentioned that portfolio mix and segmentation is needed and this seems to mean that trade promotion rationalization, but also perhaps higher spending on certain brands and categories. In the past, it's felt like ConAgra's brands have suffered when the Company planned for a promotion rationalization, the big setbacks often were highlighted as a key competitor punished the -- by grabbing its activity for themselves. And then on the spending side, it's been equally frustrating at times where ConAgra to find good ROI spending. So as we think about this in the segmentation, are there examples or reasons that can help us get our head around why even a more positive approach can work for ConAgra?","Sean Connolly","Well, there is a lot to work with here, David. With the right portfolio refinement and the right investment, this is a good portfolio to post some modest growth and expand margins and redeploy capital. And we are going to be realistic around our industry and our categories. The key is portfolio segmentation and having the right expectations by brand and by categories so that we are matching investment with potential establishing the right goals and delivering results. I mean that is really the key. But I think the phrase that I used in my prepared remarks earlier was a different approach. Every company goes after brand building. Every company goes after innovation and every company goes after trade efficiency with mixed results I might point out. I fully expect we have better results and that's going to come from a number of different areas which is includes a different approaches, it is going to be potentially some new talent that we bring on to the team. This is a piece I understand very well and our effectiveness has to improve meaningfully on the back of better work processes and much more rigorous analytics. But overall anything to drive the branded portfolio is got to be done on a surgical basis with clear eyes. It is not going to be blanket for Andrew's question earlier. That is just not going to happen. And on trade efficiency, I have been doing trade efficiency for a long time, we've got a team of people that are working it with kind of professional over site and we know exactly what we got to do there. The key is you got to have a strong set of brands. If all you have to fall back on is price, it is hard to get more efficient on trade. So you got to have stronger brand. So you got more thought to bring to the table for our customers as we change some things. ","Operator","And we will take a question now from Matt Grainger with Morgan Stanley. ","Matt Grainger ","Hi, good morning, everyone. So just first on Private Brands. I was hoping to get a sense of how you plan to manage the business from a sales capabilities standpoint while the strategic reviews underway. You've been focused for a while on trying to improve execution and also win back business you may have lost. Are those both still going to be near-term priorities? And do you think the profitability margins can improve sequentially during this strategic review process?","Sean Connolly","Well, these are definitely separate stream. The work we've done and the organization changes we've put in place to run this business better to execute more effectively, nothing is going to change there. We've got the right structure now calling on it, we've a clear understanding of how you run this business and what it takes, and we are rebuilding our relationships we've got with customers. So all of that is going to be intact as we run the sale process. However, the pace of path recovery is clearly further out and longer than we expected last year. So that is -- I would not expect any kind of rapid recovery from where we've been. We do expect the segment to be better in 2016 versus 2015 but that progress will happen sequentially as we move through the year given the changes we put in place. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman ","Hi, good morning, everybody. So I have two questions. One on private label and the next on frozen. I guess is there -- with regards to the private label sale, is there a kind of minimum amount that the Board is willing to accept? Because obviously the business is impaired and it's struggled but it does have kind of $4 billion roughly of sales, so I guess is there a limit as to how much of a loss the company is willing to take. And then second -- I think Sean I am trying to think through your career and I don't recall if it ever involved like frozen food or specifically frozen entrees because it seems like that's been the one category since the great recession that has been in serious decline and that's a very big part of the consumer portfolio. And is there something that you see within those brands and within frozen entrees that where maybe the category has bottomed or there something technology that you see within the business today that makes you more comfortable that there can be turn in what's a very important part of the consumer segment. Thank you. ","Sean Connolly","Yes. Let me take those in order, Eric. On the first part of it on Private Brands, as I mentioned earlier we think there is going to be significant interest in these assets and we think we will be able to divest these assets at a fair value that will be acceptable to shareholders and with appropriate structure. And we also believe that we do need to get this behind us so that we can strengthen our focus on our base plan that you heard me layout. So when you do a comparison to make this move now or to make this move later, we are absolutely convinced that from a value creation standpoint it is better to make this move now. With respect to the frozen question. Yes, I have extensive experience in frozen. You may recall at Hillshire brands we had great frozen business anchored by the great Jimmy Dean brand and what I told my investors then is I reject the notion that frozen is a place where you can grow and grow profitably. It is just not grounded in fact. When you look at consumer need state absolutely there are consumer need state, where consumers want fresh and perishable items that they can enjoy with a whole family. But you probably know from your own lives that there are lots of consumer need states where you are eating alone, you don't have a lot of time and it's in those consumer need states where frozen is the absolute perfect solution. The key is the foods got to be good. You got to have good quality food. You got to have a proposition that consumers value and I always use the Jimmy Dean example in my previous live is just when you got great food, the consumer has the need state already there, you are going to be successful. So that's why we have taken the actions we've taken on our business like on Healthy Choice with Caf\u00e9 Steamers which is a clearly superior product than what we sold under the Healthy Choice named previously. And it is working. And now we are taking it to the next step with the clean label 100% natural line. Similarly in Banquet, that is a value tier brand where we recognized when you just look at through in the plain light a day we needed to do better job on food quality. And that's what we've done. We've improved that. And these are the kind of fundamental actions that you need to take to improve performance. So it is not a question of is it the world going to frozen or is the world going to fresh. There are clearly is room for both. Our idea is that we need to make frozen fresh and we need to bring fresh perspective in frozen and that's how you drive profitable growth. ","Operator","And we will move now to Robert Dickerson with Consumer and Research. ","Robert Dickerson ","Thank you. So, Sean, I guess the first question I have maybe sounds a bit simplified but I'd like to hear your take from on the set, I know you are talking about reaching kind of that top tier SG&A level being very aggressive with cost cutting efficiency et cetera but what's your take just by being there for few months as you do your studies just kind of why ConAgra kind of basically just has lower gross margin profile relative to the industry. I just asked because I mean quite frankly as you even point out SG&A as a percent of sales really isn't that bad as we benchmark. But it is really -- is could there be a much larger gross margin opportunity at ConAgra and if so is that something you would be willing to invest behind? Thank you. ","Sean Connolly","Well, Robert, first of all, I think I've said a couple of times there is absolutely a gross margin opportunity at this company. One there is couple of reasons why our gross margin is where it is today. Some of it is we had segment that are clearly at much lower gross margin that drag down a whole private brand obviously is a different gross margin than consumer. But if your comments are largely focused on consumer, there is absolutely an opportunity get gross margin going there but what's interesting about your question is in my experience the way you build strong brands with strong gross margins is you have to invest in them. You got to keep them fresh. You got to keep them relevant. You got to keep them contemporary. And that's exactly why when investors see a company like ours that's committed to margin expansion, part of that recipe I need them to understand is making sure that we have strong and relevant brands because then we got the ability to take price when we see inflation then we got the ability to invest in margin, accretive innovation. This is all part of a flywheel here that moves things in the right direction from a value creation standpoint. So and part of it is capability. So when I think about the over reliance on trade and under reliance on advertising and consumer, that tends to manifest itself in branded portfolios and lower gross margin. That is stuff that we can progress on and we will do just that. ","Operator","We will take a question now from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. And thanks for the color. My question John is about you mentioned the portfolio being an advantage for Consumer Foods, why -- the conclusion that I reaches somewhat the opposite because the playbook that you put forth today is -- it is not similar to what Gary had put together in 2007 being more efficient with trade price, spending more and brand et cetera but quite frankly 60% to 70% of your sales in consumer are in grocery and frozen which has had major challenges from overall category perspective. So can you just talk about why you think grocery incentive store perhaps is not structurally defining category longer term? And then maybe talk about the tax implications because you did mention the sale of this Private Brands asset creating tax shelter that you can use down the road. I mean is the reason why you don't take a more aggressive stands on portfolio pruning maybe consumer that -- is the reason for that being the tax issues or tax implications or just help me understand the portfolio strategy on Consumer Foods. Thanks. ","Sean Connolly","All right. Akshay, let me just correct the couple of things that you said there. Because I don't think they are consistent with what I said before. First of all, we are going to be absolutely realistic about our industry and our categories. So there is no dilution in terms of where different parts of the store can go. Secondly, we are absolutely open to divesting elements of our portfolio down the road and that's part of rigorous portfolio segmentation analysis. I don't have any color, additional colors to add on that right now. But those are key points. With respect to the branded portfolio and the way I see it, while we are very realistic about what these categories are doing, we also see pockets of real interesting growth within many of these categories. So I will pick a category that I didn't talk about today. Not butters, we have Peter Pan peanut butter business but there is very interesting and new start that is happening in a category like nut butters right now. I find that to be interesting because it tends to be margin accretive stuff and it tends to be very high growth. Even if you pick a category where we are the market leader like pot pies where you outside is the pot pie category. I'd argue, it's very exciting category, we've got the market leading brand with Marie Callender's, it is posting robust growth and it is got good margin. However, we also recognize we were not reaching all the consumers who are participating in that category because some had kind of what I'll describe is a different value system around what kind of brands they appreciate. So we went out and we made the acquisition of Blake's All Natural which is also a pot pie where we got tremendous leverage in terms of our ability to manufacture, but it appeals to a different kind of consumer with a natural and organic kind of mindset and that is incremental to the business we already on today. So what's different around the way we will approach these growth opportunities is effectively everything. We are going to pursue different work processes, we are going to have new capabilities and we got completely different approach to getting after these all grounded in a clear eyed realism around what's possible and strong analytics around kind of what we go after very surgically and where we invest. ","Operator","We will move now to Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me okay? Okay, just two questions if I could quickly. I guess little bit follow- on to Akshay's questions and your response, Sean, would just be -- what are -- what's the basis for divestures going forward? There is a place in a portfolio for growth businesses as well as cash flow brand, I am just curious if there is something you are targeting? Is it sort of category that's off trend or that kind of thing. And then secondarily if I could ask what Lamb Weston would -- your expected growth profile for that brand going -- for that business going forward particularly with its international focus?","Sean Connolly","In reverse order Chris, I will hold on the Lamb Weston question because we will give more perspective on and much more detail on that business and the growth prospects when we do our Investor Day. On the question regarding potential divesture candidates, I really think it is just come down to basic principle. We don't have anything to announce, we don't have anything imminent. I think you were asking within the branded portfolio but ultimately you ask yourself things like, is it a strategic fit? Is it running on -- is it on auto pilot business that is doing no harm but contributing cash flow or is it a chronically key bucket and one that you just can't adjust by putting resources on. If we have those kinds of businesses clearly it makes more sense to put them under somebody else's ownership because they value it more than we will. Our whole theme today and what you heard around this new direction is focus and discipline segmentation. And that means saying yes to some things and saying no to other things as opposed to try to make everything happen across the entire portfolio. So it will be very logical and common sense should we pursue a divesture down the road that will also be very principle based in why we are doing it. ","Operator","And we will go again to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Sean, you had spoken very positively about frozen and I guess the scale and the opportunities for innovation. Can I conclude that this is an area where in portfolio segmentation you will want to invest and also I guess I'd like to ask there are bidders out there who will pay high multiples for those frozen assets? I mean is it -- would it have to be some kind of really high crazy amount to persuade ConAgra to part with it. Thanks.","Sean Connolly","Well, with respect to the first part of your question, Rob, it was breaking up a little bit but I think you were asking around -- is that an area we would be interested in investing in and I think the principle of disciplined segmentation applies within our frozen portfolio. There are clearly businesses that we will get behind and support and there are other businesses that we will manage for cash. And stable contribute-- we call them reliable contributors. So it depends. I think we will be very disciplined and very focused and judicious in terms of what we get behind there. With respect to your second -- the second part of your question, that's purely speculation. So I am not going to comment on it or fuel speculation other than to say I think you heard me say multiple times today, I am very open, my Board is very open to alternative ways of creating value should one come along that is clearly superior to our base plan and actionable and all of that. So there is nothing specific I can offer beyond that other than, that is overarching philosophy and yes it is simple but it is on wavering and we believe in it. ","Operator","And we will take a question now from Evan Morris from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Evan Morris ","Good morning, everyone. Yes, just Sean if you can remind just with regard to some of the cost savings and some of the levers that you talked about pulling on the SG&A side, the supply chain side. Can you just remind us how many these initiatives are similar initiatives? Did you employ at Hillshire, how much margin improvement did it derive and do you see sort of I guess in a relative sense more opportunity or less opportunity as you are assessing ConAgra and then I just have a follow up. ","Sean Connolly","I think Hillshire came from Sara Lee and I am not going to get into great details there other than to say big legacy food companies have SG&A opportunities. It's undeniable. And we got after at Hillshire, we are getting after it here, some of that work has happened as somebody pointed out few minutes ago in the past, but by no means does that mean our work is done. SG&A reduction is a never ending quest at ConAgra Foods. It will be cultural. It will be something that we have disdain for inefficiency because those are resources that could otherwise go into brand building, go into innovation or go to back to shareholders. And that is what we are going to drive against and there is additional opportunity beyond what we've already captured. ","Evan Morris ","Okay. And then just two quick follow ups. The book value of the Private Brands business right now, what is it?","John Gehring","I don't have that handy, off hand given the various pieces to it. Chris maybe follow up maybe but --","Evan Morris ","Okay. All right, we can follow up off line. And then just regard to the guidance for the first quarter being flat with last year, clearly below where street expectation were, is this just sort of the need for higher marketing, is it result of lower than expected sales, what's driving sort of the flat year-over-year guidance in the first quarter?","Sean Connolly","Well, I think I'll answer that by just taking us back to the big picture which is we've announced we are divesting Private Brands. We shared that the recovery on that business has been slower than we previously thought. We also shared that while we do expect that business to improve as we go through the course of the year. It will improve sequentially. So I think that kind of shapes really the answer your question.","Chris Klinefelter","Operator, this is Chris. Given where we are in terms of time, we have room for one more question. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Todd Duvak with Wells Fargo. ","Todd Duvak","Yes, good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess the question I have is regarding your financial policy. ConAgra's financial policy has been consistent for many years and targeting in investment grade credit rating and you have definitely reiterated that this morning which we appreciate. I guess one question Sean on Hillshire you had an agreement to acquire a peer company that was heavily debt financed and would have resulted in Hillshire's credit rating being downgraded to below investment grade. So my question is really twofold: first, does ConAgra's commitment to an investment grade rating derive from the Board or management or both? And secondly is it fair to assume that you see greater opportunities for operational improvement in your existing portfolio that reduce the appeal of a near-term transformational acquisition that could really jeopardize the company's IG rating. ","Sean Connolly","Well, let me take the second part first. The base plan we laid out today we have full conviction and its ability to make ConAgra a far better company into the future than in the past. So we believe in that base plan. We have conviction and of course we'll always remain open minded but that's our position on that. On investment grade, management and the Board of Directors are aligned, there is really nothing more to talk about on that, we are aligned and we are committed to it.","Operator","And that's concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for closing comments. ","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Just as a reminder this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. And as always we are available for discussions. Thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods. ","Operator","This concludes today's ConAgra Foods' fourth quarter earnings conference call.

My name is Jessica Morgan, and I will be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","We're pleased with the results of our fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, capping off a transformational and successful year for ConAgra Foods. For the fourth quarter, we posted EPS of $0.60 on a comparable basis, which is 18% growth. This brought our comparable EPS to $2.16 for the year, which is 17% growth and above the full year goal we shared with you previously.","Consumer Foods volume increased for the quarter as we expected. This is a significant improvement from volume trends seen earlier this year, which were impacted by past price increases. Operating profits for the Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments grew and the operating performance for the Ralcorp business came in as planned. All in all, a good performance.","We continue to make good progress on integrating the Ralcorp business and have established the operating structure for our new company. As part of the integration process, we have identified additional synergies and increased our fiscal 2017 synergy goal by a significant amount. And we've already repaid a significant amount of debt, which is a very, very good progress toward our fiscal 2015 debt reduction target. John and I will provide more detail on those accomplishments this morning and share our goals for fiscal year '14 and beyond. After that, we'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Tom McGough, recently appointed President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us.","Before we get started, Chris has a few remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our website.","Now, I'll turn it back -- the call back over to Gary. Thank you.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. As I indicated before, I'm pleased with our results for the fiscal fourth quarter and the full year and I'm very confident on our strong EPS outlook going forward. I'll speak to that after offering some remarks about our segment performance and John will discuss our outlook as well.","I'll start my segment remarks with Consumer Foods. Sales for the Consumer Foods segment were up 7%, driven by acquisitions and good organic volume performance. Many of our brands grew sales, shares and volumes. Along those lines, organic volumes increased 3%. This is an important turning point and a strong improvement from what we saw earlier this fiscal year. We've lapped last year's price increases and are benefiting from increased investment in our brands.","Let me offer a little context in terms of our recent brand investment. We're using point-of-difference communication, along with strong innovation, to increase consumer pull for our brands. Last quarter, we talked about our canned tomato portfolio, Hunt's and Ro*Tel, and that point-of-difference advertising that is really resonating with consumers and driving sales, volume and share gains and category growth. Similar messaging has been very effective for PAM and Reddi-wip as well. Emphasizing their usage occasions and promoting from new locations in the store are also driving more demand for a number of our brands. Effective marketing will be a key driver in the success of the innovations we're launching this summer. We're very excited about the new desserts, frozen breakfasts and other items you heard us talk about at CAGNY.","Take frozen breakfast, for example. This category has grown significantly over the past 5 years and frozen breakfast sandwiches have driven quite a bit of that growth, but frozen breakfast sandwiches are still an underdeveloped breakfast option. That's where Marie Callender's and Banquet come in. Building on capabilities we acquired when we bought Odom's Tennessee Pride and adding some strong culinary and cooking innovation, we've developed lines of breakfast sandwiches that break new grounds in terms of convenience and quality. We have significant innovation outside the frozen aisle as well. We're building on the terrific equity of Marie Callender's and introducing Marie Callender's Easy Sides, a shelf-stable pasta dish that cooks in about 4 minutes with no cleanup and delivers terrific flavors like Alfredo, Parmesan and Stroganoff. National TV support begins soon.","When we take into account our innovation, the brand investment we've made and the fact that we're turning the corner in terms of volume performance, we believe we're on a solid footing for a healthy top line performance from Consumer Foods in fiscal 2014.","Now on to operating profits. Consumer Foods comparable operating profit increased 3%. A combination of sales growth and margin management initiatives offset minimal inflation and put us in a good position to increase marketing and post profit growth. Overall, we're pleased with the underlying quality of this segment's profit performance this quarter.","In the Commercial Foods segment, sales were up 3% and operating profits were up 13%. Our flour milling operations posted strong profit growth with the combination of good volumes, improved mix and strong results from grain and byproduct merchandising.","In our Lamb Weston potato operations, growth in domestic markets was offset by short-term challenges in Asia, so our potato operations posted a modest profit decline for the quarter.","As we look to fiscal 2014, we plan to contribute our milling operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment, into a joint venture with Cargill and CHS called Ardent Mills, where we will have 44% ownership. This is a long-term strategic win in terms of innovation, customer service and efficiencies and, of course, profits. We expect this joint venture to be accretive to our EPS in a couple of years. John will say more about this.","I should point out that one of our major foodservice customers did not renew a sizable amount of potato business with us. Occasionally, contract negotiations turn out that way. We will be reallocating our capacity toward other customers and opportunities. In the meantime, there will be some margin impact at Lamb Weston during this transition, but we're confident that over the long term, we'll make up for this loss and continue the strong growth we've seen from the frozen potato business.","So the combination of these issues related to the Commercial Foods segment, meaning the Ardent Mills dilution and the Lamb Weston customer issue, is the reason for the $0.10 or so of headwinds that we mentioned in our fiscal 2014 guidance. We continue to have a lot of confidence in our Commercial Food operations going forward. We're coming off 16% profit growth in fiscal 2013 for the segment with plenty of good years leading up to that, demonstrating the benefit of our strong innovation, international expansion that includes dynamic emerging market potential and product mix improvement. Our expansion into new products and new market segments with sweet potatoes, proprietary grain blends and growth in high-potential markets outside the U.S. demonstrate our strong operating capabilities and good customer relationships. We have high expectations for the contribution from Commercial Foods over the long term.","Moving on to the Ralcorp operations, for the quarter, profit was in line with our expectations. We are in the early innings of integration and we now have more clarity on cost synergies. And this has allowed us to raise our annual synergy projections to $300 million by fiscal 2017, up from our original estimates of $225 million. Those cost savings will come mainly from the areas we expected such as procurement, where we are already gaining some synergies from ingredient buying, as well as logistics, plant efficiencies and SG&A savings.","Ralcorp sales trends have been softer during this transition than we expect to see in the future. Ralcorp's own restructuring efforts, which began several months prior to our ownership, cut the organization too deeply, particularly on the sales front. We began to take corrective action as we integrate the Ralcorp business into ConAgra Foods. Additionally, some upside-down commodity positions drove pricing actions that put certain categories beyond the appropriate price gap architecture and we're in the process of addressing this as well. These issues are short term and definitely fixable. We're confident that we can move forward quickly with new operating capabilities and our broader integration work while generating the EPS contribution we expected from Ralcorp in fiscal 2014.","When we look to the longer term, we're very excited about the growth potential of bringing real scale and our CPG capabilities to the private brand space. The potential in the private brands business is substantial, rooted in our customers' demand for differentiated and progressive retail brands. Our vision is to transition the private brands business model from transactional to strategic partnerships. And in our recent top-to-top meetings with almost all our major customers, I can personally attest they have a very strong appreciation for the functional expertise, scale and growth opportunities that we bring to the table with our portfolio. We're excited and continue to be highly confident that this multiyear journey will be well worth the effort. And the early work that we've done, as well as our very positive conversations with customers, have confirmed the big opportunity ahead of us.","As part of integrating Ralcorp and building the right organizational structure during the first half of fiscal 2014, we will be moving to 3 financial reporting segments. We'll continue to have our Consumer Foods segment and we'll have 2 new segments: one called Private Brands and another called Foodservice.","Within Consumer Foods, many of you saw the announcement in early May regarding Tom McGough, who took over as President of Consumer Foods late in our fourth quarter. I was really pleased with our succession planning and the seamless way Tom has been able to take over leadership of this segment. Tom was leading our grocery business right before this and he has a strong track record of accomplishments in the Consumer Foods space. Paul Maass, who you know from his leadership of our commercial operations, will oversee both the Private Brands and Foodservice segments. Paul is extremely knowledgeable of marketplace dynamics, has a passion for building great partnerships with customers and has earned the reputation as a very strong and engaging leader who produces outstanding results.","The Private Brands segment will include much of the former Ralcorp business, along with the existing private brands business from ConAgra Foods. The Foodservice segment will include Lamb Weston, along with the foodservice operations that previously were included in our Consumer Foods segment and those that were part of Ralcorp operations, as well as specialty businesses such as Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and J.M. Swank. To repeat a point made earlier, we're assuming that our milling operations will be contributed to Ardent Mills at some point during the fiscal year, so that's why I'm not mentioning it as part of the long-term plans for this segment.","Mike Locascio has joined Paul's team to run the Private Brands business. Mike is a veteran in the CPG space, having led many of our Consumer Foods brands and of late, he led our customer development organization. He built that organization from the ground up and established a team with the pricing capabilities and rigor that we've been able to apply within our Consumer Foods portfolio over the past 18 months. Paul and Mike bring excellent credentials and skill sets like risk management, deep commodity market understanding and pricing architecture to our new Private Brands organization.","Across all of our segments, we expect to have a strong team that includes many talented key players from Ralcorp, as well as from within the ConAgra Foods organizations, including those with deep private brand experience. We still have work to do to begin financial reporting under this organizational structure, so this will not come to life in terms of how you see our results until we're well underway in fiscal 2014. But it's a big step to get the right leaders named and the structure started, so we wanted to share this recent news with you now.","All-in-all, we're pleased with the very strong year we just finished. We have made major transformational changes to the business and are off to a good start on integrating Ralcorp. In our base businesses, we grew segment profits while investing significantly in our brands and reached our goal of returning Consumer Foods to positive volume trends in Q4.","As I mentioned earlier, I've been spending quite a bit of time with customers over the past few months. These conversations are really encouraging because it's clear that customers understand the advantages that ConAgra Foods can bring to them. Our unique blend of branded, private brand and foodservice businesses allow us to compete at a different scale and as a truly strategic partner who can help customers grow. These are great dialogues that reinforce and confirm our long-term opportunities and we're really excited about our differentiation in the market and the partnerships we're building.","Wrapping up, as we take into account the growth potential in core operations and synergies we expect from Ralcorp, we expect double-digit EPS growth in fiscal 2014 and to grow EPS by at least 10% per year from fiscal 2015 to 2017. That should allow us to exceed $3 per share in fiscal 2017, a major milestone. And at that point, we expect to have posted 5 consecutive years of double-digit comparable EPS growth. After that, we expect to continue delivering strong financial performance with the increased sales and EPS targets I outlined earlier.","John will go more in depth about projections and other financial details and I'll close my remarks today by saying this is a great time to be at ConAgra Foods. The pieces are in place and our team is very excited about accelerating growth. Thank you for your interest in our company. And now I'll turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on 4 topics this morning. First, I'll discuss some fiscal fourth quarter and full year performance highlights; next, I'll address comparability matters; then on to cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, including some details related to our recent acquisition activity; and finally, I will provide some comments on our outlook for fiscal 2014 and our updated long-term algorithm.","Let's start with some performance highlights. Overall, the fourth quarter and full year results were in line with our expectations and reflect a strong performance in fiscal 2013.","On the full year, let me provide a few highlights. First, for fiscal 2013, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.85 versus $1.12 last year. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.16 versus $1.84 in the prior fiscal year, a 17% increase.","Our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments both posted strong year-over-year performance. And our Consumer Foods segment significantly increased marketing investments to support our brands and innovation. And over our 4 months of ownership, Ralcorp operating segments delivered approximately $132 million of operating profit on a comparable basis. When we take into account the additional corporate expense of approximately $13 million relating to Ralcorp, the results were in line with our expectations.","Turning to our fourth quarter results. For the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported net sales of $4.6 billion, up 34%, driven by the addition of Ralcorp, improved volumes and acquisitions in our Consumer Foods segment and pricing and mix improvements in our Commercial Foods segment. The impact of higher year-over-year wheat prices in our flour milling operations also contributed to sales growth this quarter.","For the quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.45 versus a loss of $0.21 per share in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.60 versus $0.51 in the prior-year quarter, an 18% increase.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few key highlights, starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $2.3 billion, up about 7% from the year-ago period. This reflects about 5 points of growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales were up 2%. In this quarter, base volumes increased about 3%, which represents a significant sequential improvement over the third quarter. Price mix was negative, about 1%.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $295 million or up about 3% from the year-ago period. The operating profit improvement reflects the benefit from acquisitions and our margin management initiatives, partially offset by an increase in marketing costs and incentive compensation. The impact from foreign exchange this quarter on both net sales and operating profit for the segment was immaterial.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $65 million in the quarter. For the fiscal fourth quarter, we experienced inflation of about 1%, a bit better than our expectations.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $85 million, up about 15% from the prior year quarter, including a 5% increase in marketing investments in our base business.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion or up about 4%, reflecting price mix improvements across the segment. The passthrough of higher wheat costs in our milling operations had a positive $29 million impact on net sales for this fiscal quarter. The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit increased 13% from the year-ago period to $156 million. The strong year-over-year performance reflects improvement in our milling operations, offsetting a modest decline at Lamb Weston.","Moving on to corporate expenses for the quarter. Corporate expenses were $124 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $87 million versus $64 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects higher incentive compensation costs and the addition of Ralcorp corporate expense. Our effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 34%, consistent with our planned rate.","Our recently acquired Ralcorp business delivered net sales for the quarter of $962 million. And operating profit, excluding the impact of comparability items, was approximately $110 million, about what we've projected.","As noted previously, during the initial integration phase and until we fully implement organization changes related to the Ralcorp acquisition, we will continue to report the results of Ralcorp's operations in 2 segments: the Ralcorp Food Group segment and the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery segment. As Gary noted, we are currently in the process of building out our new reporting structure and we expect to transition to the new structure during the first half of fiscal 2014. After that transition, we expect to report our operating results in 3 operating segments: Consumer Foods, Private Brands and Foodservice.","Overall, we're excited about the opportunities that this acquisition provides us for long-term growth and attractive accretion over the next several years that we expect to be driven in part by strong synergies.","Now I'll move to my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.15 per diluted share of net expense in this quarter's reported EPS related to several items. The most significant comparability item this quarter relates to acquisition matters, including transaction costs, acquisition-related restructuring, integration costs, principally related to our recent acquisition of Ralcorp. In all, we recorded approximately $67 million or $0.10 per share of net expense related to these acquisition matters. We also incurred about $5 million or $0.01 per share of incremental tax expense related to the adverse impact of transaction costs on our income tax rate this quarter.","Next, on hedging, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the net hedging expense included in corporate expenses was approximately $37 million or $0.05 per share. In addition, we recorded approximately $6 million or $0.01 per share of expense related to the actuarial or mark-to-market losses in connection with the pension accounting method we adopted last year and about $6 million or $0.01 per share of expense related to the early retirement of debt.","And finally, in the fiscal fourth quarter, we recognized a net benefit related to legal matters of $22 million or approximately $0.03 per share primarily related to a favorable legal settlement.","Next, I'll cover my third topic: cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $184 million of cash on hand and $185 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We continue to emphasize cash flow within our business and for fiscal year 2013, we delivered operating cash flows of approximately $1.4 billion, a bit better than our expectations.","On working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives and maintain our focus on cash conversion cycle metrics. For fiscal year 2013, working capital changes contributed modestly to operating cash flows.","On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $169 million versus $98 million in the prior year period. And for the full fiscal year, our CapEx was approximately $458 million, including CapEx for our expansion at our Lamb Weston facility in Boardman, Oregon, and about $46 million of CapEx related to the recently acquired Ralcorp business.","Net interest expense was $102 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $51 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily driven by the additional interest expense related to the Ralcorp acquisition. Dividends for the quarter increased from $100 million in the year-ago quarter to $104 million.","On capital allocation, as we have previously noted, our capital allocation priority through fiscal year 2015 will be the repayment of debt. As I noted last quarter, we expect to use the proceeds from the planned Ardent Mills transaction to accelerate and increase the targeted level of debt repayment through fiscal 2015. This quarter, we paid off $566 million of certain Ralcorp private placement debt to complete our financing plans. We consider that part of the overall financing process we executed in connection with the Ralcorp acquisition as opposed to debt reduction. In terms of the debt reduction goals we've established, we have repaid over $400 million of debt this quarter. Therefore, we are off to a very good start on our deleveraging plans and on improving our leverage ratios.","As previously noted, we expect to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we delever and we expect to significantly reduce our share repurchases during this time as well. And while we expect limited acquisition activity in the near term as we repay debt, we will continue to prudently support the right investments for our business, including investments to support innovation, production capacity and our cost savings initiatives.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2014 outlook and our long-term algorithm. First, on our fiscal 2014 outlook, we currently expect fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be approximately $2.40. This represents growth of about 11% over our fiscal 2013 base. This also includes the impact of about $0.10 of headwinds in our Commercial Foods segment.","And here are a few 2014 highlights. In our Consumer Foods segment, we expect low-single-digit organic volume growth and mid-single-digit operating profit growth. This fiscal 2014 estimate also reflects modest gross margin improvement in our Consumer Foods segment, driven by mix improvements and strong cost savings, partially offset by modest inflation. For fiscal 2014, we expect cost savings of about $230 million in our Consumer Foods business. And we expect a modest increase in our advertising and promotion costs to support our consumer brands and new product introductions.","As a reminder, fiscal 2013 was a period of significant reinvestment, supported by our margin expansion. So that while we expect the increase in fiscal 2014 to be more modest, our marketing spend in 2014 will reflect continued support of our brands.","In our Commercial Foods segment, we expect a decrease in our operating profit, driven by 2 factors. First, assuming a midyear close of the Ardent Mills transaction, we expect about $0.03 per diluted share of negative impact to fiscal 2014 earnings. While we expect the Ardent Mills transaction to be accretive by year 3, financing costs and transaction amortization are expected to exceed the benefit of synergies in the first couple of years. Also, the expected use of proceeds to repay low-interest rate debt impacts accretion in the early years.","As a reminder, after the close of the transaction, the earnings from this venture will be reported as equity earnings. And ConAgra Mills will not be treated as discontinued operations given the accounting rules, so there will be a year-over-year decline in reported segment sales and operating profit for a year after the transaction closes.","The second factor impacting our 2014 Commercial Foods operating profit relates to our Lamb Weston business, where we expect about $0.06 to $0.07 per share of headwinds related to the loss of business with a significant foodservice customer. And while we are already shifting that capacity to other customers, we do expect there to be a negative volume and margin impact in fiscal 2014. We do, however, remain very confident in the long-term top and bottom line prospects for this business.","Now I'd like to highlight a few matters related to our Ralcorp acquisition and integration. First, we continue to expect approximately $0.25 of total EPS benefit in fiscal 2014, in line with our prior estimates. As Gary noted, the integration is proceeding essentially as expected. As he also noted, some of the restructuring efforts that were began at Ralcorp prior to our acquisition have weighed on recent sales profit performance. We are therefore moving quickly to implement organization changes which we believe will better position the business to strengthen sales performance and to leverage the combined capabilities of the larger enterprise.","As we look ahead to fiscal 2014, we expect sales related to the Ralcorp business to be approximately $4.2 billion as we implement organizational changes and leverage our sales and pricing capabilities to reverse recent soft top line performance in the business. We expect Ralcorp sales to resume organic growth in fiscal 2015.","On synergies, based on our integration work to date, we now expect cost synergies resulting from the Ralcorp acquisition to reach $300 million of annual pretax benefit by fiscal 2017, an increase from our prior estimate of $225 million. Further, while we have a significant systems integration workload ahead of us, we are very confident in our systems integration capabilities. In fact, we continue to be recognized as an industry leader regarding our partnerships with world-class technology providers such as SAP and for our strong SAP capabilities. We were the first company in the Western Hemisphere to be recognized by SAP as an Advanced Center of Excellence in 2009 and have since been recertified. And over the past year, we have been able to seamlessly integrate the Odom's Tennessee Pride, National Pretzel, Del Monte Canada, Kangaroo, Bertolli and P.F. Chang's businesses onto our SAP platform. We are very well positioned to take on the task of extending our technology platforms to the Ralcorp businesses to drive further improvements and cost savings in the way we buy, make, sell and deliver our products.","For fiscal 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 34% for the full year, although this rate may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter.","I would also like to note that while we expect strong EPS growth for the full fiscal year, we currently expect our 2014 fiscal first quarter EPS to be about flat with the first quarter of 2013. This is due primarily to 2 factors. First, in our Consumer Foods segment, we are in the process of launching a significant number of new products into the market and we, therefore, have a significant year-over-year increase in slotting and marketing investments in our first -- fiscal first quarter. In addition, the operating profit impact of transitioning customer business within the Lamb Weston operations will be most pronounced in the first half of the fiscal year. The remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2014 are expected to reflect strong EPS growth.","Turning to cash flow. We expect continued strength in our operating cash flows. And in fiscal 2014, we expect cash flows from operating activities to be in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, including a modest contribution from working capital improvement. Further, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million for 2014. Consistent with our stated capital allocation priorities, we currently expect to repay approximately $700 million of debt in fiscal 2014 and a total of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2015. These amounts exclude any additional repayment we expect to fund from the cash distributions related to the Ardent Mills transaction.","With regard to restructuring charges related to Ralcorp, we do expect to undertake some restructuring actions as part of integrating the business. While we are not yet in a position to give financial details on the plans as they are still being developed, I would note that these charges, which should span a 2- or 3-year period, are not expected to materially impact our plans to repay debt or reinvest in the business. We expect that a significant portion of these charges will be noncash and that the cash requirements, when identified, will be manageable given our strong cash flow.","Now I'd like to update you on our longer-term outlook and algorithm. First, for fiscal years 2015 to 2017, we expect comparable diluted EPS to grow at least 10% annually. This is expected to result in comparable EPS in excess of $3 per share by fiscal 2017 and 5 consecutive years of double-digit growth. After the fiscal 2015 and 2017 period, when the majority of the cost synergies from the Ralcorp transaction are realized, we expect long-term EPS growth of 7% to 9% on a comparable basis. We also expect long-term annual sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%. The long-term EPS and sales expectations represent increases from our prior targets and reflect the benefit of ongoing innovation, marketing and margin enhancement initiatives, as well as the anticipated benefit from greater participation in the attractive Private Brands segment.","In summary, fiscal 2013 has been an exciting year for ConAgra Foods. We have delivered strong performance and have set in motion transformational changes that have positioned the company for very strong performance in the years ahead.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 questions for me. First one would be on the Ralcorp synergies. You've raised those to $300 million through 2017. If some of that is expected to fall in '14, I guess why is the net accretion for the year still $0.25? I guess either the Ralcorp base EBIT is expected to be a bit lower than you thought or maybe you're just being so much conservative. So I guess, in other words, do you still expect the $400 million in Ralcorp EBIT that you discussed at CAGNY?","John F. Gehring","Yes. Andrew, this is John. Let me try to take those pieces. First of all, I think on the synergies, I do think the large portion of the additional synergies are going to take time, so I'd say we're probably going to get a little bit more benefit in FY '14. I would say related to our expectations about the base EBIT for Ralcorp, I'd say those are still in line with what we've talked about earlier, approximately $400 million. And then is there some conservatism in there? I think the straightforward answer is, yes, there probably is a little bit of a contingency in our plans. I think everybody can appreciate that we're just starting out the first full year of ownership. We're in the process of changing the organization. So I think it's only prudent that we plan for some disruption as we move the organization around.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then, Gary, you mentioned a lot of the top-to-top conversations that you've been having with key retail customers. I guess there's been some chatter out there that maybe certain customers are more concerned with having a company like yourself with scale now across branded and private label and looking to thwart that in some way or separating the way you come to customers. And I guess it sounded like you've had some, frankly, much more encouraging conversations than a lot of key customers. So maybe could you just put some of that in perspective to see if what I'm talking about is even something that you've been hearing?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, happy to, Andrew. What you mentioned about fear of -- or concern about scale, we've heard it a couple of times, but it's very scattered. I wouldn't say that it's prevalent. And the way that we've addressed that is really talking about you're able to, as a customer, really leverage a lot of the smaller suppliers to do a lot of kind of special projects that bigger guys might not see as being very efficient in their supply chain. And what we've talked about is let's think very holistically, that we're willing to do some of those one-offs because the pot in terms of the total business opportunities are so much greater. That is -- that works extremely well virtually every time that we have that discussion. I'd say what we feel best about coming out of those discussions is the understanding that it's going to take a little time but that we are going to get the sales structure in a much better place. Our vision is to have one ConAgra point person at the head of each customer and then the organization splits underneath that. So knowing that there's going to be one ConAgra with dedicated resources to the branded side and dedicated resources to the private brand side and more resources than we have today on the private branded side is very welcome. And the second is they are extremely excited about our innovation capabilities that we've demonstrated on the consumer side of the business that they have seen. And they are very excited about the opportunity to leverage that on the private brand side. And in fact, we have some of those big customers coming to Omaha, already scheduled, just to work through that.","Operator","And we'll move now to David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First thing I'd just like to say is after, I think, 10 quarters of negative volumes in Consumer Foods, it feels great to see a plus 3% on that figure. So congratulations on that. Nice job in establishing some momentum there. My questions are going to go to Ralcorp. The first one, and I think maybe most important, is the $300 million of synergies, if I do my math right, guys, that would suggest something like $0.46 a share benefit over the course of the period, which I think goes through 2017. Said differently, it looks to me like it's about a contribution of 5 percentage points to EPS each and every year if I just kind of allocated it equally. And maybe the question that I'd like you to respond to is if your guidance in '15, '16 and '17 is for about 10% growth, it sounds to me like you get half of it simply from the realization of the synergies. And that would mean that the other half, just 5 points of it, comes from all of the rest of your operations. So the first question is, do I have the math right? And the second question is, it seems like that the component of the organic growth is really achievable, maybe I would use the word conservative.","Chris Klinefelter","David, this is Chris. So the thing that I would offer on that is I think your general logic is right. We're assuming mid-single-digit performance in the base business and the aggregate contribution of the synergies is largely what you're saying. The other thing to mention about the reason that we're signing up for a mid-single-digit performance in base business is, as you've heard us talk about our capital allocation priority during -- particularly during the early years of owning Ralcorp, it's toward debt reduction. So in our prior EPS long-term goal of kind of 6% to 8%, we did have a point or 2 from allocating capital that we don't have. So with that, yes, the rest of your math works.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. And David, what I would say is having been in this industry forever, being able to -- starting with the year that we just finished, being able to commit to 5 straight years of double-digit EPS growth while still staying committed to strong dividend is pretty compelling. So we plan with the appropriate level of risk management and I think we're quite pleased where we are.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, makes sense. If I could just ask one more question on RH. So the sales in the quarter would annualize out at something like $3.85 billion. You gave guidance just a moment ago in the script of, I think, $4.2 billion in sales for F '14. Can you talk a little bit about how quickly this changes, like what we should be expecting within this number to see such a -- I mean, I think that's a quality improvement right there over the current run rate, but how fast does it take before we start to see those actions show up in results?","John F. Gehring","Yes. So David, this is John. A couple of things to keep in mind. There is a fair amount of seasonality in this business. So I think to take any 3-month period and multiply it by 4 probably doesn't land you necessarily in the right place. A lot of seasonality, in particular in the fall and -- particularly in the fall, where you have strength. So the other thing I'd say is there have been some areas -- there are some softness in some of the categories. There's also some business that we've walked away from -- or collectively, we've walked away from around some co-packing things that were in the base, which accounts for some of the softness right now. I would expect, in terms of the impact that our changes are going to have on reversing some of the trends, I think that's going to be more in the back half of our fiscal year. It's going to take us time to -- not that we're not working on things right now, but I think to really fully deploy our capabilities, to fully align our sales teams against this business and really start to have an impact with customers is probably going to be late in the fiscal year, second half.","Operator","And Bryan Spillane with Bank of America has our next question.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to get a little more color on Commercial Foods and the potato business, the frozen potato business. Can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the factors that led to this customer switching vendors? Is there more capacity in the industry? Is it getting more competitive bidding for contracts? And also, if I'm understanding it right, some of the customers of this customer who switched vendors may not be entirely happy with the switch. So if you could just talk a little bit about how that occurred and if there's been any other change in the industry?","Paul T. Maass","Bryan, this is Paul, and I appreciate the question. The perspective I'd share first is if you think about RFPs or request for proposals contracting, it's kind of the nature of the business in Commercial Foods, so it's something that we normally navigate through. We do have a track record of working our way through that in a successful way. What makes this one unique is this is a customer we partnered with for a long time and have built business towards pretty large business. So it's a big change and that makes it a little bit unique. And as we work through it, because of the long-term relationship that we have had, there's a lot of complexity and transition in it. And frankly, there's some costs involved with that. We are underway as far as transitioning to other customers. And I would describe it as the silver lining in a change like this is it enables our Lamb Weston business to truly strategically partner with some new and other customers. And we feel really good about the outlook after we get through the short-term transition.","Operator","And JPMorgan's Ken Goldman has our next question.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your Consumer Foods volume came in much better than what Nielsen data would have suggested. And I realize lower pricing was the impetus for your actual performance improvement. I suppose I'm just interested in the difference between that actual performance and what was measured. Was there maybe a bit of a sell-in of new products that happened over the summer? Did non-measured channels just perform that much better? Maybe some color on that would be helpful.","Thomas M. McGough","Sure, Ken. This is Tom McGough. As we look at our Q4 results, there's a couple of things that highlight. One, we did demonstrate very strong sequential improvement in the fourth quarter as a result of lapping comparable pricing but also as a result of increasing our marketing investments. We've improved our margins throughout the year and we're seeing very positive share impact from our marketing investments, particularly in frozen, our shelf-stable and refrigerated portfolio. As you highlighted, we continue to see non-measured channels grow at a much faster rate than the measured channels. And as we enter the summer season, we have secured some very strong seasonal merchandising programs that have put us in a position for good volume performance. So overall, we're very pleased with the quality of our organic volume growth.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. And I would just add that we are staying disciplined on our pricing architecture. We're certainly going to be competitive, but we're staying disciplined there.","Operator","And we'll move now to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My question's mainly on Ralcorp. So if I -- if David's math was correct, as I think you agreed to, implies something like 20% growth over the next 3 years starting in '14 in the Ralcorp EBIT. And that's not something that any private label company that's publicly traded has ever been able to achieve. So I just want to play devil's advocate here and understand why a private label business in a volatile commodity environment would be able to grow its earnings at those -- at that rate. And I think your guidance also implies stronger sales growth than the company's -- than Ralcorp is currently producing and has produced historically. So you're cost-cutting and you're going to see an acceleration in sales growth and, at the end of the day, you're going to produce 20% or so growth in EBITDA. I understand that some of that is related to an easy comp because they're coming from some depressed earnings. Could you just conceptually help me understand what the step change here is going to be? And so what's the risk that you're not able to achieve these targets on the Ralcorp side?","John F. Gehring","Yes. Akshay, this is John. Let me start with that, then I might turn it over to others for some comments. But I think as others have highlighted the math, the earnings growth is driven an awful lot by the synergies. That's what's driving the math. We feel very confident about the source of those synergies. And just to reiterate things we've talked about earlier, most of those synergies are going to come from our supply chain. We have good line of sight in terms of the opportunities, in terms of procurement and as well as opportunities we think we have around rationalizing manufacturing and logistics networks. Those latter 2 tend to take more time. The other thing I would just point out mechanically is those synergies apply to the whole enterprise, not just to the Ralcorp business. So as those synergies are realized, what you'll actually see is some additional tailwinds apply to some of the other businesses. The other thing that I think we feel very good about is the fact that we see an opportunity in the marketplace. We see good tailwinds that we believe in, in terms of the long-term tailwinds from -- and trends in private label. We think we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. And when we look at the kinds of customer relationships we have, combined with the customer relationships that the Ralcorp team brings, we do think there is a 1 plus 1 equals 3. And maybe I'll have Gary comment a little bit more on the customer side.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. You heard me talk earlier about those customer meetings. I'll tell you 2 reasons why we believe that we can impact the top line on Ralcorp. And we're not shooting for the moon here, but we do expect that we can drive better top line growth starting later this year. And those 2 reasons are: one, as we mentioned, Ralcorp's own restructuring efforts that started maybe 6 months or so before the acquisition frankly cut the organization too deeply, particularly on the sales front; and number two, as we've said before, Ralcorp got upside-down on a few key commodities and priced beyond the appropriate price gaps in some categories at some customers. So we are very diligently working on both issues. Obviously, it takes some time to get it right and to work through the system, including getting the pricing all the way to the shelf, but it's very much in process. So we're in this for the long haul and we're going to do it right. And that's why we have so much confidence in those numbers.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Unknown Analyst","This is Scott Barber [ph] filling in for Thilo. Unfortunately, all my questions have been asked and answered, so I have no further questions at this time.","Operator","And we'll move now to Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe I missed this, but can you give us some color on what you're expecting for inflation in both Ralcorp and Consumer Foods for next year?","John F. Gehring","Yes. I think across our whole portfolio, Jason, we're looking at low single digits. I'd call that probably in the 2% to 3% range right now as we enter the year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You mentioned being upside-down in some contracts for Ralcorp this past year. Should we expect any of that to reverse? It sounds like low single digits would be, no, not really, it's not like you've got a windfall coming there.","John F. Gehring","Yes. I don't know that -- I wouldn't view it as a windfall. I think we've got the problem out of the way. And this is on some of the limit areas where they had some issues. And as we look at a very, very large buy across the whole enterprise, I'm not sure any benefits there would be significant.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. I think the benefit there is we will be able to reverse some of the price gap issues that we've had. And again, that takes time to work through the system, Jason, as you know, but I think that's where the real benefit comes from. That top line, it'll take a bit of time, but we'll see a better performance there because of that.","Operator","And we'll move now to Deutsche Bank's Eric Katzman.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I have 2 questions. First, on the Lamb Weston business, how quickly can you change that? What accounts are available to you? I assume you have to take it from somebody else who supply in the frozen french fries, so why are you going to get that? And then on the Ralcorp business, I understand your comfort level, I guess, at some point in raising sales guidance beyond fiscal '18 to 3% to 4%, which implies an acceleration in that business. But with the weakness this year, I mean, what should we look forward from that, I guess, new kind of Private Labels segment or the Ralcorp business between now and fiscal '17, top line?","Paul T. Maass","I'll go and hit on the -- this is Paul -- on the Lamb Weston question. And the transition, it will be relatively short. The capacity kind of in the industry is one that I'd describe as relatively capacity-constrained, so it's relatively tight. So it's fair to describe it as more of a 0 sum game. It doesn't exactly work out one month to the next, but when you think about it over the course of the year, I believe the transition will work its way through in that type of a time frame.","John F. Gehring","Yes. And Eric, on the Ralcorp question, this is John, I'll take that. Kind of consistent with my comments earlier, I think '14, we're going to work to stabilize the business and I think we'll start to see some improvement in the back half of FY '14. As I commented earlier, I think 2015 will be a year where we start to see some organic growth in that Ralcorp business. And then from there out to 2018, I would just expect us to see a gradual improvement as we'll then start to approach that higher growth rate over time. So kind of stabilized improvement in '15 and gradual or sequential improvement after that.","Operator","And we'll hear a question now from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I come back to Ralcorp and cereals? Other companies are saying that adult cereals are quite weak right now and private label trends look weak in the measured channels. I think you mentioned price gaps being a factor there, but what gives you the confidence that those trends can be reversed and reinvigorated?","John F. Gehring","Sure. Alexia, you're right about the price gaps. That's one of the places where it's the most egregious and we will get those price gaps back to the appropriate levels. We also have a pretty significant amount of innovation coming in that space and we think we can do even more there with our innovation capabilities. And then probably, most importantly, while cereal is certainly an important category for us, we have a very, very broad portfolio. So there may be some more challenges in some categories than others, more opportunities in some than others, so I wouldn't really speak to the macro in cereal from our perspective. I'd probably leave that best to the bigger branded players.","Operator","And we have a question now from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Clay Crumbliss","This is Clay Crumbliss on for Rob. I know you guys said that you're not in a position to provide financial details on the Ralcorp integration, but I wanted to see if you could maybe provide us with a time line that you'd be able to give us that clarity. And then two, maybe even if you could just give us a directional number, that would be helpful. Even though we'll strip those out, it would be good to get a sense for how onerous the integration will be to know if we're talking in the $50 million range or $500 million.","John F. Gehring","Yes. And I think -- this is John -- I'm going to address it from a restructuring standpoint. Is that the restructuring, what you're referring to?","Clay Crumbliss","Yes, that's right.","John F. Gehring","Yes. I'm not going to provide a lot of details here. I think from a timeline standpoint, I think some of the early activities you're expecting in integration and some of the early costs, I think, are already underway. And we talked about those in some of our comparability items the last couple of quarters, things related to severance, et cetera. And I think some of those will go on for a few more quarters. I think the things that are a little harder to quantify right now will be things related really to changing our manufacturing network, optimizing our logistics networks. I think as you can appreciate, those questions tend to be fairly complex. We do a lot of modeling and a lot of complex planning on that. So I don't have specific numbers, but as I said in my comments, we're confident that the cash requirements for those are not going to cause any significant change in our capital allocation plans or debt repayment plans.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney, ConAgra's Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Brian Kearney","Good morning, everyone. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. While we are making those statements in good faith and we are confident about the company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, we refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today. References to adjusted items including organic net sales refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability. Please see the press release for additional information on our comparability items.","As a reminder, starting in fiscal 2018, we introduced the metric of organic net sales, which excludes the impact of FX, divestitures, and acquisition until the anniversary date of the transaction. The reconciliations of those adjusted measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either of the earnings press release or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found on our Web site at ConAgrabrands.com\/investor-relations.","Now, I'll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone, happy holidays. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call. We delivered strong results in Q2 and remain squarely on track with our transformation plan. Strategically our top priority this year is strengthening top line performance behind modernized brands and a strong innovation slate. Two quarters in, we like what we see, our top line return to organic growth in the second quarter, ahead of schedule.","After a fast start to the year, we were in a position to add incremental support behind our brands in Q2 to enhance distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial. Most of these investments were above the net sales line and consistent with our strategy to reacquaint our consumer base with our modernized brands. However, we again experienced elevated inflation, including increased costs as a result of the recent hurricanes. The net result in Q2 was that, despite pricing ahead of our categories, gross margins were pressured by the convergence of higher startup costs to support our brands and elevated inflation. Importantly, we remain confident in our long-term margin expansion opportunity and our ability to deliver on the 2020 outlook we provided at our investor day last year.","We continue to be active with our M&A agenda to bolster our strong positions in the important Snacks and Frozen categories. During the quarter, we completed our $250 million acquisition of Angie's Artisan Treats, the maker of Angie's Boom Chicka Pop, the fastest growing national read-to-eat popcorn brand in the U.S., and as you saw earlier today, we announced an agreement to acquire Sandwich Bros., which I will elaborate on in a few minutes.","We also continue to deliver on our target to repurchase $1.1 billion of shares during fiscal 2018. We repurchased approximately $280 million of common stock during the second quarter. The bottom line is we're encouraged about our year-to-date performance, and we're updating our 2018 guidance to reflect organic net sales and adjusted EPS to be near the high end of their respective guidance ranges.","During the quarter, we marked our one-year anniversary as a branded pure play CPG company. And compared to where we were just three years ago the transformation has been quite remarkable. Between exiting private brands, successfully spinning off Lamb Weston as a thriving public company, and remaking our core business and culture into a more energized competitive unit, we have been and we will continue to be relentlessly focused on value creation. It's been heavy lifting unwinding decades of engrained behaviors, but we like where we are, and we're confident in our future.","Most of you are familiar with the expected cadence of our transformation plan shown on slide seven. I'm happy to say that we remain squarely on track with these expectations. Fiscal 2016 and 2017 were indeed a heavy lift as we put in the work to thoughtfully and methodically upgrade our revenue base and reset the top line by cutting back on excessive deep discount promotions and rationalizing a long tail of low-performing skews. We also focused on improving efficiencies to build a strong foundation on the bottom line and expand margins. But as we've said all along, we can't cut our way to prosperity; we must grow the top line. And we will do it the right way, by investing in renovation and innovation to achieve sustainable growth over the long-term.","As we entered fiscal 2018 we were working from a much stronger revenue base. We have a healthier, less promotional business in U.S. retail. And our focus is now on improving brand saliency, which means reacquainting consumers with our modernized brands, and making them top-of-mind again. Accordingly, we're making investments in innovation and renovation to enhance distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial to drive top line growth. And top line growth is exactly what we've achieved.","On slide eight, you can see organic net sales grew 2.3% in the quarter. Strong volume performance particularly in our U.S. retail businesses drove this result. Further, we estimate that even after adjusting for the positive impact of the recent hurricanes we delivered slight organic net sales growth in the second quarter. We estimate an approximately 220 basis point benefit related to hurricanes during the quarter.","Our Food Service segment saw a one-time benefit from the hurricanes, and our Grocery and Snacks segment benefited from some customer warehouse and consumer pantry stocking. But the underlying strength of our core business is an encouraging affirmation of our plan and aggressive actions to jumpstart the top line. Make no mistake, we have much more to do, but we're making great progress in bending the sales trend and we're doing it the right way.","The data on slide nine speaks to the quality of our growth. Our distribution performance shown here as TPDs, or total points of distribution is continuing to improve, we expect this trend to move upward in the back half supported by net gains as the pruning of low-performing skews abates and innovation continues to roll out.","Importantly, we have continued to increase sales velocity as we upgraded the quality of our TPDs. When we modernize our product and discontinue to weak skews we recondition consumers to purchase updated products off the shelf at full margin and the velocities are getting better every time we look at the data. As our base sales velocities improve our dollar sales have followed, turning positive in the second quarter.","As you can see on slide 10, these trends have allowed us to continue to price above our categories on average. We have also remained true to our value-over-volume strategy as the present sold on promotion has decreased every quarter for more than two years. While that trend is not sustainable in perpetuity, this clearly indicates that our strong volume performance was not driven by deep discounts or price rollbacks. We remain squarely focused on improving our base sales and reducing our reliance on inefficient trade promotion.","Turning to slide 11, we remain on track to deliver against our 2020 margin goals. In the early innings of our transformation plan we got a fast start on margin improvement as we began to implement our value-over-volume strategy. But as we've always said, the path forward will not always be linear. Our margin improvement will not be a straight line particularly as we make the necessary investments to support innovation and drive trial and distribution across our brands. Margins may also move around quarter-to-quarter as we confront dynamics, like inflation, exiting lower margin businesses, and enhancing our portfolio with margin accretive acquisitions. As I said at our inaugural investor day, when you take on a transformation of this magnitude there will be quarterly volatility in gross margin from time to time. But regardless of short-term dynamics, we will move the centerline of our profitability north over time.","As I noted earlier, there were a few near-term factors impacting our gross margin performance. Better than expected top line performance through Q2 is enabling us to invest more in our U.S. retail business and add incremental support to further enhance the distribution, merchandizing, and consumer trial of our brands, especially where we have new renovation and innovation. As I mentioned earlier, this is consistent with our strategy to increase brand saliency with consumers. This increased investment had a near-term impact on our overall price mix, which is reflected in our results this quarter. Some of this will show up as slotting, and some of this will show up as priced given the structure of our joint business planning partnerships with customers this is not surprising.","Simply put, we are focused on strategic investments behind higher quality product presentation, and our investments will be brand and customer specific as we both reacquaint consumers with legacy brands and introduce new offerings to the market. We are strategically using trade as a catalyst for our modernized brands. This fuels new distribution, better shelf presentation, end-aisle display, and customer circular visibility to generate awareness of the new relevant benefits of our products. Dave will provide a bit more detail on the additional factors that impacted near-term gross margin performance shortly. But the bottom line is that none of these factors change our long-term margin outlook or our commitment to chip away at the margin opportunity over time.","Now turning to our segment performance on slide 12, you can see the continued growth in our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, which was aided this quarter by innovation launched under the Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice, and Banquet trademarks. In addition, the Frontera brand introduced frozen mean innovation, and we also saw continued growth in the core Reddi-wip business. On slide 13, you can see scanner data that highlights the acceleration in this segment. Looking at the chart on the left, you can see the top line improvement in our frozen single-serve meal business through the end of Q2, which we believe is the best proxy for the traction of our plan. As you know, our recent brand renovation work focused on Frozen.","And within Frozen, we put significant effort toward renovating Banquet, the largest single-serve frozen meal brand by volume in the U.S., after considerable effort to modernize the brand and recondition shoppers to purchase the products off shelf at full margin, Banquet returned to growth in the second quarter. We're pleased to have this brand back on track, and are encouraged by the positive consumer response. We're also mindful of our expectation for the brand and its role in our portfolio as a reliable contributor. We do not expect Banquet to be a rapid grower growing forward, but it is a large important brand. We're very pleased to have liberated it from a $1 retail price point, and to have improved both top and bottom line performance.","Overall, you can begin to get a sense for why we feel good about our growth algorithm both this year and for the long-term. One of the most compelling reasons for our optimism continues to be the success of our innovation slate which is building distribution and performing well in its early days in the market. We started rebuilding our innovation slate with a focus on our Frozen business, and you can expect to see us apply the same level of rigor and discipline across our portfolio where we see opportunity.","Turning to our Grocery and Snacks segment on slide 15, you can see that we're continuing to drive improvement. We estimate organic sales were roughly flat for the quarter after adjusting for the hurricanes. That's a significant improvement over Q1. Our Q2 Grocery and Snacks reported sales reflect approximately 200 basis points of positive impact related to the hurricanes, which drove customer warehouse and consumer pantry stocking behavior. While this was a benefit in Q2, we expect the shift to negatively impact Q3 sales in this segment. The improvement in the base business is encouraging, but it is still very early days. We have a lot of work to do ahead to renovate certain brands and provide the appropriate investment support, similar to the work we've done with our Frozen portfolio.","So let me take a step back and provide some perspective on how we think about this segment. Clearly we see Snacks as an attractive growth opportunity. As a reminder, our snacks business includes strong brands such as Slim Jim, one of the leading players in mean snacks with increasing household penetration among millennials; Orville Redenbacher, the largest selling brand in microwave popcorn and the best selling brand of popcorn online; David Seeds, the leader in seeds with more than twice the share of the next largest competitor; Swiss Miss, which accounts for over half of the volume of hot cocoa sold in U.S. retail, it's also the preferred choice of millennials by more than four times over the nearest competitor; and Act II which is growth both domestically and internationally.","We're also very pleased with the robust performance of recently added brands such as Duke's, Bigs, and Frontera. And we're quite excited about the opportunities presented by the acquisition of Angie's Boom Chicka Pop. So overall, snacks will be an extremely important area for us going forward, and we're just getting warmed up. We'll be sharing more about snacking renovation and innovation in the months to come.","As we articulated at investor day, a simple way to think about our large grocery business is to break it into two groups; condiments and enhancers, and shelf stable meals and sides. We do that because generally speaking these groups will play different roles over time. With condiments and enhancers, such as Hunt's Tomatoes, Ro-Tel, Frontera Salsa, and Pam, we see on-trend brands that align with the needs of young millennial households which are starting to cook affordable by flavorful meals at home. Accordingly, they will be a focus area for continued investment. The role of shelf stable means and side dishes such as Chef Boyardee, Libby's, and La Choy is to be reliable contributors, providing steady cash flow to fund growth opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio. That doesn't mean, we will neglect these brands to the contrary, we absolutely need to keep them fresh so they continue to reliably contribute.","Overall, we remain focused on our disciplined portfolio segmentation approach to apply the appropriate support for each brand. So while it's early days, we're happy with our growth momentum and we're excited about the future. Importantly, we're growing share and our categories are growing with our sharpened focus and enhanced capabilities we have reason to be excited about our future. And before I wrap up, a few thoughts on M&A, as you can see on Slide 19, we have been highly active leveraging M&A to reshape our portfolio for better long-term growth and margins, clearly the inbound businesses have been smaller modernizing acquisitions versus larger more synergistic deals.","You should not interpret that as a string of pearl strategy in lieu of more transformational deals. As I've said many times, we are always on the lookout for both modernizing and synergistic acquisitions the former tend to be more plentiful than the latter but we're always in a position of readiness should the right property and the reasonable valuation emerge.","Earlier today, we announced our planned acquisition of the Sandwich Bros. business simply put this is a frozen capability play, handhelds offer great convenience to consumers and this business provides some terrific capabilities. These are freshly prepared delicious sandwiches that are then flash frozen to be ready when you are, they play across breakfast, lunch and dinner. The business generated approximately $60 million in net sales over the past year and is growing rapidly.","Once this deal is closed, we expect to see some exciting expansions of this on-trend format both under the Sandwich Bros. line and other ConAgra Brands. I'll wrap it up with Slide 21, in summary we're encouraged by our return to growth and the performance of our innovation. We'll continue to support growth through disciplined and strategic investments to drive distribution, merchandising and trial.","Executional excellence remains a key focus in everything that we do particularly as we move through an inflationary environment. As we just discussed, we'll stay active in our pursuit of value enhancing M&A and will be relentless about doing what's necessary to deliver our long-term algorithm. Given our strong performance, we've updated our 2018 guidance to reflect organic net sales and adjusted EPS to be near the high end of their respective guidance ranges.","With that, I'll hand it over to Dave to share more on the details of the quarter. Dave, over to you?","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean. Good morning everyone and happy holidays. As you can see on Slide 23, we continue to make strong progress improving our financial profile as we reshape our portfolio. Reported net sales for the second quarter were up 4.1% and organic net sales were up 2.3% reflecting significant sequential improvement in our net sales growth from previous quarters. As mentioned in our release, we estimate 220 basis points of sales improvement from the hurricanes across both our grocery and snacks and food service segments.","Adjusted gross profit dollars were up $5 million or 0.7% for the quarter. Adjusted gross margin was 30.1% for the second quarter, down approximately 100 basis points from the prior year. I will discuss the drivers of gross profit in more detail shortly.","A&P expense decreased 11.7% or $11 million in the second quarter. As Sean discussed, we look at total marketing investment which includes A&P spending along with trade spending and slotting that is charged to net sales, when taken together for the quarter total marketing investment increased as the decrease in A&P investment was more than offset by increased trade investments to expand distribution with slotting, to enhance presence and to generate consumer trial.","We also increased merchandising for certain brands to better leverage improved ROI events identified in our trade productivity work. These marketing investments were important to our strong volume growth in the quarter. Adjusted SG&A increased 4.1% or $8 million in the second quarter versus a year ago in line with our second quarter net sales growth.","Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 9.5% for the quarter, the same as the second quarter a year ago and remains top tier in the industry. SG&A as a percentage of net sales is expected to be lower in the second quarter than for the full year since the second quarter is typically our largest sales quarter.","Adjusted operating profit was up $8 million or 2.2% for the quarter. Dollar profit increases from positive volume growth more than offset the negative impact of both inflation and the increase in total marketing investment.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.55 for the quarter which was up 12% and exceeded our expectations. I will discuss the drivers of this increase shortly. Slide 24 outlines the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago, total company organic net sales were up 2.3% driven by volume in price mix improvement.","As mentioned in our earnings release, about 220 basis points of the second quarter net sales growth was from increased shipments related to the hurricanes experienced in the quarter. Organic volume increased 1.7% driven by growth in the Grocery and Snacks and Refrigerated and Frozen reporting segments.","Price mix increased primarily from favorable product and customer sales mix and food service along with positive pricing in the International segment. This was partially offset by increased investments to expand distribution, enhance shelf presence and generate consumer trial in our Grocery and Snacks and Refrigerated and Frozen segments.","The acquisitions of the Frontera, Duke's and BIGS brands in fiscal 2017 and Angie's Boom Chicka Pop in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 added about 140 basis points to second quarter net sales growth.","The impact of FX also contributed 40 basis points of reported net sales growth. Slide 25 highlights our net sales and adjusted operating profit and margin by reporting segment. All operating segments grew both reported and organic net sales in the second quarter versus a year ago and overall operating profit grew 2.2% to 16.7% of net sales.","In our Grocery and Snack segment, reported net sales of $900 million were up 5.5%. The acquisitions of Frontera, Duke's, BIGS and Angie's Boom Chicka Pop added 330 basis points of growth in the quarter. Organic net sales grew 2.2%. The company estimate that the recent hurricanes benefited the grocery and snacks net sales growth rates by approximately 200 basis points driven by our estimates of consumer pantry stocking and customer inventory builds. We expect that this dynamic will have a negative impact in the third quarter. Volume increased 3.4% in the quarter driven by hurricane related demand and increased investment and higher quality merchandising events on certain brands. This investment resulted in a price mix decline of 1.2%.","Adjusted operating profit of $212 million decreased 4.5% this decrease was driven by inflation on input costs and transportation costs associated with the recent hurricanes along with increased total marketing investments driven by the investment in higher quality merchandising events partially offset by lower A&P. These increased costs were partially offset by the favorable impacts of volume growth and supply chain realized productivity. In our refrigerated in Frozen segment reported net sales of $758 million grew 2.3% and organic net sales grew 2.2% as the acquisition of Frontera added 10 basis points of growth in the quarter.","Volume increased 3.9% due to core business improvements and innovation launches under the Marie Callender's, Healthy Choice and Banquet trademarks. Continued growth in the quarter ready with business and the addition of Frontera frozen innovation also added to top line growth. Investments in trade to drive distribution and Hands off presence and increase consumer trial of new products led to a price mix decline of 1.7% versus a year ago.","Adjusted operating profit of $128 million increased 6.9% in the quarter driven by volume growth and supply chain realized productivity. These improvements were partially offset by increased inflation on input costs and higher total marketing investments were lower A&P was more than offset by trade investments previously mentioned.","In our International segment, reported net sales were approximately $220 million for the up 4.2% versus the prior year. This reflects a 2.1% decline in volume which was offset by a 2.3% improvement and price mix at the international team continues to focus on value over volume. FX favorably impacted net sales in the second quarter by 4%.","Adjusted operating profit was $21 million up 19.9% versus the prior year driven by increased pricing, favorable brand margin mix and favorable FX. In our Food Service segment net sales were approximately $295 million for the quarter up 4.1% versus the prior year. We estimate that the recent hurricanes benefited the net sales growth rate by approximately 10 percentage points.","We continue to implement our value over volume strategy and food service with volume decreasing 7.1% as the companies exceed non-core and low performing business. Price mix increased 11.2% driven by favorable product in customer mix as well as pricing. Adjusted operating profit was $47 million up 48.4% versus the prior year with operating margins expanding 481 basis points versus the prior year. ","The operating profit performance was driven by the sales increase from pricing and customer and product mix. Adjusted corporate expenses were $46 million for the quarter up 27% reflecting an increase in certain self-insurance costs and a reduction in income from transition service agreements. Total adjusted SG&A of $206 million in the second quarter was up 4.1% versus a year ago in line with our reported net sales growth.","Moving to slide 26, this chart outlines the drivers of the 12% adjusted diluted EPS improvement in the second quarter versus a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars increased $5 million in the second quarter driving $0.01 of EPS improvement. Gross profit was favorably impacted by volume increases in the Grocery and Snacks and Refrigerated and Frozen segments along with favorable price mix in the Food Service and International segments.","Gross profit was negatively impacted by elevated inflation of approximately 4% in the quarter driven by increases in animal proteins, oils, dairy and packaging along with increases in transportation and warehousing costs as a result of the hurricanes.","Gross profit was also impacted by the increase in total marketing investment to expand distribution and generate consumer trial. These cost increases were partially offset by favorability and supply chain realized productivity for the second quarter. Favorable interest expense and an increase in equity income from Ardent Mills added $0.03 of EPS improvement which share repurchases adding $0.04.","EPS was negatively impacted by $0.02 as the effective tax rate in the second quarter was 34.4% versus 32.4% a year ago. The tax rate increase primarily from higher deductions for stock option exercises in the prior year and an increase to our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to state taxes.","Slide 27 summarizes selected balance sheet and cash flow information for the quarter. Net cash flow from operating activities of continuing operations was $383 million for the year-to-date period down from $461 million for the same period a year ago. This decrease was primarily from the timing of tax payments versus the prior year. Dividends paid are down as the prior year second quarter dividend occurred prior to the Lamb Weston spin off and was paid at the prior ConAgra Foods rate.","We repurchased approximately 8 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $280 million in the second quarter. Total share repurchases for the first half of fiscal 2018 amount to $580 million. We ended the second quarter with net debt of approximately $3.4 billion as planned up from $2.7 billion fiscal year end 2017. This increase supported our share repurchases and the $250 million acquisition of Angie's Boom Chicka Pop which closed in the second quarter. As we have stated previously, we remain committed to an investment grade rating for the business. As outlined in our earnings release, we continue to cooperate fully with the FTC as it conducts its review of the Wesson transaction.","Slide 28 outlines our updated guidance for fiscal 2018. We expect organic net sales growth to be near the high end of our range which was previously communicated at minus 2%-to-flat. Reported net sales is expected to be 100 to 150 basis points higher than the organic net sales growth rate due to acquisitions and FX. We expect adjusted operating margin to be near the low end of our range of 15.9% to 16.3%. We now expect inflation to be 3.7% for the full year, up from 3.3% full-year estimate we provided in the first quarter. This higher inflation along with the incremental marketing investments we started this quarter will impact our gross margins in the second half. We remain on track for our fiscal 2020 long-term targets communicated at investor day, including a gross margin of 32% in fiscal year 2020.","While our updated effective tax rate guidance is between 33.5% and 34.5%, we are in the process of assessing the extent of the positive impact from the new federal tax legislation. We expected adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to be near the high end of our range, which is $1.84 to $1.89. We remain on track to repurchase approximately $1.1 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2018 subject to market and other conditions, including the absence of any synergistic acquisition. Our fiscal 2018 outlook includes the full-year estimated financial results of the Wesson business since the sale is still pending.","In summary, our transformation is squarely on track. ConAgra Brands continues to make excellent progress. We continue to bend the trend on organic sales, and have made great progress upgrading our volume base. Gross profits and operating profits grew year-over-year, while we weathered elevated inflation and funded incremental marketing investments to support growth. We've made several modernizing acquisitions over the last year, and our balance sheet remains strong and gives us flexibility to pursue synergistic acquisition opportunities to drive shareowner value. And we are confirming our full-year organic net sales and EPS guidance near the high end of the range.","Thank you. This concludes my remarks. Sean, Tom McGough, and I will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody, and happy holidays.","Sean Connolly","Morning.","Andrew Lazar","Two questions, one would just be are you planning on, it sounds like it, but continuing with the incremental trade spend above the net sales line that we saw in the second quarter through the back half of the year. And if so, I guess what gives you the comfort that you're seeing the kind of return on that spend that you expect and such that it's not generating volume that maybe isn't sustainable? And then I've got a follow-up.","Sean Connolly","Yes, good morning, Andrew. Yes, this is Sean. We will continue to invest above the line and below the line behind the brands in the second half. When we got off to a strong start in the year it gave us the opportunity to do that as well as anticipating a tax reform. And the simple logic for that is with all the work we've done and put into building our innovation pipeline when we get our new innovations in the marketplace, particularly in stores at the point of purchase, it is critical that we build awareness around these new benefits and around the new modernized look of these products.","Internally we've got a phrase here a phrase here that we use that use called \"confidential innovation\". And what we mean by that is when we do all the work building out our innovation pipeline the last thing we want is to get it into the marketplace and have nobody see it. If that would be the case we'd call that confidential innovation. So we're trying to avoid that obviously. We're trying to create consumer awareness and let our package design and the food itself, the look of the food, the varieties, the modern flavors drive consumer pull. And we're highly confident that because of the quality of the food we're putting into products this year, in particular in frozen meals, that we will get strong repeat. And the early data that we're seeing on that bodes well.","So, as we look at the return on these startup investments over time we expect them to be quite strong, but strategically we view it as vital to getting the right kind of uptick particularly given we really took a last year or year-and-a-half off when it came to new innovation.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks for that. And then as M&A continues to be an active part of ConAgra's, particularly in snacks, I guess I wondered if you could comment on your view on maybe some of the multiples that we've seen some snack assets trade at more recently, and how that sort of fits into your desire obviously to continue to be disciplined but also try and use the balance sheet in an accretive way.","Sean Connolly","Yes, obviously M&A is an important part of our playbook going forward. And we've all seen high multiples in M&A in food in general for the last few years. Snacks is the flavor this week. We had condiments last quarter; we had other things before that. So it's been a high multiple environment. And in that environment we try to strike the right balance between our desire to be aggressive with M&A to help reshape our portfolio for better growth and better margins, but also to be disciplined.","So we understand that there are higher multiples out there, but we still hold ourselves to pretty high standards in terms of being able to get an IRR on our deals that is above our weighted average to capital. So that's one of the ways we look at getting proper return on our M&A investments and we'll continue to strike the right balance between being aggressive and being disciplined going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Just two follow-ups to Andrew's questions, first I guess as we think about gross margins going forward and the continued investments. As the investment shifts more to grocery and retail, that becomes a bigger part of the innovation, is that less expensive to sort of renovate and launch new products that it is in frozen. So even as we think about that into next year would it potentially be less of a drag on gross margins and require less of a gross investment than is the case in frozen food?","Sean Connolly","Well, we have different brands across our portfolio. The consumer domains that we've talked about before, we've got meals which tends to lean toward frozen, we've got enhancers, and we've got snacks. You're going to continue to see us do probably bolder innovation on the meals and snacks consumer domains. And what you'll see more in the grocery part of the store and enhancers looks more like renovation. So may not be as much on new slotting there. Maybe things like updating the look of our products. Probably some skew varieties, but a bit of a different mix. I think the bigger point here is that we look at marketing in total, meaning above-the-line marketing spend and below-the-line marketing spend.","And when we use the phrase marketing behind our brands we're referring to investments that engage the consumer with our brands. And that could be everything from traditional TV and print ads, to distribution investments, to merchandizing, to sampling, to digital marketing, even customer loyalty programs. So you've got a wide array of activities here -- marketing activities that span above net sales and below net sales cost buckets. And as we move our activity mix it may toggle spend above the line and below the line, and we'll try to be transparent with you all around what those activities are and why we're doing them.","When we're on ramp-up mode on things that are quite materially different from how the brands looked in the past, think frozen so far this year with all the work we've done, we really focus our energy disproportionately on the in-store environment and centre store because that's where we get the biggest engagement with consumers around these meaningfully revitalized brands in that startup mode. And that's why we're doing what we're doing right now because we believe it's going to get us the best long-term top line performance and the best ultimate returns.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, thanks. And then just a follow-up on M&A, just one of the themes I guess that's come across throughout the last six to 12 months is it just seems like the cost of business is going up. And maybe that's a function of what's happening in the retail environment. So that being the case, do you think that that's going to motivate more synergy type deals to happen? Seems like a lot of the acquisitions, the M&A that we've seen across food and beverages have really been growth deals, and not as many synergy type deals. But if the cost of business is going higher and it's becoming more complex, do you think that scale becomes more important, and maybe that's going to start motivating more synergy type opportunities to come up?","Sean Connolly","Well, I think in the last few years growth has been on average more elusive for the industry. And when you see those cycles emerge where growth is more elusive you tend to hear more talk around consolidation and harvesting synergies. But as a potential participant in some of those deals we want to focus on our shareholders and the return we get for our shareholders. And obviously synergies are great. But when you give away all your synergies in a deal to the seller it's not particularly useful to our shareholders. So we're going to always keep our shareholders in mind as we think about portfolio changes that ultimately position us for long-term strength and value creation.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. In your opening comments you talked about inflation rising faster than you thought. Are you going to have to raise your prices faster as a result, and do you expect a lag? Is that part of the guidance or not, I didn't quite catch that?","And then the second thing, and this is just a question about your average pricing at retail still being high but your trade promotion also being higher. Given all the disputes with -- the very public disputes with retailers, is there anything that you see in the industry where the vendors are giving the retailers more money but it's not making its way wall the way to the consumer? Like we all see promotion being lower than it was a year ago and prices being higher than a year ago. But then all of our vendors are experiencing gross margin. So is it possible that the retailer is just getting some of that money and keeping it for themselves in some form or fashion?","Sean Connolly","Rob, let me tell you how I think about that. Let me start with the second half of your question first around trade investments. I think it's a very simple mental model that a lot of investors have that when we talk trade we're talking putting that money right into deep discounting and deals. Increasingly that is not really anywhere near the full story. It's more about joint business planning with customers around everything from merchandising, which usually has some level of discount to it, in our case nowhere near the depths that we had historically. But it also has to do with points of distribution.","It has to do with quality of shelf space and facings. Is it eyelevel or is it down in the well, the ability to sample products in store, the ability to target consumers on their apps that are customer-specific. So trade and customer investment is much more holistic than just deep discounting deals, and features, and things that you've heard about historically. And certainly in our case that is true. Keep in mind we've invested a fair amount in improving our trade efficiency capabilities. So we've now got post-event analytic tools, we've got trade planning management tools. We are able to look at thousands upon thousands of trade events, find the ones that are low ROI, get rid of those, and find the ones that are positive ROI and do more of those because we get more bang for our buck. Some of that is the structure of the merchandizing, some of it is timing.","So we are spending above the line, but it is what I would describe as a significantly higher quality investment in terms of engaging consumers in our brands than what it used to be at ConAgra, which was really about taking very outdated and old fashioned products and just moving them based on deep, deep discounting. And as you saw in the slides, our promoted levels are down overall, and our pricing is up and above our categories.","Now with respect to pricing, just a couple of thoughts on pricing, as I pointed out before, we've built an integrated margin management team and improved our pricing capabilities dramatically versus what we had just a few years ago. And over the past few years we've taken more price than most. And we think about pricing three ways. There's number one, inflation justified pricing; number two, trade efficiency, and I just talked a little bit about that; and three, premium-priced innovation which over time will be positive mix. So clearly pricing is complex when you pivot from deflation to inflation you want to price as fast as you can. Sometimes there's a lag. And sometimes if the inflation appears transitory on certain commodities and the forward curves drop back down retailers can be more reluctant to take price because they don't want constant shelf price volatility. And then the last factor is that not every brand and every category are created equal in terms of elasticities of demand.","So all of this is why we are principally committed to pricing when justified, but also why we focus on the center line of our profitability over time and not on quarterly volatility because there tends to be a fair amount of noise.","Dave Marberger","Yes, and I just want to add to that as it relates to gross margin the broader question first-half and then as we look forward. As we mentioned, inflation will be higher in the second-half. We will continue the marketing investments that Sean just talked about, and pricing where we've already taken it we've already taken it on several brands. It's important to understand the impact of food service in the second quarter and the benefit we got from that, and that not repeating in the second-half. And so when you look at that and also the volume in grocery\/snacks that's going to negatively impact the third quarter. When you add all that up it's going to result in the second-half gross margins being in line with the first-half gross margins generally speaking. And that really drives ultimately our operating margin guidance that we gave.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thank you. And I imagine, like your peers, the answer will be it's too early to say. But I wanted to ask a little bit about your thoughts on the benefits of tax. Is there anything you should be aware of in terms of major offsets to you guys in particular from a lower corporate rate, and any early thoughts you have on how much of a benefit you'll let flow to the bottom line versus spending back on wages, CapEx, and pricing? Just any general thoughts would be very appreciated.","Dave Marberger","Sure, Ken. Let me start, and then Sean can jump in. So I'll start with the tax rate, right. So if you look the last two years we've been about a 33% effective tax rate. Obviously with the corporate rate now dropping to 21% we'll clearly benefit from that. But there are other component provisions of the new bill that we need to understand, so things like the domestic manufacturing deduction, we benefited from that. Well, that's now gone, right. So that will be an impact to the rate. So we're still going through that process to understand how our effective tax rate will change, but we know we will benefit from it.","Another just tactical thing as it relates to this fiscal year, since we are a May filer and the bill is effective January 1, our fiscal year '18 effective tax rate will be a blended rate. So that's another component where we have to go through and figure out the seven-month to 35%, five-month to 21%, how does that affect it. So that will be -- we'll be more clear on that in the third quarter. As it relates to investment clearly the incremental profit cash that will be generated is part of our ongoing evaluation of all our capital allocation assessment, right. So, ConAgra is a growth story. So we're always looking at investments to increase shareowner value.","So whether it's CapEx, and obviously there's benefits now of more immediate deduction related to CapEx, total marketing which we've started to accelerate that investment in the second quarter, as we've just talked about, technology investments, human resources, even things like the pension plan and things that we could do around that. So we're constantly looking at those things, and we're in the process of doing that. So as we move forward we'll be more transparent on decisions we make around that, but we're making those evaluations as we always do with our capital.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thank you for that. My second question is, I know you don't want to give specific quarterly guidance on certain items, but Dave, you were a minute ago, I think to Rob Moskow's question, you're giving some reason for not necessarily caution, but reason why guidance isn't necessarily conservative in the back half of the year. I just wanted to ask more particularly on the third quarter just to avoid any investor surprises. As we think about the reversal of the hurricane impact and some of the other -- the food service item that you mentioned, is it possible that EPS in the third quarter could be down year-on-year as a result of the reversal of these certain trends or is that not something that you think is necessarily likely at this point?","Dave Marberger","Yes, we're not going to give specific quarterly guidance on anything, particularly EPS or whatever else. What I will say is that as you look at inflation we've obviously taken our estimate up for the year. There are dynamics in the third quarter with inflation and with the volume that we shipped in the second quarter for Grocery and Snacks. Another dynamic is that, if you remember last year in the fourth quarter, we started to see inflation hitting us. So we will start to wrap on it in the fourth quarter. So that's why as you look at the second-half we wont see quite as much inflation as based on our estimates now in the fourth quarter as opposed to the third quarter. So there are the dynamics, but I'm not going to give specific EPS for Q3 or Q4 just given all the different dynamics.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Sean Connolly","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just had a question for you on as I'm thinking about the timeline for new product innovation, kind of how that phases through the year. And then just to understand, I think you said that marketing was up, but I know that you indicated that A&P was down, meaning the promotion was up. Was that the missing link to -- marketing, and can you just quantify how much that was up for the quarter?","Sean Connolly","Yes, on innovation, Chris, we will continue to have innovation coming out in the back half of the year and we'll have startup support behind that. Some of it with some customers shows up as slotting, some of it just goes into debt net. But it is a diverse means of supporting the brands from actual physical distribution, as I mentioned, to quality of shelving, to in-store support. All of those things are the things that we're doing disproportionately. So what you saw in Q2 was some reduction of A&P that was then moved above the line, and then additional expense above the line in support of the brands in an in-store environment.","Dave Marberger","And just to add to that, because I can say that if you look at the $11 million reduction in A&P in the second quarter the amount of increase in trade of the line that supported distribution, including slotting, and all the investments to get additional distribution more than offset that $11 million. We don't give specific numbers on total trade, but that is clearly the case for the A&P being more than offset by the investment in distribution.","Sean Connolly","And one thing to keep in mind as well going forward, we talked about this a little bit last quarter is, we're coming off of a base period where we didn't really have a lot of, what I'll call, brand support in the base, startup support, innovation support because we pushed the pause button last year while we rebuilt the funnel. So as we get these investments into our base this year we won't see the magnitude of year-on-year changes going forward because we're getting back to more normal going innovation launch cadence.","Chris Growe","Okay. And just a quick question if I could follow-up on the input cost inflation, that's gone up about a hundred basis points from the start of the year, and for obvious reasons around the hurricane in particular. How much of that is hedged now? Like do you still see further risk to that or you have a good read on at least the second half of '18 on input cost inflation.","Dave Marberger","Chris, it really varies by commodity area. So certain commodities we can lock in, certain ones we can't. So proteins we don't have as much ability to do that. Obviously we're halfway through the year so in certain commodities we're pretty locked in. So I would say animal proteins would be the biggest area of still potential exposure given any volatility in the market.","Operator","The next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great, thanks a lot. I want to follow on the innovation questions. So can you update us on where the company is as regards the goal that you laid out at the analyst day, I believe it was 15% of net sales from innovation? Where are you right now? And then can you tell us what the significant second-half innovations are, I assume you've already announced it to the trade, but I don't think you really mentioned it in the script? And then I do have a follow-up.","Sean Connolly","Yes, sure. David, what you're referring to is a slide that we put up. It wasn't technically part of our guidance, but it was kind of a true north for us on innovation that we'd like to march towards over time. It's something we called renewal rate which is the percentage of annual sales that come from prior three-year innovations. And our point was that our company historically had been in the high single digits. Companies that are doing well and best in class are closer to 15%. So our aim over time is to really close that gap. It's not as if we need to get to 15% on a straight line march from where we started. And by the way, it's also something -- it's not the kind of metric you're going to look at on a quarterly basis, you've got to settle it in.","But clearly, as you can imagine, with the slate of innovation that we've got hitting the marketplace now by the time we get to this year, we will see a pretty material uptick in that renewal rate. Tom, you want to comment on what's coming in the back half?","Tom McGough","Sure, David. There's really two things; one, we have an opportunity, two, and we are accelerating some new items on Healthy Choice Power Bowls. We've had a tremendous introduction and success on that line, and many retailers are picking in the next phase of products in the second half. Banquet Mega has been a really, really strong performer, and that's another area that we'll continue to build distribution through the balance of the year. And then as we get to the latter parts of the second half, our next wave of innovation will ship likely at the end of Q4 in some retailers. All this is really based on the end-market momentum that we have, the high incrementality that our innovation is driving within the category and retailers are leveraging our brands for their growth, and as a result, we're accelerating our new products in those areas in the second half.","Sean Connolly","Just one other building on Tom's comments David one other thing that we're always thinking about which is we've got to wrap this year slate next year and it's not lost on us that we will be wrapping next year a big slate and as a result, you should assume that we've been very aggressive in making sure that our innovation slate for next year is going to be as impressive as this year. I continue to talk about frozen and how I think we have years and years of runway on frozen, undoubtedly we're going to continue to have a big slate there, you'll hear us talk more about some of these things that CAG is coming up after the holidays but then snacking is a big area for us and some of the most innovative things we've got going on as a company are some of the acquisitions we've made.","Duke's is clearly one of the most innovative brands in the very hot meat snack space and now with Angie's Boom Chicka Pop as the national leader of branded ready to eat popcorn that's if that's a business we can do a lot with going forward. So you'll hear more about what comes next when we're at some invest meetings in the new calendar year.","David Driscoll","Okay, that's really helpful. I think the message right there is this innovation is going to continue at a strong pace, my follow up is just on the hurricanes, so I believe that the two major hurricanes one was at the end of August, one was at the beginning of September. So can you just maybe walk me through a little bit here of why the pantry loading would impact December and January, i.e. next quarter fiscal third quarter shouldn't we have seen any kind of negative impacts in like October and November? I'm thinking that this stuff should have been contained but I feel like your comments have been telling us about 2Q benefits from hurricanes that will negatively impact Q3. So I'm really just trying to get a sense of the size and really a little bit of the rationale behind it?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I think in our retail business, David, the dynamics we saw in the hurricane were very similar to the things that I've experienced throughout my long career in the world of food, which is when you have shelf stable goods that are either in meals or in snacks, you're tended to see a fair amount of stocking both warehouse stocking with customers and pantry stocking in and around the hurricanes. And in my experience there're almost always higher levels of stocking than there is immediate term consumption. So what we experienced, what we experienced last quarter to me was textbook with what I've experienced throughout my career. There is one particular nuance that's worth mentioning, which is specific to Chef Boyardee, just to provide a little bit more color on this and that is that our quarter two Chef saw some pretty significant impact on Chef we had previously negotiated much higher impact merchandising events in quarter two this year than last year with those key events timed around back to school.","So in other words, we planned more trade support in the quarter. As it turns out, those major events that we planned upfront just happened to coincide timing wise with the hurricanes and the effect this had was to move a ton of volume but at compressed gross margins. So while inflation on his brand was up a good bit, the hurricane fueled sales spike came while the brand was on deal for back to school, so while we got far more takeaway than we originally expected, we also got a bit more margin compression on that business than we expected and higher absolute trade expenses and to your point as we mentioned earlier because a fair amount of that is sitting in could we believe is sitting in consumer pantries we expect to get some of that back in Q3 as consumers work through that inventory and that dynamic there is not different from what I've experienced before.","Brian Kearney","One more question, I think we've got.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey, guys. Thank you for squeezing me. I really appreciate it and congratulations really been in the trend here and top line it's encouraging to see. We've covered a lot of ground , so just kind of follow off on a couple of the questions already asked, first on Rob Moscow's question about less on the trade spend side a bit more on retailers taking some margin. We're clearly seeing it selectively in soup right now; can you give us a little more clarity on whether you're seeing in any of your categories?","Sean Connolly","Yes, we are seeing it, but let me go back to what I said before on this, because I think it's a really important point and I think it's a different experience with ConAgra than maybe what you all see elsewhere in the industry which is on a lot of our brands we saw a retailer margin compression for years and the reason that happens because our brands were locked into very low price points usually a dollar or a $0.99 or a $1.99.","So in other words, over decades ConAgra saw compressed margins and our retailer saw compressed margins and as you can imagine and I mention as before when we talked to retailers about our aggressive innovation slate, one of the reasons why they were very supportive of it and our goal to modernize brands was actually the opposite of what a lot of times we hear about, which is a desire to take prices lower in our case it was a desire to take prices higher. And as we did that build back in better retailer margins so case in point there is Healthy Choice Power Bowls. We still have a small sliver of Healthy Choices that are these classic meals that are sold to older boomers that business has gotten smaller as we kind of sunset that piece of it but we are replacing it with higher margin.","Higher dollar in businesses like Healthy Choice simply and now Healthy Choice Power Bowls, which are not only higher price points but better margin structure for our retailers. So we are participating and rebuilding retailer margins but in our case we're doing in the context of modernized brands with higher absolute price points and higher absolute food quality.","Jason English","Thank you. That's really helpful and then one quick follow-up to I think Goldman's question on retention of tax benefits you made a comment about ramping trade spend both in the wake of your success both in the -- ahead of your innovation space, but also you referenced anticipation tax reform. Should I interrupt to mean that we should expect a bit more trade, a bit more promo in the wake of tax reform and other portfolio? And because you do you dabble a bit of private label on I'm curious your perspective there. In a post tax reform environment we already in the bid process it's been pretty aggressive would you expect the benefits to bid away more rapidly in private label and is there any risk that causes price gap issues and this isn't just a ConAgra question it's an industry wide question any perspective you could share be appreciated?","Sean Connolly","On that latter piece, Jason, I'm not any more concerned this quarter than I've been previous quarters about private label as I've mentioned before. Private label on average under indexes in our categories it's about a 70 index versus food on average and in key strategic categories like frozen it's significantly lower than that so I'm not anticipating any change, it's not built into our planning posture in terms of private label interaction getting to be more of a headwind.","With respect to investing behind our business in trade but I wouldn't over think this is a simple way to think about it is we were in launch mode in the front half of this year and we knew, we have we want to support our brand because we're trying to build future cash flows here by reestablishing consumer loyalty and household penetration on our brands and when we saw the early traction on the business when we saw we got up to a fast start of the year and fueled in part by a high degree of confidence, we're going to get a tax return.","We made the strategic decision to put more money behind our businesses because we had confidence in our brands and in our innovation and by and large we got the response that we were looking for and that's bit of a higher level of support as we continue to launch stuff through the back half of the year and then next year we will wrap some of these levels investments will be baked into our core, so I wouldn't anticipate another step up as we move into the out years I think we're going to kind of get it in our base here as we proceed. But at the end of the day the fact that we've got traction on these brands and our investments are working in terms of driving consumer trial, and we have confidence in the products themselves to drive repeat. This is all part of a positive flywheel in our view.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Kearney for any closing remarks.","Brian Kearney","So, we weren't able to get to everyone in the Q&A queue, but Investor Relations is around for the rest of the day for any follow-up discussions.

My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning. Happy holidays, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations. Before we get started, Chris has a few words.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. If you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our expected results, perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measure for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the question-and-answer document or on our website.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris. I'll start today with an overview of ConAgra Foods as a whole and then share more specifics on each of our new business segments.","We're very pleased to be able to deliver year-over-year growth in EPS, up 9% on a comparable basis. To be clear, that's ahead of what we were expecting for the second quarter. Our stronger-than-planned EPS for the quarter reflects a better-than-expected profit performance from our Consumer Foods segment, which I'll say more about in a minute.","After our first quarter performance, we needed to take some corrective actions to improve our performance, and we did that. But some of the quarter's EPS growth is timing, meaning a shift across quarters. In essence, we got some results in the second quarter that we originally planned to occur early in the third quarter. Given this timing shift and several short-term issues, we're appropriately cautious about our second half of the year and sticking with the prior fiscal 2014 EPS guidance despite the over-delivery in Q2. We believe that's the prudent approach in today's environment. This still represents good year-over-year EPS growth in the back half, and we're committed to delivering it. Keep in mind, our guidance represents 8% to 10% growth over last year.","Now I'll go into some detail on our 3 business segments. As a reminder, the integration of the former Ralcorp business has led us to the decision to segment our financial reporting differently. The new segments represent how we think about and manage our business. This is the first quarter we're reporting results under these new segments. The details of that are in our earnings release, and John will address the changes, in his remarks, we'll be making today and on a go-forward basis about our new Consumer Foods, Commercial Foods and Private Brands business segments.","Within the new Consumer Foods segment, sales were flat due to flat volumes and flat price\/mix. The sequential volume improvement is good to see. And while some of the merchandising programs we launched during the quarter worked well, we're attributing a good part of the sequential volume improvement to more normalized inventory positions at certain retail customers, who were rebuilding some previously reduced inventories. Some of this is in connection with the holiday season. We feel good about our merchandising strategies and believe the sharper pricing architecture we're deploying is on target, but we are very aware that consumption trends in a few categories remain soft.","We posted double-digit comparable operating profit growth in Consumer Foods. While sequential volume improvement was important, the comparable profit growth largely reflects manageable inflation, effective cost of goods productivity initiatives and SG&A reductions. The SG&A savings include reduced advertising and promotion costs, reflecting heavy investment a year ago and, now, more focus on spending productivity. Keep in mind, we have a focused effort to redeploy some advertising into merchandising investment as we navigate the current competitive environment and as we focus on productivity. And we're starting to see the results.","Looking ahead, marketplace conditions indicate ongoing challenges. Retailers are adjusting their plans for programs, merchandising and category emphasis on a more frequent basis. And that, of course, impacts us and the rest of the industry, resulting in some choppiness. We're fully committed to ongoing smart merchandising programs with customers, and we're seeing that strategy positively impact some important categories in our frozen snacks and shelf-stable grocery businesses. However, we believe the right thing to do is to be conservative in our estimates for payoffs from these programs for the near term.","For more context, we have a few of our bigger brands that continue to perform below expectations. I'm talking about Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's and Healthy Choice. And these are weighing on our full Consumer Foods year volume. We are very focused on thinking differently and are more rigorously addressing each of these brands, but we aren't forecasting much change over the next quarter or 2.","We like what we've seen in some other areas of the business, specifically Hunt's and Ro*Tel Tomatoes, and key holiday items, like Reddi-wip and Marie Callender desserts. And we're encouraged by some very strong individual brand performances across the portfolio.","To summarize, we currently project Consumer Foods volumes to be slightly down for the back half of the year, which means the full year volume will be down slightly.","As John will highlight, we expect to achieve our full year EPS even with the Consumer Foods volumes down a bit. When we put our revised goals together, we knew the top line might be challenging. That's been part of our thinking all along with our revised goals. However, we continue to be confident we will grow Consumer Foods operating profits for the full year, driven by a combination of more favorable inflation rates and ongoing cost savings and productivity initiatives.","Next, I'll cover our Commercial Foods segment, where sales grew primarily due to the Ralcorp acquisition and the fact that the former Ralcorp Bakery results for the foodservice channel are now in this segment.","Profit was down about 9% on a comparable basis, reflecting the loss of business from one large customer at Lamb Weston, which we talked about last quarter. We are clawing some of that back, having picked up incremental business with other customers, and feel confident that, over the long term, we'll get it all back. We're seeing double-digit international sales growth at Lamb Weston, although the growth has not been quite as strong as we planned. Some headwinds in Asia have hung on for a bit longer than anticipated.","While we feel good about growth prospects, both domestically and internationally, in Lamb Weston, we do have a profit challenge that came to light as this year's potato crop was harvested. Some unusual adverse growing conditions impacted the crop and created potatoes that are not optimal for processing efficiencies. And that means our margins for the next few quarters from Lamb Weston will not be quite as strong as we anticipated.","Within ConAgra Mills, the pass-through of lower wheat prices negatively impacted sales. However, profits were in line with year-ago amounts, reflecting operating efficiencies and improved product mix. All of the remaining businesses in Commercial Foods delivered as planned in the quarter, and the legacy Ralcorp Frozen Bakery business transitioned smoothly and performed as expected this quarter.","We announced during the quarter a brief update on our pending Ardent Mills joint venture. As a reminder, we plan to contribute our milling operations, which are part of the Commercial Foods segment, into a joint venture with Cargill and CHS, called Ardent Mills, where we will have 44% ownership. We believe this is a long-term strategic win in terms of customer supply chain solutions, efficiencies, expanded innovation capabilities and, of course, profits. We are now expecting the transaction to be completed in the first quarter of calendar 2014, as opposed to earlier plans, which called for it to close this calendar year. We revised the timeline due to various reasons, including the ongoing regulatory review process and discussions with the U.S. Department of Justice. Forming this venture will also provide us with cash to accelerate our debt repayment. We expect this joint venture to be accretive to our EPS in a couple of years, as we've said before.","All in all, we're shaping our Commercial business to continue its customer-centric focus and offer products and services with strong growth prospects. We've done quite a bit of rewiring within this segment to take advantage of the leadership and capabilities within both ConAgra Foods and the former Ralcorp business, and we believe we're in a good position to capture growth domestically and internationally.","In our third segment, Private Brands, we've taken key steps to organize in a way that sets us up for long-term success. As you know, this segment is largely made up of a significant portion of the former Ralcorp business. And we've also included in this segment a private brand business that we had before acquiring Ralcorp, businesses that were previously part of Consumer Foods.","Sales and profits for Private Brands are not quite as strong as we planned. To be very transparent, our volume recovery is taking longer than expected. As we've discussed before, there were pricing and service issues prior to and during the early transition, which impacted volumes. We've made significant progress on both issues but we're still a work in progress for the next 6 months or so. Let me be clear, we are very confident in our ability to substantially improve the top and bottom line performance of this segment. Private Brands will be a catalyst for growth at ConAgra Foods.","As we talked about last quarter, we have been intensely focused on building the right customer-facing structure and filling critical sales positions, and we have leadership and sales focus in place for 6 distinct businesses within Private Brands now. Service levels are getting better across this business and close to target levels. We're also gradually adjusting our price points in key categories in the marketplace.","During the quarter, we officially launched our new sales organization and galvanized roles, coordination and assignments across the company. Customers have been positive about our newly integrated sales teams. These teams are aligned with customer needs and designed to simplify the customer interaction with us across branded and private brand products. Having one voice to the customer will enable us to be the strategic partner customers are looking for. This is critically important and will gain traction over time.","We continue to have extremely positive meetings with customers, particularly on the product innovation in the Private Brands space. And we have launched product development work with a number of key customers that we'll talk about in the months ahead. All of this strongly confirms the long-term strategic benefit of our portfolio approach.","We continue to be committed to delivering $0.25 of accretion in EPS this fiscal year from the Ralcorp deal. And we also remain committed to our short-term and longer-term synergy estimates, which are on track to deliver. Just as a reminder, the accretion and synergy benefits will show up across all of our business segments.","In closing, we're on track for our fiscal 2014 EPS commitments, meaning a year of 8% to 10% growth, despite a continued challenging environment that has been a bit difficult to forecast. While some drivers and timing of our performance are a bit different now than our earlier plans, we're confident in the earnings outlook. We understand the levers we have to pull to deliver, given our focus on cost savings, synergies, strong customer partnerships and overall execution. I firmly believe we're setting up ConAgra Foods for long-term success, despite some bumps in the road, and that we're in a great position to deliver our fiscal 2015 to 2017 EPS and synergy targets.","And as we look ahead, we'll use our unique position in the food industry, with our breadth and scale across branded, private branded and foodservice, to drive growth. I'm confident in the capabilities we continue to build and our willingness to do what it takes to transform our company. We are realistic about the challenges in our industry, and proactively working to ensure our capabilities, cost structure and portfolio set us up for long-term success, which is reflected in our algorithm.","Thanks again for joining us today, and happy holidays, everyone. With that, I'll turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, and happy holidays to everyone. I'm going to touch on a number of topics this morning: first, I'll provide a brief overview of our new reporting segment structure; then I'll discuss our fiscal second quarter performance; next, I'll address comparability matters; then onto cash flow, balance sheet and capital items, including some added color on our approach to integration and restructuring; I will also provide some comments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2014; and finally, I will address the California lead paint lawsuit that has been in the news this week.","This quarter, we completed the transition to our new reporting segments. In connection with the acquisition and integration of Ralcorp, we have realigned all of our business units into 3 new operating segments: Consumer Foods, Commercial Foods and Private Brands. Let me quickly summarize the changes, which are also detailed on Page 7 of the release, starting with the new Consumer Foods segment. This segment includes substantially all of our consumer branded businesses. It also includes a small international business that was previously part of the Ralcorp Food Group segment. The new Commercial Foods segment includes the Lamb Weston, ConAgra Mills, Spicetec Flavors & Seasonings and J.M. Swank businesses and certain foodservice businesses previously included in the Consumer Foods and Ralcorp Frozen Bakery products segments. And the new Private Brands segment includes our consumer, private branded food previously included in the Ralcorp Food Group segment and the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery product segment, as well as the store brands business previously managed within the Consumer Foods segment. All prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the new segment structure.","Next, I'd like to share some comments on our second quarter performance. As Gary noted, overall, the fiscal second quarter results were better than we had anticipated, largely due to a stronger close to the quarter, primarily in our Consumer Foods segment. Specifically, volume trends strengthened considerably during the last month of the quarter due to a couple of factors. First, we have seen a stronger recovery in inventory levels at certain customers, which favorably impacted our shipments. And overall, we had very good holiday shipments this season, and more of them occurred in the second quarter this year due to customer plans and the compressed time frame between Thanksgiving and Christmas.","Overall, for the second quarter, we reported net sales of $4.7 billion, up 27%, driven primarily by Ralcorp, which was not included in the prior year sales due to the date of the acquisition. For the quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.54 versus $0.52 in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.62 versus $0.57 in the prior quarter -- prior year quarter, a 9% increase.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few points, starting with our new Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $2 billion, in line with the year-ago period, reflecting flat volumes and flat price\/mix, as well as a small contribution from the addition of Ralcorp international sales. Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $293 million or about 11% higher than the year-ago period. The operating profit improvement reflects the flat volumes, modest inflation and effective cost savings, as well as the benefit from lower marketing and SG&A costs. Marketing costs decreased about $19 million or about 15% from the prior year quarter. And the prior year quarter did reflect a significant level of investment. A portion of the decrease was successfully redeployed to support increased merchandising programs.","On foreign exchange, for this quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales and operating profit by approximately $12 million and $3 million, respectively. Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost-reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $50 million in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, we expect cost savings in this segment to be approximately $200 million. Approximately $30 million of additional savings will be reflected in other segments as a result of the new reporting structure. For the fiscal second quarter, we experienced inflation of about 2%.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.6 billion or 3% above the prior year quarter. The increase reflects the addition of foodservice business previously reported in the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery product segment. Due to the timing of the acquisition, this business is not reflected in the year-ago amounts. This increase was partially offset by the pass-through of lower wheat costs in our flour milling business.","The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, decreased 9% from the year-ago period to $178 million. The year-over-year decrease reflects the expected decline in our Lamb Weston business, partially offset by the contribution from the foodservice business included in the Ralcorp acquisition. Operating income from the other businesses in the segment, including flour milling, were about flat to the year-ago period.","Our Private Brands segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1.1 billion. And operating profit, excluding items impacting comparability, was approximately $91 million, slightly below our expectations. The operating profit results reflect volume softness across several categories, consistent with some of the trends we've seen across the broader consumer foods industry. And while we are making progress on our integration plans and we are bullish on the long-term top and bottom line growth opportunity in this segment, the timing of improvement in volume trends and from operations this fiscal year is behind our original plans.","Nonetheless, we remain on track to deliver approximately $0.25 per share of accretion for the full fiscal year from the Ralcorp acquisition. Also, we are making good progress on both COGS and SG&A synergy initiatives, and we are on track to achieve our synergy targets.","Moving on to corporate expenses. For the quarter, corporate expenses were $106 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $68 million versus $65 million in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year change reflects the addition of Ralcorp corporate expense, offset by lower base operating costs, including pension costs and incentives. The tax rate for this fiscal quarter was approximately 34%.","Now I'll move on to my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.08 per diluted share of expense in this quarter's reported diluted EPS from continuing operations related to several items. First, integration, acquisition-related restructuring and transaction costs, principally related to our acquisition of Ralcorp. In all, we recorded approximately $35 million or $0.05 per share of net expense related to these acquisition matters.","On hedging, for the fiscal second quarter, the net hedging expense included in corporate expenses was approximately $9 million or $0.01 per share. In addition, we recorded approximately $9 million or $0.01 per share related to an asset impairment in our Commercial Foods segment and approximately $3 million or $0.01 per share of expense related to the remeasurement of a pension liability at an international potato venture.","Next, I'll cover cash flow, balance sheet and capital items. First, we ended the quarter with $193 million of cash on hand and $230 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. For fiscal year 2014, we expect cash flows from operating activities to be in the range of $1.6 billion, including a modest contribution from working capital improvement.","On capital expenditures, for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $151 million versus $81 million in the prior year period. And for fiscal year 2014, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million.","Net interest expense was $95 million in the fiscal second quarter versus $53 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase is driven by the additional interest expense related to financing the Ralcorp transaction. Dividends for the quarter increased from $97 million in the year-ago quarter to $106 million due to the increase in shares outstanding.","On capital allocation, our priority over the next couple of years continues to be the repayment of debt, as well as strengthening our credit metrics. Consistent with that priority, we currently expect to repay approximately $600 million of debt in fiscal 2014 and a total of $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2015. These amounts exclude any additional repayment that we expect to fund from the cash proceeds related to the Ardent Mills transaction.","As previously noted, as we delever, we expect to maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share and limit our share repurchase plans. This quarter, we did repurchase approximately $69 million of shares, funded principally from the option exercise proceeds received over the last few quarters. And while we expect to limit M&A activity in the near term as we focus on deleveraging and integration, we will continue to consider opportunities to improve our portfolio. We will also continue to prudently invest behind innovation, production capacity and our cost-savings initiatives.","During the fiscal second quarter, we did complete 2 small transactions: first, we divested our Lightlife business, and the results for Lightlife for the fiscal second quarter and all prior periods are classified as discontinued operations; and second, we purchased certain dessert production assets from a former co-manufacturing partner primarily supporting our Marie Callender's dessert business. The net cash and earnings impact of these transactions is immaterial.","On the restructuring, we continue to develop our restructuring plans. While I don't yet have extensive financial details, I would like to address several aspects of these plans. First, on the scope of our plans. In connection with the Ralcorp acquisition, we have taken several actions to affect the integration and capture early synergies related to both cost of goods and SG&A. In addition to these initial integration efforts, we are also in the process of identifying opportunities to achieve sustainable reduction in supply chain and administrative costs across our entire enterprise to improve competitiveness and support investments in growth. These efforts will include a more holistic approach to manufacturing and distribution network optimization, as well as administrative efficiency and effectiveness. Given the scale and size of our company with the addition of Ralcorp, we believe we have significant opportunities to improve our competitiveness by looking beyond the initial scope of our integration plans.","And let me address a few financial aspects. First, to date, our Board of Directors has approved approximately $200 million of onetime restructuring costs, including about $45 million of noncash charges. These costs are principally related to the Ralcorp integration. As we expand the scope of the plan, we do expect to increase our estimates of onetime costs, both cash and noncash, that we expect to incur over the next several years. Second and most importantly, we expect to design our plans in a manner that will not materially impact our ability to repay debt or reinvest in the business. Overall, we are confident that, given our cash flow and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we can improve our competitiveness, as well as our balance sheet strength, over the next several years. We expect to provide more financial details on this broader scope once these details have been determined and approved, and we will provide a further update during our CAGNY presentation in February.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2014 full year outlook. We continue to expect that our full fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding items impacting comparability, will be in the range of $2.34 to $2.38. And we are still expecting a very strong second half of the year in terms of EPS growth. While the stronger performance in the second quarter will provide us some tailwind for the full year, our current outlook also reflects some of the challenges that Gary and I have referenced.","In summary, we are pleased with the results in the fiscal second quarter and the progress we've made after a slow start to the year, but we remain appropriately cautious about some of the short-term challenges we face over the balance of fiscal 2014. We continue to feel good about our long-term algorithm and our capital allocation goals and how the business is positioned to perform over the next few years after this year of transition.","Before I conclude and we open it up for questions, I would like to provide some comments on a matter that is unrelated to our current operations or performance. I know that some of you have seen the recent news about the California lead paint case and are probably wondering how and why our company is even mentioned, much less cited as part of a proposed $1.1 billion judgment that is joint and several with 2 other companies. First, let me say that we have never been in the paint business. We are named because of a company we bought in 1990, Beatrice, which had, about 25 years prior to our acquisition, sold a company that made paint. I don't offer that simply to demonstrate how ridiculous it is that we are a party but also because it will play a role in the legal appeals process. As you probably know, we've been involved in other state cases against paint companies. You can find disclosure about those cases in our public filings. It's important to note that, to date, we have been successful in every lawsuit in which we've been involved. With respect to this California case, we believe the wrong outcome has occurred, and we will appeal the decision. We will continue to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter because we simply do not believe that we inherited any of the liabilities of the paint company I previously mentioned. The assets of that entity were sold, and the entity itself was dissolved in 1968, long before we owned Beatrice. Importantly, we'll also be appealing on other substantive legal grounds, including the public nuisance theory itself. We know that this is a topic of interest to many of you and that it's complex. So instead of getting into more discussion on this call, I'll refer you to a website, www.leadlawsuits.com, which has a good amount of information about all the cases, as well as some thoughts on where the California court went wrong. As far as next steps, we expect that the appeals process is going to take several years to resolve. We have also notified our insurance carriers and would resort to our policies if ultimately necessary. That's all I'll say on this topic this morning, but we will keep you apprised of significant developments.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your time and interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I, along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two questions, if I can. First, Gary, about how much did the pull-forward of volume in the fiscal second quarter impact Consumer Foods volume and EPS? And the reason I ask is both to judge what 3Q volume could look like, and also get a sense if there's anything we can take away from this quarter's Consumer volume that helps us get more rather than less comfortable with the back half. And then I've just got a follow-up on Private Brands.","John F. Gehring","Yes, Andrew, I'm not sure -- in terms of exactly how much, I'm not sure we can really break it down that way. Clearly, there was some shift between Q3 and Q2, but I'm not sure we can cite a specific number. I would say that there is a portion that's a shift, and there is a portion that probably creates a little bit of tailwind to offset some of the issues later in the year.","Chris Klinefelter","And this is Chris. I'm sorry, I'll build and just say that, although we won't get into firm numbers, we were originally planning for Consumer Foods volumes to be down slightly, low single-digit rate, coming in flat, and that difference is attributable to all the things that Gary talked about in his remarks.","Gary M. Rodkin","Andrew, also, I just want to let everybody know my voice sounds a bit like a frog, it's because I've got a cold. So I'm glad that you're not here for me to spread it to you. But it really was a little bit of a pull forward. All it was, was we got it at the very end of Q2, instead of the very beginning of Q3, so that's about the extent of it.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So we want to make sure, obviously, we -- I'm assuming we keep that in mind, obviously, when we think about Consumer Foods volume in the third quarter just because the takeaway that we all see in scanner and whatnot is obviously still not where I think any of us would want it to be.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I would tell you on that, we will start to see that improve, and we'll -- and we believe that we'll see the consumption and the shipments pretty much merge over the second half.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then on Private Brands, assuming that the rest of the year plays out across the business as you expect, I still feel like the Private Brands piece is in a little bit of a black hole to investors, particularly given how the numbers have been reclassified this quarter. I guess, what are some of the specific benchmarks maybe we can look to or that you can provide for us maybe over the next 2 quarters on this business to provide the visibility that the cost synergies that you're looking for in fiscal '15 can actually flow through to give you the kind of 10% earnings growth you're looking for, maybe rather than needed -- being needed to shore up the business again? So I guess, basically, how will we know that fiscal '15 is not going to be another transition year for Ralcorp like '14 was?","John F. Gehring","Yes, let me try to take a shot at that, Andrew. I think the key is, certainly, as we get into FY '15 and we lay out the year and our plans for the year, I think, given the fact that, at that point, we'll have solid prior year reference points, we'll be able to lay out the various components of the earnings growth, I think by segment, as we put that plan together. Admittedly, it is a little challenging. It's even a little bit challenging internally without the prior year lapse over the next couple of quarters. So I think one of the things you'll have to rely on is some of our estimates on the synergies that are flowing through. And certainly, I think as we get to CAGNY, I think that will be another opportunity for us to provide a little more color on some of the drivers of the business and, certainly, how we're doing on the synergies and the sources of those.","Operator","And we'll move now to David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Gary, I think I got that same frog in the throat, so I apologize for my horrible voice. Just wanted to dive a little bit more into the retail environment and kind of the thought process here on what you're seeing. When you look at the brand segmentation, can you give us a little bit more color on kind of where you really expect to see the pickup in your plans as you change the pricing architecture? The portfolio is very large at this point, so I think it would be helpful for us to kind of be able to track -- going to Andrew's question, to track against the takeaway data that we see from Nielsen. Is it about frozen? Is it about center-of-the-store dry goods? How do you see the different components here moving as the year progresses?","Thomas M. McGough","David, this is Tom McGough, and let me answer that in 2 parts. First, generally about our entire portfolio. During Q2, our consumption performance improved as the quarter progressed. We had a very good Thanksgiving period, and our consumption grew over the last month. What we're really pleased about is that we executed our merchandising programs that we talked about in Q1 in a very disciplined way. Our price\/mix was flat, and we held our gross margin for the quarter. As you noted, given the breadth of our portfolio, we look at our performance in a couple different segments. Businesses like Hunt's and Ro*Tel Tomatoes, Reddi-wip, portions of the Marie Callender and Banquet business, particularly in our pot pies, and Slim Jim, these are businesses that continue to grow and continue to build share. We're investing to grow on these businesses. Our consumer and customer programs are delivering very good results, and we would anticipate that we would sustain that level of performance going forward. The brands like Banquet, Hebrew National, Wesson, Peter Pan, we've tactically adjusted our merchandising programs based on the category and customer -- or competitive dynamics. We're holding and, in some instance, building share there, and we're very pleased with the performance. But there are some brands and categories that are particularly challenging. We've talked about Chef Boyardee, Healthy Choice, microwave popcorn. We're making progress on getting the fundamentals right on those businesses, but it's going to take time to see the impact. And we anticipate continued weaknesses in those areas. But as I started, overall, we're pleased with the disciplined approach that we've taken to pricing and merchandising, and we're pleased with the performance where we're investing the most resources.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Terrific answer. Just one follow-up on that. Do you think that the competitive environment on pricing and promotions, does it remain disciplined and rational as you might hope?","Thomas M. McGough","Yes, it is. We are making tactical adjustments. We believe we're striking the right balance, as indicated by our price\/mix.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, we don't see dramatic change.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Bank of America's Bryan Spillane.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the Private Brands segment. In the context that the volume growth or volumes are pacing a little bit behind plan, Gary, can you talk a little bit about how much of that is a function of -- you've gone through a period where there was a gap in service levels, so just the function of just simply no one there to take an order? And also, can you talk a bit about where you stand today in terms of the progress you've made talking to retailers about the value add that you bring, particularly in terms of the types of products that you can now produce on this new platform?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, absolutely. Let me start, and then I'll turn it over to Paul Maass for a little bit more color. Again, Bryan, we remain very confident in the strategy. Value is here to stay, and Private Brands will most certainly be a long-term growth factor in the industry. We can -- we really continue to see good traction on cost synergies. And as you mentioned, innovation initiatives with some major customers, that will take some time to cycle in, but real good progress there. And I'd also say our new Private Brands organization is really just getting grounded. Now you do know, as you referenced, there were some issues from Ralcorp's own restructuring that are taking a bit longer to get fixed. I'd say 2 key buckets to mention: customer service levels and pricing. Several of the Ralcorp plant consolidation projects that were underway prior to our ownership had some, I'd say, planning and execution gaps, and they've taken longer to get on track than expected but we're now making progress. And on the pricing architecture, that cost us -- cost the business some bps before our ownership and during the early transition months. But fortunately, most of these issues are now finally behind us. It does take some time, as I said, to affect performance change in a market. But net-net, we're probably about 6 months behind where we had hoped to be but just as positive and enthusiastic.","Paul T. Maass","Yes, what I would add is just it is -- it requires intense focus. That's why we organized the way we have. The execution is unique customer-by-customer, category-by-category, really, SKU-by-SKU, in getting the pricing right at the shelf and getting our execution, the service levels right, and it's why we've organize the way we have to really intensify our focus. And I agree with what Gary said on the timing.","Operator","And we'll move now to Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Gary, I wanted to follow up on the answer to the previous question. On the structural changes we talked about on the last call with Ralcorp, I mean, it seems like you maybe had to undo or redo some of the changes they made as far as the holding company, supervisory and maybe some personnel changes. Like where are you in that actual sort of personnel level and implementation process with Ralcorp? And I just have one other detail question after that.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Jonathan, I'd say we are now feeling pretty good. We have the sales organization, the sales teams in place. We now have 6 distinct business units for more focus, and they each have general managers from old -- or I should say from legacy ConAgra, from Ralcorp and several from the outside. So that structure has now been in place for several months. Leadership is really important here. We've got that in place, and it's just going to take a little bit of time to start to affect the change in the marketplace. As Paul referenced, this business is very granular customer-by-customer, category-by-category, but we're in a much better place than we were a few months ago.","Paul T. Maass","And just one of the benefits of being part of a large ConAgra Foods organization, we're leveraging our supply chain expertise to get that service back on track where it belongs. And we focused on that. We're -- we've made huge steps on that. So we're leveraging the entire organization to really advance things.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Great. And I apologize if I missed a comment about this in the opening remarks. But the -- for -- when the Ardent Mills transaction eventually closes, have you talked about what you're going to do with the proceeds?","John F. Gehring","Yes, Jonathan, this is John Gehring. Our plan at this point is we will use those proceeds to accelerate our debt repayment.","Operator","And we have a question now from Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","First question I have for you was, one of your competitors yesterday pointed out the shift in Thanksgiving, how it impacted their business, have you seen any impact from that?","Gary M. Rodkin","We planned for Thanksgiving, when Thanksgiving was going to land. Thilo, as we said, we got some of the merchandising for the holidays a bit earlier than we had expected, and that's why we had a bit of a shift from early Q3 into Q2. But I would say that's about the extent of it.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then when I look at your scanner data and I look at how you've increased promotions, that you don't seem to get as much of a lift from the promotions as I would have expected. I think you've called out a brand, like Chef Boyardee, that hasn't really reacted to it yet. What does it say about a brand like Chef Boyardee? It didn't seem to react to marketing, it doesn't seem to react to promotions. What does it say about the long-term viability for that brand?","Thomas M. McGough","Sure. This is Tom. In Chef Boyardee, we lead in the canned pasta, but we really compete in a much broader competitive set with many other quick, easy-to-prepare meals. The reality is, when you look at that broader competitive set, we see much stronger competitive activity across the board. As you mentioned, this is a brand that's been very successful with multiple price -- multiple purchase promotions. From a consumer standpoint, there are fewer of those traditional stock-up trips as consumers are shopping more toward their immediate consumption. And as a result, the sell-through on our promotions had been less than what we've seen historically. And I think that's generally happening in many categories, not just Chef Boyardee. Without disclosing too much information from a competitive standpoint, we are retooling our go-to-market approach, both in terms of our marketing and merchandising. We're making very good progress on that. But it will take time to have market impact. It will have time to take market impact on that business.","Operator","And Jason English with Goldman Sachs has our next question.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I want to ask about this restructuring program that you hinted at. Are you looking at this as an opportunity to sort of keep your productivity pipeline full, so this roughly $240 million or so of annualized COGS productivity. Is this just more fuel to keep that going? Or is this over and above what you usually target?","John F. Gehring","I'd say a little bit of both, Jason. I think, certainly, some of the restructuring, as we look at network and distribution, the network optimization, I do think some of that is going to support our ability to continue to deliver good results there. Certainly, we're always looking, as part of that, to see if we can add some extra fuel to that fire, if you will. But I think the other element that we're taking a real hard look at and working on as we speak is, given the size of the organization, what can we do, from an administrative cost efficiency and effectiveness standpoint, to further leverage the size of the organization and the scale of the organization to be more efficient on that end of things too. So I'd say it's both manufacturing and distribution network optimization, some of which is needed to sustain the pipeline and, perhaps, improve it. The other piece would be the administrative effectiveness.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I'm here to hear more. And then more tactically, specifically, just this last quarter, within Consumer Foods, you mentioned that gross margins were comparable to prior year. Can you enlighten us in terms of the productivity that you realized this quarter within Consumer Foods and so the pacing for the year, as well as inflation?","John F. Gehring","Yes. So, Jason, we've talked about $50 million of cost savings in the Consumer segment this year, and we...","Gary M. Rodkin","This quarter.","John F. Gehring","I'm sorry, this quarter, $50 million this quarter. We expect $200 million of cost savings to fall into the Consumer Foods -- the new Consumer Foods segment this whole year. And as I mentioned, there will be about $30 million of additional cost savings that will be reflected in the other segments because of the moves of some of the businesses where those benefits fall.","Operator","We'll move now to Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask about your longer-term or medium-term EPS growth outlook of 10%. Can you help us in -- with that guidance in the context of this new segment reporting, there's a lot of moving parts. But at the operating profit level, I'm assuming you're going to have similar type growth, maybe high-single digits. Can you give us a sense as to which segments will perform above or below that in your projections over the next couple of years?","John F. Gehring","Yes, Akshay, I don't think we're positioned today to talk about earnings growth by segments. What I would -- as we certainly get into next year, we'll provide more discussion about that, and we'll talk about our algorithm more at CAGNY. What I would offer, if you just stand back, we've got a lot of confidence that our base business, as it exists today, can deliver reasonable operating profit growth, call it, in the mid-single digits. And then when you look at the opportunity we have from the synergy opportunities ahead of us, that's really what's going to take you from what would be a normalized maybe mid-single digits up into that 10% range. And again, unfortunately, at this time, we're not prepared to talk segment-by-segment.","Chris Klinefelter","All right. This is Chris. I'll build on John's remarks and just say that keep in mind, as John indicated in his prepared remarks, that these synergies aren't necessarily going to fall to just one segment. So that's another reason that's complicating it right now. So we'll be getting back to you with more details later.","Operator","And we have a question now from David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. You mentioned how you adjusted promotions in -- to be more competitive in a few categories. We have Thanksgiving noise in our Nielsen numbers, so it's difficult to see the progress that you described earlier. You seem to think that consumer trends, the consumption had improved through the quarter. And what I'm looking at, it's down 5% for the last 12 weeks. And the comparisons seem to be getting tougher through May. So I'm -- I just wanted to probe a little bit, what exactly are you seeing, perhaps, some adjusted consumption numbers, that are making you feel more hopeful? And how should we think about the tougher comparisons and your ability to lap those over the next couple quarters?","Thomas M. McGough","Sure, David. This is Tom McGough. What I was referencing is our consumption -- our most recent consumption performance over the last 4 to 6 weeks. We certainly have a view of the entire holiday season, including the shift in Thanksgiving. Our consumption grew over that period of time. That was indicative of very strong holiday promotions on businesses like Reddi-wip, Marie Callender pies, but also incremental merchandising programs that we've secured at key customers in key categories. The Banquet frozen meals, for example, is growing very nicely. We're seeing the same on Marie Callender. We anticipate that many of the merchandising changes that we made began to have their most impact beginning in November, and we continue to see -- we anticipate we're going to continue to see the results of that in the upcoming quarter.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. And, David, I think you'll see a little gap between pricing and volume. And that's really because of some of the very commodity-oriented products, like Wesson oil or Peter Pan Peanut Butter, where the commodities have come down and the pricing has come down. And you've seen that from some other companies. So there may be a little bit of a gap there, but Tom is really referencing the volume.","Thomas M. McGough","Yes, so that's a very good point. And I'll just close by saying we're taking a very disciplined, surgical approach. We see that in our price\/mix, our margin performance. We believe we're striking the right balance in that equation.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Deutsche Bank's Eric Katzman.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess, 2 or 3 questions. First, maybe I'm just missing this, but your annual guidance on an operating adjusted basis, that included the dilution from the mills -- the milling divestiture. And so does the timing slippage on that, does that now include some earnings that wouldn't have been otherwise in your guidance?","John F. Gehring","Yes, Eric, let me take that. This is John. I think there are a number of variables in the dilution calculations, the Ardent Mills transaction. Timing is one of them. We continue to monitor those various variables. I'd say that the shift in timing has had a minor impact. But at this point, I would say that $0.03 of dilution is still the best estimate of what the impact is going to be this year.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess that's within the range, so that's -- that doesn't really have much of an impact for the full year, for the fiscal year?","John F. Gehring","Yes, that's correct. Yes, the shift in timing, it really has an impact in our overall estimates.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Gary, the shift to -- or the segmentation, as part of the Ralcorp changes, to 6 segments, do those 6 product lines, I assume those represent the vast bulk of the Ralcorp business. And so -- but if not, is there a certain, let's say, tail there that you just don't feel is worth keeping? And would that -- is that something that we should think about as a lag or a pressure on reported Ralcorp sales going forward?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Eric, I'd say that it's basically just the way that we've divvied up the portfolio between the Ralcorp businesses and the legacy ConAgra Foods businesses, just to make sure that we have enough focus on each category. So for instance, there's a cereal category and there's a category for condiments, and there's 6 like that. So there's nothing else to take from that other than that we wanted to make sure we had enough focus on each one of those categories because it's a broad portfolio.","John F. Gehring","And just a mechanical clarification, just so everybody's clear, to recall, as we move the segments around, there's a portion of the Ralcorp Frozen Bakery products legacy segment that is in our Commercial segment because it's a foodservice business. And then there are some international sales that are now sitting in our new Consumer Foods segment. So you've got -- the sum of the pieces have moved around across all the segments. But in terms of the focus on the 6 within Private Brands, that's -- Gary's answer covers that.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, if I could. The -- so you touched on this before, but -- so you've got the -- like the kind of the annualized goal of $250 million or so of synergy -- or productivity, sorry, from the Consumer division historically. And that's now going to be distributed a little bit slightly differently because of the change in the segments. And then on top of that, you've got the Ralcorp synergies, and those are also now going to be distributed across the organization, but I would assume that -- is it reasonable to assume that the bulk of those are still going to be in the Private Brands segment?","John F. Gehring","Yes, I think that's a pretty fair characterization. Most of them will be there. And to your earlier point, we talked about -- at the outset of this year, within the legacy Consumer Foods segment, we talked about $230 million of cost savings. We feel like we're tracking on that number, but about $200 million will show up in the new Consumer Foods segment, and the other $30 million will follow the businesses that went into Private Brands or to our Commercial business.","Operator","And we'll hear a question now from Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I ask a question about category growth? If you look at categories like canned pasta, we seem to have seen some fairly steady declines in the volume growth over the past several years. I just wanted to ask whether that -- in your view, is that driven by consumers changing attitude towards packaged foods -- certain packaged food segments, maybe shifting away from more heavily processed foods into healthier, fresher and simpler products? Or is there something else going on? And if there is a shift in consumer attitude, how do you respond to that? That's the first question. And a quick follow-up. On the trans fat ban, how burdensome would this be for you to eliminate?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I'll take the second one first, Alexia. On trans fats, we've eliminated most of that from our portfolio over the last, I don't know, 5 or 6 years. There, clearly, are still some products that have some level of trans fats. It's really going to come down to exactly what the regulations dictate, but we're continuing to work on that. And I would say it is not a material issue for us. And then -- and we, obviously, also have to do that on Private Brands as well. The question on categories, clearly, we've got a big, broad portfolio. Some are more challenged than others. You hit on one that is more challenged, and I would say we're not expecting big growth from canned pasta. That's just not realistic. But there are other categories, many other categories, that we plan where we will deploy resources in a bigger way. Clearly, there's tailwinds in a category like snacks, where we're quite big, particularly now with Ralcorp, with cookies, crackers, nuts, et cetera. So we've got somewhat of a mixed bag across our big, broad portfolio, and that's how we're going to allocate our resources.","Operator","And we'll move now to Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I think one of the concerns I hear from investors is that merchandising effectiveness has gotten tougher and tougher because it's like pushing against a string. The consumer isn't responding, especially low-income consumers, to the value offerings that are being put in front of them. But your comments today are very much different from that. I just want to know, like are you more hopeful for next year that you figured out the right tactics, the right formulas, price points for merchandising price points and promotional price points?","Thomas M. McGough","Sure, Robert. When you talk about our portfolio, it is a broad portfolio, and we like to assess the performance based on -- we like to segment the performance. We see very good sales growth, share growth in many of our categories where we continue to invest. Hunt's and Ro*Tel Tomatoes is one that I highlighted, Reddi-wip. This is where we've got a great consumer message. We're investing in A&P. We're getting great retailer support. That's converting into organic share and volume growth. But the challenge that you highlighted around the value consumer is indicative of the change in that stock-up trip, we're looking at different ways to satisfy that consumer. And one, in particular, is pot pies. It's a tremendous value, and we're seeing very, very strong merchandising support, customer engagement in that category in growth. So in general, it's a tough economic environment for consumers. But clearly, there are areas that we are growing.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. And again, Robert, I would just say it is really the value of our total portfolio. And we have to shift the resources to where we can drive business. Tom alluded to the pot pie, that's a great example. We have to fish where the fish are, and we're going to continue to adjust in that fashion.","Operator","And we have a question now from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions, if I could. I think -- my first one is in relation to Consumer Foods, the Consumer Foods division. And I think, from Tom's response, we can infer this, but I want to be clear, that you've been very tactical with your promotional spending. And should we expect, therefore, that it gets even more -- do you get any more promotional in Q3 and Q4, the second half of the year? Would that promotional line even accelerate a bit sequentially as you get these programs in place? And the second question was related to the historical Ralcorp business. And you have been talking about $4 billion in sales, and I was curious if that was still an appropriate number if some of the recent -- just the weakness you've had in private label overall, if that's challenged that figure at all as it comes through the second half -- in the second half and for the full year.","Thomas M. McGough","Sure, let me start -- this is Tom. Let me start with the first question. Our execution in Q2 is what we would expect in Q3 and Q4 in terms of maintaining a strong discipline, in terms of our spending, we want to be very surgical and tactical and execute in a very disciplined way. I don't see a material change in our approach for the balance of the year. I would anticipate something very similar to what we just achieved.","Gary M. Rodkin","And on Ralcorp, I would tell you that I wish that I saw more immediate impact on the top line performance. But I have to tell you, I'm trying to be more patient because we've only had our new general managers and sales teams in place for a few months. They are digging out of a hole. They are building new relationships with customers. And I can see them making progress every day. And you know a big transformation like this is really hard work. The important thing is to see that progress every day. So I am very confident we're going to start to turn the corner in the next 4 to 6 months because the strategy is sound and the execution is catching up.","John F. Gehring","Yes. And, Chris, on that point of your question, specifically, certainly as we revised the number down to $4 billion a couple of months ago, it's because we're starting to see some of these -- some of the timing issues, and the challenge to turn this around. But as we sit here today and we look across all 3 of our segments, where the Ralcorp -- legacy Ralcorp sales will fall, we think $4 billion is still a pretty good estimate of the total sales of the legacy business. So I think we're still on track there.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Ania Aldrich with Cambiar Investors.","Anna A. Aldrich - Cambiar Investors, LLC","It's Anna Aldrich. I wanted to ask you if you guys could comment how you think the ongoing reduction in food stamps is impacting your sales.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. The economy is still very tough for the vast majority of Americans, this whole Wall Street, Main Street gap. And any reduction in SNAP is going to make it tougher for a lot of families that are struggling. And we have been very proactive in working with retailers to help them adjust to their -- to these new shopping patterns, given the SNAP issue. And we believe, importantly, that our portfolio delivers the best overall value in the industry. So yes, it is clearly an issue. We think we're being very proactive to tackle it.","Anna A. Aldrich - Cambiar Investors, LLC","But there is no particular number you can put on it?","Gary M. Rodkin","No. I couldn't really quantify that.","Operator","And there are no further questions. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. And just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web, as detailed in our news release. And as always, we are available for discussions.

This program is being recorded. My name is Jessica Morgan, and I'll be your conference facilitator. All audience lines are currently in a listen-only mode, however our speakers will address your questions at the end of the presentation during the formal question-and-answer session.","At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I am Gary Rodkin and I am here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, our VP of Investor Relations. Before we get started, Chris has a few words.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve. So if you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that can influence and affect our business perhaps materially, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which includes cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the Q&A or on our web site.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary Rodkin","Thanks Chris. As we shared in our pre-announcement last week, fourth quarter diluted EPS from continuing operations on a comparable basis was $0.55 versus $0.60 a year ago, and as reported EPS showed a loss due to impairment charges, which we will talk about in a few minutes.","Our shortfall to our expectations was driven by two key factors; one, weaker than planned Consumer Foods volumes, and two, significantly lower profitability in our Private Brands operations.","As we reevaluated the current and near term profit trends for our private brands business, we concluded that we will be below original estimates for several years, which is the main reason we lowered our EPS outlook for fiscal 2015 to 2017.","To state the obvious, we are disappointed with these results. We didn't live up to our expectations, and the year and the quarter were unacceptable. In my book, there are no excuses for that.","I want to take the time this morning to explain the root causes of the miss and some details on the improvement initiatives underway. There is nothing more important for me than ensuring we drive improvement in fiscal 2015.","We have a tremendous amount of company-wide engagement, resources and energy devoted to improving results in fiscal 2015 and beyond. While fiscal 2014 was not what we wanted in terms of profits, our operating cash flow exceeded $1.5 billion, and we repaid $600 million of debt, both of these items exceeded expectations, and are important factors in the ability for us to succeed going forward.","We did this while continuing to pay a strong dividend, and I will emphasize that we remain committed to the current $1 per share annual payout, and a strong dividend policy as well.","At a segment level, we will start with our Consumer Foods results. Net sales were approximately $1.8 billion and operating profit was $177 million as reported. That reflects a sales decline of 7%, comprised of a 7% volume decline, 1% favorable price mix, and 1% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.","In Q4, our Consumer Foods volume decline was worse than the 3% to 4% decline we were expecting. Why? The continuing poor performance of several large brands we have discussed previously, very soft packaged food industry performance in May, and some late shifting of promotion timing into the first quarter of F 2015. As has been the case for a few quarters now, the biggest portion of our volume decline relates to a handful of brands that we have talked about before, namely Healthy Choice, Orville Redenbacher's and Chef Boyardee. We have begun making changes with these brands to improve performance. We are confident we are doing the right things to make an impact, and we recognize the need to move faster. We believe we will see better overall performance on the top and bottom line from this trio in fiscal 2015.","One of the softest categories is Healthy Meals, which obviously impacts Healthy Choice. The Frozen Healthy Meal segment is a big important area within frozen single serve meals at $2.5 billion in annual retail sales, comparable to the hot dog category. This particular part of frozen single serve meals has seen the biggest drop in sales. There is plenty of room for better performance in a category this big by gaining share via differentiated product.","In terms of specific initiatives, we have started improving product mix, meaning moving to more of our proprietary Cafe Steamers offerings and discontinuing a number of other Healthy Choice slow moving SKUs. Those discontinuations are contributing to the brand\u2019s current volume declines, and that will continue in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, but better volume performance should start to show in the second quarter.","For context, Cafe Steamers is a truly differentiated product line, has proven staying power, and has good margins. So growing that specific product line is good all around for our results.","Moving on to Chef Boyardee, we had eliminated at the beginning of fiscal 2014, the Easy Open lid on Chef Boyardee cans and in retrospect this was a mistake. So we have very recently added it back, and that inventory is now getting on shelf. We strongly believe Chef Boyardee can do a better job with core category users by leveraging its protein content about 16 grams in a can that costs on average, about $1.","In addition, we have retooled our merchandising programs customer by customer to get more lift with a renewed focus on the core user. We are seeing good growth in Chef Boyardee microwave cups, so we believe the Chef equity still has strength, and are looking forward to leveraging that.","In regard to Orville Redenbacher's, our strategy over the past several years has been to grow overall microwave popcorn usage and we lost share as competitors did a better job executing in-store. We have shifted our focus to be more competitive and to be more perfect at retail. This is a work in progress, but we believe the strategy shift will improve our performance.","While overall volume in Consumer Foods was disappointing, we had good sales performances from some brands within the portfolio, including for Totally Frozen meals, Slim Jim Meat Snacks and Reddi-wip, all of which continued to respond well to our marketing spend.","In the overall Frozen category, consumer buying is down, but we are taking share in single served meals. We continue to be a strong player there overall, and we saw good share performance as well as volume growth during the quarter, from Marie Callender's and Bertolli.","Of course, the volume declines have weighed on profits in Consumer Foods. For the fourth quarter, adjusted operating profit of $268 million was 3% below the comparable $275 million last year. The impact of the volume decline on profit was lessened by cost savings in excess of inflation, as well as lower advertising and promotion expenses.","Looking ahead, we do have confidence in stabilizing Consumer Foods volume, getting sequentially better in fiscal 2015 for three reasons; one, we expect to see gradual improvement in those three bigger brands that have weighed on volume; drew the specific plans we have in place for each of them. Two; we are well positioned to grow and build share in faster growing customer channels, where there is significant opportunity for us.","We have been underdeveloped here in simply capturing our fair share of these faster growing retail outlets, specifically Club, Dollar and C-Store will provide a meaningful boost; and as we shared with you at CAGNY, we are actively innovating and designing products, packaging and promotional strategies to be a bigger part of that channel growth. We have shifted R&D and supply chain resources to ensure that we have the right focus on channels, and are already seeing some success with brands like Bertolli in the club channel.","And third, we see upside coming from our international Consumer Foods business, while still a small part of our portfolio, we can see it starting to make a difference in our overall results as our global customers grow around the world. Many of our brands do well in emerging markets, particularly in Latin America, Mexico and India. Our focus is specific by geography and product platform to capture growth in products like tomatoes, popcorn and hot cocoa.","We have rewired our organization to get sharper and faster in our execution. We have significantly intensified our focus on customers with stronger joint business planning, we are fine tuning our promotions to reconnect with loyal consumers more effectively, and we are continuing to drive supply chain productivity.","When we think about other efficiencies, specifically trade and marketing spend, we have realistic expectations about growth in this segment, given our center of store categories and product lines. We balance our trade and marketing investment with all this in mind, so that we are structuring our spending for an appropriate return. We do have a number of strong brands with effective advertising. We now have a more laser-like focus on the true effectiveness and impact of our marketing and trade spend, and we will continue to fine tune for maximum impact.","In summary on Consumer Foods, we believe the plans we have got in place will drive better top and bottom line performance in fiscal 2015.","Now I will move on to our Private Brands segment, where sales were approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with prior year amounts. Profits for the Private Brands were soft at about $60 million below comparable year ago amounts.","We made significant pricing concessions in the previous nine to 12 months that combined to drive down margins. Those were significant investments we chose to put into this business to stabilize customer relationships and preserve a sales base, as we work through some customer service and manufacturing issues inherited from the legacy Ralcorp business. Those were our issues, not broad, private brand industry challenges.","It's also worth noting that some of the quarter's operating profit decline came from what I will call concentrated costs, as we made a handful of integration changes and other transitions. We have begun the closure of three plants as part of our network optimization plan. We have made significant distribution center changes and we have created new supplier arrangements. While there is costs associated with these moves, they create longer term value. In other words, this quarter had some costs that progressively lessened throughout fiscal 2015.","Looking ahead, we expect profit to improve in this segment in fiscal 2015. We will lap most of the 2014 pricing concessions in the back half of fiscal 2015. We have corrected the service issues. We are regaining customer confidence and we are beginning to win new business with the opportunity to win more business with better pricing and an improved mix. We will also benefit from a more efficient organization.","We believe margins will improve starting in the second half of fiscal 2015, as we lap our pricing and accelerate our cost synergies. Let me be clear, the profit headwinds and these specific integration issues that we have been discussing for a while now, are not a result of owning both a branded and private label business. The issues reflect the fact that we brought a roll-up company that was beginning a restructuring, and that company was made up of many parts that weren't functioning together and needed fixing. We knew there would be work to do, but underestimated the degree of difficulty and the amount of time it would take to course correct.","We have paid lots of tuition in terms of learnings. Frankly, we have been back on our heels reacting, and are now in the very early stages of leveraging our strengths proactively.","We are turning this business into one that operates more effectively, and has a better more sustainable marketplace footing. This will be well worth it, as we look out a few years.","We made a bold transformational move in acquiring Ralcorp, rooted in our continuing strong belief in our Private Brand strategy. It has been an intense learning experience, but in the end, the insights we have gained will make us better and stronger over time. Rebuilding customer trust and confidence required some difficult investment choices and trade-offs. A higher level of customer responsiveness required significant organizational rewiring. We are confident in long term growth opportunities for the Private Brands segment. We are confident that our investments designed to create healthy customer relationships, and preserve a substantial portion of our sales base, will serve us well for the long term.","That said, the profit performance for this segment over the next several years will not be as strong as we originally expected. That impacts our overall EPS commitments as we indicated in last week's preannouncement, but we are committed to getting back on track and accelerating growth in fiscal 2016 and beyond with productivity, synergies and organic business expansion.","Regarding synergies, we are comfortable with our original goals, we still should generate $300 million by fiscal 2017 from the Ralcorp transaction and we have taken that into consideration in our revised outlook. We are confident that we will gradually improve mix, see margin expansion and spend less money and time on course correcting.","Within our Commercial Foods segment, our fourth quarter sales and operating profits were up slightly. In Lamb Weston, which is the biggest part of our Commercial Foods business, we are dealing with a suboptimal potato crop, but have quickly recovered volume that we had lost earlier in fiscal 2014 due to a customer transition. In addition, we are gaining even more momentum internationally. In fact, Lamb Weston's international sales grew at a double digit rate in the fiscal year, as we capitalize on the international expansion of key customers.","While we continue to deal with last year's potato crop, we will continue to deal with last year's potato crop for a few months of fiscal 2015 we expect to have a very good year in our Commercial Foods business.","In our Milling business, sales declined in Q4, reflecting the pass-through of lower wheat costs and the profits declined due to market conditions. Shortly after the quarter ended, we completed the Ardent Mills transaction. The Ardent Mills JV will allow us to take part in financial gains of a more efficient milling business, without the sales volatility of a commodity oriented business in our base results. I am very confident that this will be a long term strategic win that will enhance ConAgra Foods' shareholder value over time.","As a reminder, we have a 44% interest in Ardent Mills. Long term, we expect good accretion from this important portfolio move, making this a financially and strategically sound transaction.","Looking ahead, we are basing our confidence in recovering in fiscal 2015 and growing beyond that on a number of well grounded factors. One of those is our cost reduction work that we are doing across the company. As we told you in February, we have committed to saving $100 million in SG&A costs by the end of fiscal 2016, and we are projecting to be ahead of schedule in fiscal 2015. These savings are in addition to our strong productivity and synergies which we have talked to you about before.","The SG&A savings come from what we call our effectiveness and efficiency work. The purpose is to create an organization that's more agile in its decision making and execution, extremely customer focused and more effective in resource allocation. When we became a bigger company with the acquisition of Ralcorp in fiscal 2013, we needed to take a hard look at how our resources were allocated and designed organizations and processes that more effectively and efficiently met the needs of customers. So this is about overall workflow and how we go to market in a way that best leverages our resources and speeds decision-making with the customer as our focal point across the organization. We have designed more effective and efficient ways to operate, leveraging our standards of expertise which are designed to scale across the company.","As an example, we have brought together our supply chains from across the company, as well as our research, quality and innovation team under one leader, Al Bolles. We have done this for end to end alignment with better linkage across our operations. Creating one seamless technical organization allows us to move faster, cut through obstacles, make better holistic decisions and win more with our customers.","In another leadership change, we wanted to let you know that Doug Knudsen who led our sales team for many years has retired. Many of you knew Doug from CAGNY and other events. We thank Doug for his tireless work and commitment, he was a key contributor to the company for 37 years and we wish him well in his retirement.","Taking over from Doug is Derek Delamater, our new President of Sales for our Retail Selling organization. We are excited about the capabilities Derek brings to the role. He has spent many years in the field representing ConAgra foods with some of our biggest customers, and was most recently inside our headquarters, fine tuning our analytics, and designing improvements on our joint business planning processes. He knows the current state of the marketplace first hand, and will help us build even more winning partnerships with customers, as we go forward.","The SG&A savings and better organizational design across the company are foundational to our year of rebuilding, and an important source of confidence in our EPS outlook. But they are not the only reason we are confident in our growth projections for fiscal 2015. In addition, we expect to have significant ongoing cost synergies from the Ralcorp acquisition, a strong commercial business led by growth from Lamb Weston, as we lap the food service customer loss, plus continuation of the good international growth, and a transition to a more normalized crop.","Private Brands volume growth, and the beginning of margin expansion in the second half of fiscal 2015, due to numerous improvements underway, and stabilization of the big consumer foods brands that have weighed on results, plus a sharper focus on growing channels and international markets.","We are confident these factors will continue to benefit results in fiscal 2016 and 2017 where we plan for EPS growth acceleration due to the foundational work we are doing now. And of course, will continue our debt reduction progress, all while keeping our commitment to a strong dividend currently at $1 per share annually.","In closing, we are using what we learned in fiscal 2014 to make headway. Establishing specific milestones for improvement and stabilizing the business in fiscal 2015. We are confident in our ability to make progress due to the factors we have mapped out and have shared with you this morning.","John will share additional details now, but before I turn it over to him, I want to thank you for your time and attention this morning. We are working hard to be transparent, provide the level of detail needed to ensure you have a good understanding of our results and plans.","Now I will turn it over to John.","John Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning everyone. I am going to touch on five topics this morning. First, I will start with a brief discussion of the intangible asset impairment charges we recorded this fiscal quarter. Then I will address fiscal fourth quarter and full year performance. Next, I will cover comparability matters, and then on to cash flow, capital and balance sheet items, and finally, I will provide some comments on our outlook.","Let's start with our intangible asset impairment charges; in our Private Brands segment, as a result of the continued decline in our gross margins through the second half of the fiscal year, and more modest expectations relative to the timing of improvement in profit margins, as reflected in our recently completed fiscal year 2015 plans, our fourth quarter impairment analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired. We then performed additional analysis to measure the impairment, and as a result, the company recorded non-cash impairment charges of approximately $605 million or $1.35 per share after tax.","This charge is principally related to the impairment of goodwill, but also includes some immaterial impairment charges related to certain brand or trademark assets in the Private Brands segment.","We also recorded additional non-cash charges of approximately $76 million or $0.12 per share after tax, principally related to the impairment of the Chef Boyardee brand in our Consumer Foods segment. This impairment reflects the impact of lower volume and margin trends for this brand. The total impairment charge of $681 million or $1.47 per share after tax is being treated as an item impacting comparability. The company believes that these non-cash charges will not impact the company's ability or plans to execute these businesses in the future.","Next, I'd like to comment on our performance. Overall, the fiscal fourth quarter and full year results were below our expectations and reflect continued challenges in several areas of our business. First, for the full fiscal year, we have reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.70 versus $1.85 last year. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share were $2.17 versus $2.16 in the prior fiscal year.","Turning to our fourth quarter results; for the fiscal fourth quarter, we reported net sales of $4.4 billion, down approximately 3%, driven by volume softness in our Consumer Foods segment, and the impact of lower year-over-year weak prices in our flour milling operations, offset somewhat by stronger volume in Lamb Weston.","For the quarter, we reported a loss per share from continuing operations of $0.76 versus earnings per share of $0.45 in the year ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share were $0.55, versus $0.60 in the prior year quarter, an 8% decrease.","While Gary has addressed our segment results, I would also like to touch on a few items; starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales were approximately $1.8 billion, down about 7% from the year ago period, reflecting a volume decline of 7%, positive price mix of about 1%, and about 1% of negative FX.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $268 million or down about 3% from a year ago period. The operating profit decline reflects the weak volume performance, largely offset by lower marketing and SG&A costs, including incentive compensation.","The impact from foreign exchange on operating profit for the segment this quarter was approximately $5 million. Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $50 million in the quarter. For the fiscal fourth quarter, we experienced inflation of about 3%, as cost increases on certain inputs such as dairy and protein accelerated. On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $53 million, down about 36% from the prior year quarter.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.6 billion or up about 1% from the prior year quarter. The net sales increase reflects stronger volume performance, offset by the pass-through of lower wheat costs in our flour milling business.","The Commercial Foods segment's operating profit adjusted for items impacting comparability was $190 million, or slightly above the year ago period. This primarily reflects stronger volumes and lower SG&A costs, offset by negative price mix across the segment.","As Gary noted, subsequent to fiscal 2014 year-end, we completed the formation of Ardent Mills, which included the divestiture of three flour mills at the end of fiscal 2014. In connection with the sale of these three flour mills, we recognized a gain of approximately $91 million, which we treat as a comparability item. The company will also record a significant gain in connection with the formation of Ardent Mills in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. This gain while preliminarily estimated to be in excess of $500 million will also be reflected as an item impacting comparability. I will say more about the impacts of the transaction on cash flow, debt repayment and future earnings in a few moments.","Our Private Brand segment delivered net sales for the quarter of $1.0 billion and operating profit excluding items impacting comparability of approximately $44 million. The results reflect significant margin compression, driven by the pricing concessions over the past several quarters, which were made to protect volume in the business. The results also reflect unfavorable mix and higher costs related to the operational challenges we have faced. While more than offset by the negative impact of pricing and operational challenges, we have realized over $30 million of COGS and SG&A synergies in fiscal 2014.","Moving on to corporate expenses; for the quarter, corporate expenses were approximately $65 million. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, corporate expenses were $62 million versus $93 million in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower incentive compensation and pension costs, and the impact of efficiency initiatives.","Now I will move on to my next topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $1.31 per diluted share of net expense in the quarter's reported EPS related to several items. As previously discussed, we recorded $681 million or $1.47 per share of non-cash charges related to intangible asset impairments.","In addition, in our Commercial Foods segment, we recorded a gain of approximately $91 million or $0.13 per share, related to the sale of three flour mills in connection with the formation of Ardent Mills; and $5 million or $0.01 per share related to a gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.","Next, we recorded approximately $59 million or $0.08 per share of net expense related to integration and restructuring costs. On hedging, for the fiscal fourth quarter, the net hedging gain, included in corporate expenses was approximately $14 million or $0.02 per share.","We also recorded a tax benefit of about $27 million or approximately $0.06 per share, primarily related to benefits from changes in legal structure and state [indiscernible] positions and the resolution of certain foreign income tax matters. And finally in the fiscal fourth quarter, we recognized the net benefit related to historical legal matters of $10 million or approximately $0.02 per share.","Next, I will cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $183 million of cash on hand, and $142 million in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. We continue to emphasize cash flow within our business, and for fiscal year 2014, we delivered operating cash flows of approximately $1.55 billion, better than our expectations.","On working capital, for fiscal year 2014, working capital changes contributed modestly to operating cash flow. On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $131 million versus $163 million in the prior year, and for the full fiscal year, our CapEx was approximately $602 million. Net interest expense was $93 million in the fiscal fourth quarter versus $102 million in the year ago quarter. dividends for the quarter were $105 million versus $104 million in the year ago quarter.","On capital allocation, as we have noted previously, our capital allocation priority through fiscal year 2015 will be the repayment of debt. In fiscal 2014, we repaid in excess of $600 million of debt, exceeding our previous estimate of $550 million. In connection with the formation of Ardent Mills, in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we received proceeds from the sales of three mills and distributions from Ardent Mills, which totaled approximately $569 million, or about $527 million after estimated tax liabilities.","As we have previously discussed, we expect to use the proceeds, primarily to accelerate our debt repayment and to increase our target to approximately $2.0 billion by the end of 2015.","By the end of fiscal 2015, we expect to have repaid around $2 billion of debt, since the closing of the Ralcorp transaction, and with a stronger balance sheet, we expect to have more flexibility in our capital allocation to consider dividend increases, share repurchases, and additional growth investments.","We remain committed to a strong dividend, and we will maintain our current annual dividend rate at $1 per share as we delever. However, during this period, we will limit our share repurchases. This quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. And while we expect limited acquisition activity in the near term as we repay debt, we will continue to prudently support the right investments for our business.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2015 outlook and our long term algorithm. First on our fiscal 2015 outlook, we currently expect fiscal 2015 diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to grow at a rate in the mid single digits, from our fiscal 2014 base of $2.17.","Here are a few relevant points for fiscal 2015; first on Ardent Mills, fiscal 2015 earnings from the joint venture are expected to be about $0.08 per diluted share lower than the fiscal 2014 comparable earnings from ConAgra Mills. As a reminder, after the close of the transaction, earnings from this joint venture will be reported as equity investment earnings, and in fiscal 2015, we will only reflect 11 months of such earnings, due to the transition to new accounting periods for Ardent Mills.","I would also note that beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect to reflect ConAgra Mills as discontinued operations, so our reported results for prior periods will be reduced to reflect the removal of ConAgra Mills results from such periods due to our anticipated adoption of new accounting rules. This treatment does not affect our view of our 2014 earnings base.","In our Consumer Foods segment, we expect sequentially improving volume performance and stronger operating profit performance. This fiscal 2015 outlook also reflects modest gross margin improvement in our Consumer Foods segment, driven by mix improvements and strong cost savings, partially offset by inflation in the range of 2% to 3%. The segment is also expected to realize SG&A savings from our effectiveness and efficiency initiatives.","For fiscal 2015, we expect total productivity including synergies from the Ralcorp acquisition to be about $200 million in our Consumer Foods segment. We also expect a modest decrease in our advertising and promotion costs, as we focus more effort on in-store execution.","In our Commercial Foods segment, excluding ConAgra Mills, which will be classified as discontinued operations, we expect this segment to reflect good sales and profit growth, led by stronger performance in our Lamb Weston business driven by international growth, and improved margins from a better potato crop beginning in the second quarter. We expect that our other food service and commercial businesses in this segment will post moderate growth in fiscal 2015.","In our Private Brands segment, we expect volumes to improve over the course of the year. As Gary noted, we are very focused on margin recovery in this segment, and also expect to see gradual improvement as we move through fiscal 2015, driven by pricing and mix improvements and productivity including synergies and SG&A benefits.","While we are disappointed in the current profitability level, we are confident that the improvements in our business execution over time will drive sustainable profitable growth.","Our outlook also reflects the expectation that cost synergies resulting from the Ralcorp acquisition will reach $300 million of annual pre-tax benefits by fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate will be in the range of 34% for the full year although this rate may fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter.","Importantly, we expect to generate approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal year 2015, which we expect will provide us ample cash to achieve our fiscal 2015 debt repayment target.","We do expect our profit growth in fiscal 2015 to be skewed to the second half, with the first quarter comparable EPS to be slightly below year ago levels, due to several factors, including the timing of profit improvement in our Private Brands segment, and for certain brands within our Consumer Group segment; the timing of the new crop in Lamb Weston, which will benefit earnings beginning in the fall; the timing of Ardent Mills' operations and synergy ramp-up and the loss of one month of earnings from Ardent Mills in the first quarter, due to its change in accounting periods, and the increasing impact from SG&A cost reductions as the year progresses. I reiterate that we expect EPS growth in the mid-single digits for the full fiscal year.","On our long term outlook, after fiscal 2015, we expect comparable diluted EPS to grow at a rate of -- in the high single digits annually. We also expect long term annual sales growth in the range of 3% to 4%.","In summary, fiscal 2014 has been a challenging transitional year for ConAgra Foods. While we are disappointed with our financial results, we remain focused on addressing operational challenges, and ultimately delivering more consistent profitable growth over the long term.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. Gary and I along with Tom McGough and Paul Maass will be happy to take your questions.","I will now turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we'd like to get to an important part of today's call, taking your questions. (Operator Instructions). And it looks like our first question today will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Thanks for the question.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Two things for me. I guess first Gary, as you have stated in isolation, it\u2019s fair to say the Ralcorp acquisition hasn't gone well so far. And at the same time, the core business trends have deteriorated further still. So I guess my question is whether management and the Board are willing now to take a harder look at the portfolio, and make some reasoned decisions regarding where you take the business from here and sort of what factors would play into those sorts of decisions and analysis, and then I have got a follow-up?","Gary Rodkin","Andrew, that -- clearly a good question, clear point given this year and I completely understand where that's coming from. But keep in mind, this year was highly unusual. I believe that fiscal 2014 really isn't about our portfolio, it's truly about our execution. We do have, I believe a portfolio that can and will deliver sustainable profitable growth, and generate strong cash flow. Our portfolio has some strong categories, like Private Brands. We have got good opportunities in channels like Club, Dollar and C-Store, and we have got some real strong growing geographies, particularly on Lamb Weston international.","So we are happy with the breadth and the reach of our portfolio. But what we need to do now, now that the turbulence of F\u201814 is behind us, now that we are in the implementation phase of our company-wide effectiveness and efficiency initiative is to execute. Our focus in fiscal 2015 is on execution, and we believe that mid-single digit growth in fiscal 2015 as we stabilize and then high single digit growth in F \u201816 and beyond plus continue to pay good dividend should make for pretty good shareholder returns.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Thanks for that. Then with respect to the consumer branded business, I guess a lot of the reason why advertising and marketing was down in the quarter significantly was shifting a lot of that over to more promotional spend, in store efforts and such. And yet at the same time, obviously the branded pace of volume decelerated pretty significantly. So it doesn't seem like whatever that process was, you got the results that you were looking for, and I understand there is a piece of this which was some SKUs in frozen coming out and such, but that in theory you would have known about, when you were expecting volume to still be down three or four. So I am really just trying to get, I guess, a better understanding of what really happened there, around the consumer volume piece?","Gary Rodkin","Yeah, let me start and then I will turn over to Tom for a little bit more color. To put it very succinctly Andrew, the industry volume in response to merchandising and just overall post Easter across the industry was very weak, so we did not anticipate that, and secondarily there was some late -- in Q4, some late shifting of merchandising on some of our business to spill over into first quarter 2015. Tom, any more color?","Tom McGough","Sure Andrew. I think what I'd like to add to that is, what we are seeing in store and the impact that it's having on overall merchandising. I think the challenge that many manufacturers face, including ourselves, is that there is more competition for the limited space in stores. And certainly what we have seen is a lower lift as a result of that.","So as we think about it, there is really three components that we are focused on. In Frozen, there has been an increase of overall competitive activity. We have bolstered our support. We have been competitive in our programs, and our market share primarily in the premium and value segments with Marie Callender's, Bertolli and Banquet for the fiscal year are up both in terms of volume and dollar share. We feel like we have struck the right balance there and those are businesses that we will continue to invest in.","The second is, being able to -- in this environment of competition is to find ways to break through, and there are two ways that we are doing that. In Chef Boyardee, we have seen a lot of concurrent merchandising. We have traditionally enjoyed exclusivity in our events, and throughout the year, we have experimented with different approaches to get a higher lift. We had some very positive impacts with that, with some customers in Q4. We are going to be implementing that on a much broader basis, throughout the fiscal year, and we will see a better impact from that.","And then finally, it\u2019s just about ideas, and where we do really-really well is when we bring those consumer insights, particularly around meal solution, and easy to execute solutions for retailers, we win and we see that on Hunt's, ROTEL, many items in our portfolio. So it\u2019s a challenging environment. We are tackling it category by category and we believe ultimately we will have a positive outcome from that.","Operator","And we have a question now from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning David.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Gary, I have two questions. The first one relates to the Consumer Foods business and then it\u2019s going to come back to the strategic issue that Andrew was talking about. So Orville Redenbacher in the popcorn category, when I just look at my Nielsen data, you have a fairly sizeable price advantage versus the number two brand, Pop Secret. That business according to our Nielsen data has lost an unbelievable amount of share, 760 basis points a share, down 17% in our data. The category though looks awesome, the category is up 8%, so I can't even feel like we can give this thing credit for a tough environment, because the environment for popcorn looks terrific. The question here is not so specific about popcorn, it\u2019s just popcorn feels like the piece of evidence that says, why not take a much harder look at strategic review on the portfolio, because you are not getting the value out of this that you need to be getting, and given where the stock is, selling some assets and buying some stock back seems to make phenomenal sense from a shareholder value creation. So can you give us some thoughts on this?","Gary Rodkin","Yes, David, fair question, totally understandable and as concerned you are on the Orville Redenbacher performance, it doesn't come close to how frustrated I am with that performance. We need to do better there, and we have a lot of efforts in place to tackle exactly what you are talking about. Now to segue into your other question and what Andrew touched on as well, let me just say, that we are pragmatic. You have seen me demonstrate that in my 8.5 years here with significant transactions and just last week, we closed on the Ardent Mills JV, so we are still believing in our portfolio. We believe that the things we are doing will improve the performance. But we will always look through the lens of creating long term shareholder value.","Operator","We will move now to JP Morgan's Ken Goldman.","Ken Goldman - J.P. Morgan","Hey, thanks for the question. Gary, the SKU reductions in Healthy Choice you referenced, to what extent, I guess, are they driven by your decisions, to focus on higher growth items versus the customer's decision to concentrate a bit themselves on faster turning SKUs? I am trying to get a sense for the risk of further SKU reductions like you saw with Healthy Choice a year ago, versus what's sort of being pulled back on your own?","Gary Rodkin","Yeah Ken. I clearly understand where you're coming from on that. That is totally us. And it's not to say that they don't have a little bit to do with each other, because velocity is what really counts, that shelf space is valuable. But this is something we have been very proactively tackling over the last 12 months or so, because we do have a very strong piece of that business or sub-line of Cafe Steamers continues to grow very strongly, because it's extremely different in the marketplace, and that continues to grow. So we are very consciously culling other sub-lines and slow moving SKUs to give more prominence and more focus to the Cafe Steamers line, and that has been a very big portion of why the volume is down, once we reach the kind of shelf placement that we want, I think we will start to see better performance in Healthy Choice.","Operator","We will take a question now from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Hi Gary. I would just simply love to understand better the sources of margin pressure on the retailer branded business. The magnitude of each pressure. For instance, during these calls, you had mentioned the need to reinvest in sales, restore the price gaps, and essentially rebid for some portions of your business with certain retailers. Could you talk about the magnitude of these pressures and perhaps, how these drags may be diminishing the coming quarters? Thanks.","Gary Rodkin","Yeah, let me start on that, and then let me turn it over to Paul, who can get more granular for you. You know that we acquired Ralcorp because of our deep conviction in the long term private brand growth, because of its relevance to consumers and customers and its underdevelopment in the U.S., a whole host of reasons and we still strongly believe in that. And you know that our strategy is to bring our operating capabilities, our infrastructure and our scale to a very fragmented industry. But as you have alluded to, we have dug ourselves a whole in the first full year, and a big piece of what you're referencing is because we had execution and service level issues that really put us on shaky ground with our customers, those are fixed; and our organization is maturing, particularly on the sales front, and what that's going to do, is enable us to partner with our customers, because they are gaining confidence in our reliability, our responsiveness, the capabilities we can bring, and we could be much more proactive, versus as I said before, that we were on our heels.","So we will grow volume this year. We will begin to improve our margins in the second half. We will get past some of these short term cost issues, and we will start to bring some of those cost synergies to the bottom line and accelerate our performance, as we get into F 2016 and beyond. So we still have very strong conviction, but we did have a whole host of issues to deal with, that culminated to oversimplify in a lot of price concessions to stabilize. So Paul, some more color?","Paul Maass","Yeah just, integration itself was challenging; and when you have a situation where your customers are really motivated to change suppliers, because we are letting them down on service and execution issues. You got to really pull the price lever to maintain the volumes. The good news is, we are in a much more stable position. We have fixed service issues and execution issues. Better than me, we don't have a continuous improvement mindset to always look for better ways to run the business and improve. But we are much more stable, and we will drive margin improvement and top line growth here as we go forward.","Operator","Jonathan Feeney with Athlos Research has our next question.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning. Thanks very much.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning Jonathan.","Jonathan Feeney - Athlos Research","Couple of questions. Gary, we talked on these calls about some of the really personnel level and management level changes that were made in a different operating businesses of Ralcorp, and how you had to -- you changed some of those, may be put some resources back in, some people back in, so the decisions are getting made closer to the customer. Can you tell me what comfort you have with the team you have on the field right now there and the structure of those businesses?","Gary Rodkin","Yeah, let me turn it over to Paul, because I think he can give you some real live color on that.","Paul Maass","Yeah, we reacted to the reorganization that was done right when we acquired Ralcorp, like it would be beneficial to have decision making, like you said, close to the customer; created six business units with general managers that are running each of those. Yes, disappointed in our fourth quarter results, but have confidence in the structure and the leadership team we have to improve the business and the results going forward, with a really intensified focus on expanding margins.","Gary Rodkin","And I would tell you Jonathan that, a lot of it has to do with the customer interface, and we frankly have done some course correcting very recently in this effectiveness of efficiency work, to make sure that we have got deeper product knowledge on the front line. That's something that I think we tried to go a bit too broad in the first iteration, and now we are narrowing that product focus now, because we have realized just how important it is to really have the expertise at the buyer level, the front line buyer level. So that is a pretty significant change that we have very recently implemented.","Operator","We will move now to Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi thanks. I guess I agree that it's probably too soon to pass judgment on the marriage of private label and brand and as you said, you have been spending the past year, fighting fires. But Gary I was wondering, is it fair to say that you are also stretching some of your resources of your team, more than they have in the past. Like, when I think about your sales function and Doug Knudsen, to what extent was his time being stretched to have to deal with all these customer issues on private label? And do you think that it had an impact on the branded business' volumes falling as well, just in terms of how he spent his time? And then I just wanted to understand what Al Bolles is doing now. He is now taking on the supply chain role; and private label is a very complicated supply chain function, and I want to know to the extent that he is going to be taking that role of the working capital management and all of that, that's entailed?","Gary Rodkin","Yes. That's a very thoughtful set of questions there, as I would always expect from you. On the first one, in any major acquisition, you are going to stretcher organization, so clearly that has happened. But in recognizing as we have gone through fighting so many fires, more than we anticipated, that really was the basis for this effectiveness of the efficiency work, which has really given us a very granular look at all of our processes, all of our structures. We have been extremely granular on that, and have really worked to have the effectiveness drive the efficiency. So we talk about the savings side of that initiative, but even more important is the effectiveness side of it. Culminating in better resource allocation, faster decision making, more customer responsiveness etcetera. So we clearly have -- are in process of making some pretty significant structural changes, to ensure that we can manage through.","Now we are past so much of the fire. It was brutal, to be honest, on the organization in the past year. But I would say that, we are well beyond that. So that's really where I think we are at.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Good morning folks. Thanks for the question.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","So you mentioned, you anticipate improvement in Consumer Foods and top line throughout the year. Can you give us a better sense of the volume growth that your guidance is predicated on for that business?","Tom McGough","Jason, this is Tom McGough, and with regard to Consumer Foods volume, what we see is sequential performance improvement throughout the year. It's going to be driven by three factors. Clearly job one is improving the overall volume and share performance on our core business. We have talked about the three challenged businesses that we have, initiatives being put in place and we should see sequential improvement on that. The vast majority of our portfolio is actually done very well in terms of growing share, and we are going to sustain that performance.","I think what's different going into next year will be two other factors; one is just a new focus on winning and growing channels. Whether it's Club, Dollar, C-Store, they are growing at a much faster rate than traditional grocery. Over the last year, we have worked, customized our product, packaging, merchandising programs to succeed in those classes of trade and we are well positioned, going into FY 2015 to see a market improvement in our top line as a result of that.","And then finally, international, while international is a smaller part of our overall portfolio, its starting to have a more significant impact. Our plan there is to grow with our global customers, as they expand globally, and we are seeing good sales acceleration in emerging markets like Mexico and Latin America.","While it's a relatively challenging environment, we expect that our business will show sequential improvement throughout the year.","Gary Rodkin","And Jason, just to put a marker on that, we expect to be about flat to slightly down for the year. So we are not looking for bigger roll-ups, but we are looking for that improvement Tom talked about.","Operator","We will move now to Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi good morning. Just one clarification and then a more broader strategy question. The 217 base John that you're using, does that include or exclude the dilution from Ardent?","John Gehring","The 217 base, that's just based off of this year, so there is no dilution from Ardent in the current year. We will be comparing next year, which will have some dilution in it to the 217 base.","Chris Klinefelter","This is Chris, the mid-single digit rate of growth that we are signing up for next year, includes dilution from Ardent.","Gary Rodkin","Eric, did you have a follow-up?","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Gary if these -- some of these brands like healthy choice and others, you know you put over the last seven, eight years, a tremendous amount of effort to rejuvenate position against the consumer and it has been a struggle. And I am just wondering versus kind of Andrew's point of breaking up the company or something, maybe another option to think about is, why not manage those businesses more for cash, and use that to fund the growth in private label, which obviously you believe in $7 billion plus investment. Why isn't that a viable option for the business?","Gary Rodkin","Yeah Eric, clearly good question. We have built into our guidance, realistic growth expectations, and we do segment our businesses, and as we see rationale for moving things into more of a managed-for-cash mode, which we do in a number of our businesses, they move in there. So I would tell you that the fixes that we have in place on those three problem brands, really are pretty tactical right now, and they really have to prove their mettle with a very high bar to go get any kind of significant marketing investment from this point forward. So that's may be a slightly different way of saying, we are looking at things a bit like you're suggesting.","Operator","We will now go to Bryan Spillane with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","David Lee - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning. This is actually David Lee in for Bryan.","Gary Rodkin","Good morning David.","David Lee - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Just had a question on the Private Brands business and some of the pricing concessions that you had taken earlier this year; and given that this work has made progress in stabilizing some of the relationships, is there a sense or evidence or examples that the advantages of having these two businesses under the same roof is coming into play? So I guess customers recognizing the higher quality and what way that's contributing to the better margin outlook for the business? And also I guess my understanding was that, some of these were in part due to the competitive environment, so any detail that you can provide on the overall environment will be helpful.","Gary Rodkin","Yeah, David I would tell you that, we have really been back on our heels this year. So there is no getting around that. We have had to be very reactive in putting out fires and trying to basically maintain our customer relationships. That's pretty much behind us. We put a lot of effort into fixing that, and then a lot of investment into maintaining that business with the price concessions. So we really haven't had the ability in any kind of a big way to take advantage of what we talk about as the one plus one equals three. We do have some specific customer examples where that has worked in combining the two, and that gives us conviction that once we can be much more proactive and have the confidence of our customers, that we will be able to start leveraging those capabilities. But we really haven't seen that, because we haven't been able to focus the energy on that yet.","Part of my confidence on our future and private brands, interaction with the customers and the combined strength of having the branded -- and private branded businesses together in those strategic discussions on things we can do, from a strategic partnership.","Chris Klinefelter","Operator, this is Chris, I'd like to ask that we just have one final question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question today will come from Akshay Jagdale with KeyBanc.","Akshay Jagdale - KeyBanc","Thanks for taking the question, I will make it quick. Can you -- I am just trying to understand where and how you are going to get improved performance on private label over time? What would be really helpful is if you could just give us some color on what categories or product groups you have seen the share loss in, and may be if you can comment on -- you have lost share at the expense of margin, and you would have lost more share, I guess, if you hadn't given up pricing. So how do we get back share and improve margins from here? That's really the bigger picture question, but if you can give some color on what category and product groups, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Paul Maass","This is Paul. I will just hit on a couple of different things. From a top line perspective, confidence and modest growth, as we go through 2015, distribution gains, improved mix and gaining new profitable incremental business because we are in a much better position from a stable executing environment. What will help drive earnings growth is on the operational side, and Gary had mentioned in his script, the network optimization and some plant closures, the changes in our distribution network. These are really good projects, its really about taking one step back to take two steps forward. There are increased expenses in the short term, benefit us and position us to win long term, and we are accelerating that. Those are good products and -- projects and I could see the benefits on the long haul, and that's where -- we will push them through as fast as we can.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I will hand the conference back to you for final remarks, for closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in today's news release. And as always, we are available for discussions. Thank you very much for your interest in ConAgra Foods.","Operator","This concludes today's ConAgra Food's fourth quarter earnings conference call.

My name is Jessica Morgan, and I will be your conference facilitator. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Gary Rodkin, Chief Executive Officer of ConAgra Foods. Please go ahead, Mr. Rodkin.","Gary M. Rodkin","Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Thanks for joining us today. I'm Gary Rodkin, and I'm here with John Gehring, our CFO; and Chris Klinefelter, VP of Investor Relations.","This morning, we'll talk about our strong fiscal 2013 first quarter performance and our upwardly revised outlook for the remainder of the year. And then, we'll open up the call for your questions. At that point, Andr\u00e9 Hawaux, President of Consumer Foods; and Paul Maass, President of Commercial Foods, will join us. Before we get started, Chris has a few opening remarks.","Chris Klinefelter","Good morning. During today's remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements, and while we're making those statements in good faith and are confident about our company's direction, we do not have any guarantee about the result that we will achieve. If you'd like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and affect our business, I'll refer you to the documents we file with the SEC, which include cautionary language.","Also, we'll be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, the question-and-answer document, or on our website under the Financial Reports and Filings link and then choosing Non-GAAP Reconciliations.","Now I'll turn it back over to Gary.","Gary M. Rodkin","Thanks, Chris.","I'm very excited about our strong start to the year. EPS on a comparable basis was $0.44 for the first quarter, a strong year-over-year improvement. The overall quality of the quarter was high. Specifically, I'm talking about the fact that both of our segments grew comparable operating profits, while we increased marketing investment at a double-digit rate.","Given the strong start to the year, we have raised our full year expectations for comparable EPS to the range of $2.03 to $2.06, which is approximately 10% to 12% comparable growth. And that's including a significant increase in brand-building investment, which we view as good for the long-term health of our business. It's clear that our operating capabilities, strategic initiatives and the recent acquisitions are generating strong EPS benefit for our shareholders and allowing us to post high-quality performance in the midst of difficult marketplace conditions.","Before I go on to the segment highlights, I'll also emphasize that we raised our dividend today to $0.25 per share, starting with the upcoming December payment. The annualized dividend is now $1 per share. We generate strong cash flows as a company, and we're confident that we can continue to provide a top-tier attractive dividend to shareholders while pursuing a balanced approach to capital allocation, including organic investments, M&A, share repurchase, and our commitment to a strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit rating.","Now I'll move to the Consumer Foods segment. Sales were up 8%, driven by acquisitions. Operating profit increased 20% as reported and 14% on a comparable basis, including a double-digit increase in marketing investment. Overall, this segment posted a very good quarter.","A few remarks on the sales performance. Acquisitions contributed 8 points of sales growth. You know from our comments over the past year or so that we've completed 6 transactions, strategically adding to our portfolio, and these are helping drive stronger top line and bottom line performance. I'll say more about this in a minute.","Organically, 5% favorable price\/mix offset a 4% organic volume decline, and foreign exchange weighed on sales by 1 point. The favorable price\/mix was the result of prior pricing actions taken to combat inflation. The volume decline reflects the elasticity of those actions and the difficult consumer environment. And in some situations, it's the result of deliberate decisions that came with a trade-off. For example, we anticipated that the pricing actions for Banquet, our largest Consumer Foods brand, would negatively impact volumes. And in this situation, we chose favorable mix and margins over volume, and the actions have resulted in net profit growth for the brand as we intended. We expect the Consumer Foods volume performance to improve sequentially throughout the fiscal year for reasons I'll touch on in a minute.","We again saw very strong results from the Marie Callender's brand. Single-serve meals, multi-serve meals and desserts all showed very good growth in dollar, volume and share for the quarter. We aim to keep this kind of growth going with strong levels of new advertising that's on the air now, continuing with the Time to Savor campaign that's worked so well for Marie Callender's over the past couple of years.","Slim Jim continued its strong performance this quarter, increasing market share in a growing meat snacks category, and also growing nicely in alternative channels. This brand is a good example of success with our non-traditional integrated marketing campaigns. The Male Spice Loss campaign you might remember from CAGNY has worked really well in social media channels, and the Slim Jim Facebook fan base continues to grow every day. The Slim Jim community now has more than 1 million members. We've also amped up our marketing very recently with a new partnership with EA Video, the worldwide leader in gaming software, backed by a strong supporting media campaign.","I'll also comment on a couple of regional brands that are gaining strength nationally, Ro*Tel Tomatoes and Wolf Chili. Both have grown over the past year from strong regional players into national brands. They are impressively growing share, net sales and volume. We've supported these brands with impactful marketing and it's working. They're good examples of smaller brands that we've grown to make meaningful contribution.","Comparable Consumer Foods' operating profit grew 14%, and that, again, includes a 20% increase in marketing spend for our base business. We're very pleased with that profit performance, particularly in this difficult business environment. This is a situation where our total margin management efforts, meaning pricing architecture, deliberate mix management and strong productivity initiatives, more than offset inflation, and this drove gross margin expansion in the core business.","Inflation is less severe now than it was a year or so ago, and that, of course, is helpful to margins. To be clear, we're still experiencing inflation but at a significantly lower rate than we saw for most of fiscal '12.","As I mentioned earlier, acquisitions also made a substantial contribution to profit growth. As most of you know, over the past few quarters, we have completed 6 transactions, and these are consistent with our Recipe for Growth that we've discussed before. That's our strategic road map designed to continually strengthen our portfolio by finding new growth opportunities.","We remain focused on 3 strategic areas: one, expanding core adjacencies; two, growing our private label business; and three, increasing our international presence. Our disciplined buying strategy is focused on having the right assets, the right operational elements and the right price. Our approach is to leverage our strong operating foundation in terms of supply chain, marketing, innovation, product quality and sales distribution to create truly sustainable value. We're pleased with our progress on the integrations.","Our most recent transaction, completed late in the quarter, was the purchase of Bertolli and P.F. Chang's Home Menu multi-serve frozen meals from Unilever. Together, these brands represent about $300 million in annual sales and are very strong equities. They represent very high quality Italian and Asian food targeted at a higher income segment at higher price points. These brands bring us new consumers and new eating occasions, and we intend to leverage our innovation and operational capabilities to optimize their performance.","As we've said before, we expect to continue adding to our portfolio with the same strategy and discipline as the right opportunities develop.","As I wrap up my comments on Consumer Foods, I'll say that we expect inflation to be less severe than we originally planned. John will say more on this. And we expect the rest of the year's organic volume to gradually improve for a handful of reasons. We'll lap pricing actions taken last fiscal year. We expect to benefit from our innovation pipeline. Our latest round of new products, including Healthy Choice and Marie Callender's Bakes, Healthy Choice Greek Frozen Yogurt and the Marie Callender's single-serve cream pies, are all ramping up in terms of store presence and points of distribution. We expect these to make a good contribution to sales and volume for the full fiscal year, and we'll support them with marketing and additional new items as the year progresses.","We also expect to benefit from our marketing investments. And we're gaining traction with Customer Connect, a series of initiatives designed to leverage our insights and make us a strong strategic partner to our customers through joint business planning. We're excited about customer feedback thus far.","Moving on to Commercial Foods. Sales increased 5% over year-ago amounts. All the product lines in the segment posted volume growth. And the overall sales dollar growth was driven by Lamb Weston, our largest brand, which grew unit volume and posted good price\/mix, with particular success in international markets, which grew at a double-digit rate. We're very excited about the strong growth opportunities internationally, and we're aligned with global customers who have dynamic growth plans in emerging markets and who look to us to be a key supplier, playing an important role in their global growth initiatives.","Domestically, retail demand for food prepared at home continues to be relatively soft, as we just discussed. But away-from-home eating occasions have held up better, and we've benefited from that. We've focused -- we're focused around high-growth opportunities and operational efficiencies domestically, and we'll say more about both of those aspects in a minute.","Lamb Weston continues to expand into higher-margin products, and our biggest example of this is Sweet Potato Fries. We're capitalizing on the investment we made a few years ago when we built a state-of-the-art processing facility. We're making progress in QSRs and casual dining. We're in more than 20 significant quick-serve or fast-casual restaurants now with Sweet Potato Fries on their regular menu or with limited time offers. We expect that to accelerate.","Another example of mix improvement at Lamb Weston is our focus on the higher-end consumer at retail through our Alexia brand, which we've grown to over a $100-million brand in just a few years. This is a great way for us to strengthen customer relationships, grow our share and play a leadership role at retail in the frozen potato category. Additionally, we're driving growth and success in retail with a licensed brand strategy. The most recent example is Arby's Curly Fries, which are off to a great start.","At retail, we also provide private label potato products for the value-conscious consumer. While the overall frozen potato category has been intensely promotional recently, we're committed to this category for the long term.","As reported, segment profit increased 43%. Comparable segment profits increased 37% -- tremendous growth -- driven by Lamb Weston's momentum in terms of good sales performance and favorable product mix, as well as operating efficiencies related to a smooth crop transition. In that regard, our ongoing productivity and cost savings initiatives are on track, and you can see the benefit of that in the financial results we just posted.","ConAgra Mills profits were in line with year-ago amounts. And based on the way things are shaping up, we expect them to have a good second half of the fiscal year.","We're pleased with the start to the fiscal year in both operating segments, and I hope you can tell that we're excited about fiscal 2013. This is a year where a combination of our core operating and margin management capabilities in both segments, less severe inflation and the benefit of recent acquisitions are expected to drive very good EPS performance and allow for a strong increase in brand investment. Our organization is focused on delivering our increased EPS target of $2.03 to $2.06 on a comparable basis, which is very good growth, especially in the midst of difficult marketplace conditions. This is a significant milestone for our team.","On a related note, we achieved another milestone very recently. Last week, we learned that in addition to being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for 2 straight years, we've also been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time, a significant achievement. As you may know, these indices are very tough to make, and they're important to us because they're an extremely comprehensive measure of our total citizenship efforts from employee safety to corporate governance and across the supply chain.","This recognition is fitting given our overall progress at ConAgra Foods. As you know, we've worked very hard these last 6 to 7 years to transform ConAgra Foods into the strong operating company that it is today. We've invested in capabilities, infrastructure and talents across the organization. We have a very clear strategy -- our Recipe for Growth -- and that will help us continue the transformation. The marketplace conditions are still challenging, but we're pleased with what we've accomplished and we're confident that we'll continue to deliver on our commitments.","Now I'll turn it over to John.","John F. Gehring","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to touch on 4 topics this morning. I'll begin with our first quarter performance highlights. Next, I'll address comparability matters. Then onto cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. And finally, I will provide some comments on our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013.","Let's start with our first quarter performance highlights. For the quarter, we reported net sales of $3.3 billion, up 7%, driven by pricing and acquisitions in our Consumer Foods segment. And in our Commercial Foods segment, we had volume gains in both Lamb Weston and flour milling, as well as improved pricing and mix in our Lamb Weston business. Net sales also reflect the impact of lower year-over-year wheat prices in our flour milling operations.","In this quarter, we reported fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.61 versus $0.22 in the year-ago period. Adjusting for items impacting comparability, fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44 versus $0.31 in the prior-year quarter, a 42% increase. And while this is very strong performance, I would note that the year-ago first quarter was our softest quarter in fiscal 2012.","While Gary addressed our segment results in some detail, I would like to touch on a few highlights, starting with our Consumer Foods segment, where net sales for the quarter were approximately $2 billion, up about 8% from the year-ago period. This reflects 8 points of growth from acquisitions. Organic net sales were essentially flat as favorable mix [ph] of about 5% was offset by a 4% base volume decline and foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on net sales this quarter.","Our Consumer Foods segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, was $242 million or up about 14% from the year-ago period. While acquisitions contributed to the operating profit growth, more of the growth came from margin management in the base business, driven by pricing and cost savings, offset by moderating inflation. The higher operating profit also reflects increased marketing costs and about a negative 2% impact from foreign exchange this quarter.","Our Consumer Foods supply chain cost-reduction programs continue to yield good results and delivered cost savings of approximately $75 million in the quarter. These programs are expected to deliver over $240 million of cost savings for the full fiscal year. For the fiscal first quarter, we experienced inflation of about 3%, a bit better than our expectations.","On marketing, Consumer Foods advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $95 million, up about 24% from the prior-year quarter, principally driven by increased investment against our base business.","In our Commercial Foods segment, net sales were approximately $1.3 billion or up about 5%, reflecting strong international growth in Lamb Weston and improved volume and mix across the segment, as well as disciplined pricing in our Lamb Weston business, where we increased prices to offset higher input costs. The pass-through of lower wheat costs in the milling operations had a negative $38-million impact on sales for this fiscal quarter.","The Commercial Foods segment operating profit, adjusted for items impacting comparability, increased 37% from the year-ago period to $140 million. The strong year-over-year performance reflects continued good fundamentals at both Lamb Weston and ConAgra Mills, as well as the soft performance in the prior year quarter.","Within this segment, Lamb Weston posted a very strong double-digit rate of profit growth, driven by a strong international growth, favorable volumes and price\/mix, as well as production efficiencies including a smooth crop transition. ConAgra Mills' operating profit was in line with the year-ago period, and overall, we are very pleased with the performance of this segment.","Corporate expenses, adjusted for items impacting comparability, were $75 million for the quarter versus $67 million in the year-ago quarter. The reported tax rate for the fiscal quarter was approximately 33%, and the rate on comparable earnings was slightly lower.","Now I'll move onto my second topic, items impacting comparability. Overall, we have approximately $0.17 per diluted share of net income in this quarter's EPS related to several items. First, on hedging. For the fiscal first quarter, the net hedging gain included in corporate expense was approximately $130 million or $0.20 per share. This number is larger than what we typically see, but it is consistent with the level of volatility in the commodity markets. I'll say a bit more about our hedging in a moment.","Next, we recorded $4 million or $0.01 per share of restructuring and other onetime charges related to our cost reduction and organizational efficiency initiatives, principally in our Consumer Foods segment. In addition, we recorded approximately $7 million or $0.01 per share of acquisition-related expenses. And finally, we recorded approximately $8 million or $0.02 per share of expense related to legal matters which relate to prior years.","Next, I'll cover my third topic, cash flow, capital and balance sheet items. First, we ended the quarter with $117 million of cash on hand and $272 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. The increased level of commercial paper borrowings is principally related to funding acquisitions. And subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our outstanding commercial paper borrowings with the proceeds of our recent debt issuance that I'll say more about in a few moments.","We continue to emphasize cash flow within our business, and for fiscal 2013 we expect to deliver strong operating cash flows in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And on working capital, we continue to make progress against our working capital initiatives. For the full fiscal year, we expect that working capital improvements in our base business will contribute modestly to cash flow from continuing operations as we continue to improve our cash conversion cycle metrics.","On capital expenditures for the quarter, we had capital expenditures of $99 million versus $96 million in the prior-year period. And for the full fiscal year, we now expect CapEx to modestly exceed our previous estimate of $450 million [ph] due to some additional growth investments we expect to pursue.","Net interest expense was $49 million in the first quarter versus $53 million in the year-ago quarter. Dividends for the quarter increased from $94 million in the year-ago quarter to $98 million, reflecting a higher dividend rate, offset by a lower number of shares.","And now let's turn to capital allocation. And let's start with growth. We continue to execute against our growth strategy focused on strategic adjacencies, private label and international. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Bertolli and P.F. Chang's multi-serve frozen meals. These brands are great additions to our frozen portfolio, and we're excited about the growth opportunities we can pursue with the combination of these brands and our frozen innovation capability.","Going forward, we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities where there is a strategic fit and a good financial return, and we are confident that we can further leverage our capabilities and our strong balance sheet to create value by investing for growth in a disciplined manner. We also remain focused on organic growth and profit enhancement investments, including investments to support innovation, production capacity and our cost savings initiatives.","The other elements of our balanced capital allocation approach also remained unchanged. We reiterate our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating but also recognize the importance of maintaining our strong dividend and executing share repurchases from time to time.","With respect to our dividend, as Gary noted, our Board of Directors just increased our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share or an annualized rate of $1 per share. This reflects our confidence in our business and our expectations for continued strong cash flow generations. And on share repurchases, we purchased about $75 million of our shares in the fiscal first quarter. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $450 million of available share repurchase authorization.","And finally, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750-million debt issuance in 3 tranches of $250 million each of 3-year, 5-year and 10-year notes. The offering was very well received by the market, and we were able to secure some very attractive interest rates. We have used a portion of the proceeds to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings, and the balance will be used for general corporate purposes.","Now I'd like to share some comments on our fiscal 2013 outlook. As Gary mentioned, we have updated our full year earnings expectations for fiscal 2013 based upon our strong performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year. We now expect fully diluted earnings per share, adjusted for items impacting comparability, to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.06 or roughly 10% to 12% growth from our prior year base of $1.84 per share.","This update to our fiscal 2013 earnings estimate reflects net sales growth in the range of 7% to 8%, with sales growth for the Consumer Foods segment expected to be in the high single digits, primarily driven by our recent acquisitions. And in our Commercial Foods segment, we expect modest top line growth in the 3% range as volume, pricing and mix improvements in the segment are expected to be partially offset by the impact of lower wheat prices on our milling business. This fiscal 2013 estimate also reflects modest gross margin improvement in our Consumer Foods segment, driven by pricing and mix improvements and strong cost savings, partially offset by the impact of more moderate inflation.","While the commodity markets, especially grains, have been very volatile of late, we remain confident in our ability to effectively manage input costs and margins over the balance of the fiscal year.","On a related note, we recognized a large hedging gain this quarter that we treat as a comparability item, consistent with our normal practice. The gain offset previously accumulated losses, and the remaining net gain will be reclassified to operating segments as the underlying commodities are used in the business. To that point, we currently expect to reclassify about $35 million of this net gain to segment operating results in the remaining 3 quarters of fiscal 2013.","And for the full fiscal year, based on our assessment of input requirements and cost trends on these inputs, along with the hedging actions we've taken to manage risk, we now expect that our net inflation for this fiscal year will be slightly lower than our original estimate of mid-single digits. And as I noted previously for fiscal 2013, we continue to expect cost savings in excess of $240 million in our Consumer Foods business.","Also, we have budgeted a strong increase in marketing support this year, and that's in support of our long-term brand building initiatives. In the Commercial Foods segment, both our Lamb Weston and our flour milling businesses are positioned to perform well, although with more modest profit growth over the balance of the year.","Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 is expected to be in the range of 34% for the full year, although this rate may fluctuate somewhat quarter-to-quarter. And while we are confident in our capabilities and how we are executing against our strategic initiatives, we do expect more modest year-over-year earnings growth over the balance of the year, as the comps will get tougher, and we expect to continue to execute against a stronger investment plan in support of our brands to position our business for long-term success.","Overall, we're excited about the start of the fiscal year, and we're confident in our ability to deliver very attractive earnings growth for fiscal 2013.","That concludes our formal remarks. I want to thank you for your interest in ConAgra Foods. And Gary and I, along with Andr\u00e9 Hawaux and Paul Maass, will be happy to take your questions. I will now turn it back over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our session. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And it looks like our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A quick question about the full year guidance and acquisitions. I think last quarter, you had talked about acquisitions collectively contributing about half of the earnings relative to your previous full year guidance. Do you have an update to that now, particularly because you just recently closed on the Bertolli piece as well, which should, I would think, add to that?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew. First of all, we're very pleased with our integrations on all of the 6 acquisitions we've made in the last 12 months. I'd say that we would expect a little less than half of our Consumer Foods growth to come via acquisitions. We have a very disciplined process, a very clear strategy, and we're leveraging our capabilities to accelerate or improve the performance of the acquired businesses. So for example, as you mentioned, Bertolli and P.F. Chang will clearly benefit from our frozen infrastructure and scale in the section -- in the frozen section. And our best-in-class innovation capabilities will be directly applicable. But let me give it to John for a little more color.","John F. Gehring","Yes, Gary. Just, Andrew, just one clarification. I think as we entered the year, we said for the company, the acquisitions would contribute, we thought, maybe a little bit more than half. I think the full year, I would say that the acquisitions now for the total company will contribute slightly more than half. If we look at just at consumer, it might be a little bit more than half.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay, that's helpful, I appreciate it. And then, we've had a couple of food companies more recently start to see volume look a little bit less negative or start to gradually recover as the pricing component has started to wane. I realized at a corporate level for consumer, you still had quite a bit of pricing in the quarter, and hence, the volume elasticity. Are there any pieces of maybe the consumer business or particular brands that you can point to where the pricing on that brand has started to wane and you've seen volume trends that maybe make you feel somewhat comfortable that, again overall, as your pricing wanes, volume kind of comes back?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Andrew. You're accurate that we still had quite a bit of pricing to overlap in Q1, and that will change as the year goes on. But Andr\u00e9 can give us a bit more color.","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Andrew. Let me just answer the -- both parts of your question. First, with the pricing, which you talked about very succinctly, I'd say the way our pricing overlaps occur over the course of the year -- let me give you some percentages. We lapped about 40% of the price we took last year in Q1, so it is by far our biggest overlap. In Q2, we lap about 30% of it, so again, not insignificant. We had taken a lot of pricing, as you know, last year, and we had sequentially done it. But we had taken a fair amount in Q2, so that's about 30%. And then Q3, Q4, it's about 20% in Q3 and about 10% in Q4. So clearly, the back half certainly supports where we'll see a lot more of those volume trends. But as Gary mentioned earlier, we do see sequential improvements starting to happen in Q2 and Q3 and Q4. With respect to the brands that we've seen and feel very good about as pricing has waned, I'd say that one of the franchises we do feel good about and we're it seeing in our shares and we're seeing it behind the support that our advertising has given us, is probably on the Hunt's tomato products, specifically our diced portfolio. So we see ourselves coming into what is traditionally tomato season, and we're hoping we get a much -- a less mild winter than we got last year. But we see that brand doing very well on a market share standpoint and continuing to win with customers and consumers. So that would be one example I would give you of brands, other than the ones that Gary mentioned, obviously Marie Callender and Slim Jim and Ro*Tel and those brands.","Operator","We'll move now to JPMorgan's Ken Goldman.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Gary, I think you talked about the choice you made to favor of mix and margin over volume, at least to some extent for Banquet. And so far, that seems to be the right decision. I'm just curious how to think about maybe some of the risks that come along with this, though, because historically, Banquet's had the attractive price points, had a variety of SKUs such that it served sort of as a, I guess, quasi-private-label brand in the category. So what's the risk here that maybe your actions, though probably smart overall, maybe open up some parts of frozen to inroads from store brands where there aren't really any right now? And maybe you're willing to do that, right? And that's fine. I'm just curious how you think about that risk\/reward trade-off.","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, good question because we certainly do spend a lot of time working through that, and we think our analytics and our tools are far better than they've ever been. I would tell you, specifically on frozen, we're really not concerned too much about the store brand side of that because we've got such a strong frozen infrastructure, our scale and our productivity, what we've been able to do in terms of driving cost down in terms of the way we produce product. We believe it would be very difficult to significantly undercut a brand like Banquet, so we really don't believe that's a significant issue. It obviously is still a very tough environment, but we really do believe that once we get past this overlap, we'll start to see things moderate. We're not looking for heroics. We're talking about sequential improvement. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Yes, Ken, Gary is spot on about our frozen capabilities. I would also say, let's just remind ourselves, as the consumer looks at this, we still provide a high-quality protein, a starch and a vegetable, in many cases for a $1 in a meal, and that's unbelievable value. As you recall, a year ago, though, it was being sold for $0.88, and that was unsustainable from a margin perspective. So I think we -- I know we've made the right trade-offs. We haven't lost a lot of consumers in that franchise, and they will be back as we lap that pricing, as Gary said. So I think we feel very good about the decisions we've made on Banquet, and it continues to be a great value, a great traffic driver for our customers, a very good franchise we have. And we don't think private label comes in underneath that.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one more, if I can. You've done a bunch of acquisitions lately. Can you give us some color on which ones have exceeded expectations, which ones maybe a little -- maybe need a little bit more attention, so to speak, and what that tells you maybe about where you're thinking about going for future acquisitions? I mean, you made some in packaged meats, for example, sort of all over the store, if you will. And I'm just curious, any learnings you have that can help us understand perhaps how you're thinking about further acquisitions going forward?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes. We -- it's certainly really early in the process, so I would say we don't have any red flags at this point. We're very pleased with the way the integrations are going. Things take time to meld into our organization, and we're going to stay very true and disciplined on our strategy. We've got those 3 planks that you see us acting on: core adjacencies, private label and international. And we're going to stick with that. We've got, again, a very, very disciplined process. We're looking for both top and bottom line growth, and we're clearly sticking with that and have very tight filters and a lot of discussion before we move on opportunities.","Operator","And we'll move now to Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","Gary, I just had a question focused on the frozen entr\u00e9e category. It looks like the last acquisition you did with Unilever, with Bertolli and P.F. Chang's, if you break out the brands of P.F. Chang's, what you're -- mainly, it seems like mainly snacking\/Asian food based. The growth profile on those brands is just -- it's a lot better than kind of what we've seen in the frozen entr\u00e9e category. So I'm just curious if you could add some color as to why you think there is such growth basically in Asian-food frozen entr\u00e9e, one. And then two is, if there is growth in this subcategory, will you look to obviously expand that? And then by growing total dollar sales in the category, or would you look to potentially try to reduce your overall mix for some of your slower-growing SKUs?","Gary M. Rodkin","Well, we're very excited about the acquisition, both the P.F. Chang's side and Bertolli, because we believe, first of all, most importantly, those are terrific brand equities. They take us into new occasions, which as you noted, there's a bit of snacking, snack meals on the P.F. Chang's side. But really, this multi-serve side of the business is a place that we're very excited about getting bigger in. But those equities are really great, and I think the most important thing is that we have capabilities that can be leveraged because we've got scale, expertise, infrastructure in frozen that I think are going to be brought to bear once we really get this integrated into the company. So we are very excited about the growth prospects of both of those brands. They really hit the mark with some new consumers for us.","Operator","Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets has our next question.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Excluding -- I know you made a comment about this in the script, but I just wanted to be clear. Excluding acquisitions, which clearly came with some marketing spending themselves, how much on an apples-to-apples basis was marketing or advertising, however you're disclosing your spending, up roughly in this quarter?","John F. Gehring","Yes, this is John. The -- on the base consumer business, our advertising and promotion was up about 20% year-over-year on the comparable quarter.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Gary referred to strong increases for the year as a whole. I mean, what sort of order of magnitude would you expect that marketing to be up against the consumer portfolio for the year, relevant -- relative to your current plan?","Gary M. Rodkin","I'd say we're into the double digits.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And just finally, when you mentioned Hunt's, you commented to the tomato season as potentially responsive to a little bit more advertising spending. Is it your sense that ad spending has become less effective over the last couple of years? Because you've heard a lot of folks in the industry seem to indicate that maybe cutting ad spending is a little bit more rational given some of the consumer pressures out there. And what's your perspective on that? Has it become more or less effective? Any clear trend over the past couple of years?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Well, I think a lot of things have happened, Jonathan, over the course of the last couple of years with respect to how you access consumers from a variety of sources. The major -- the old 3-network programs that you did before don't work as well. But I think our teams have done a really nice job getting into the digital space, as Gary mentioned, with Slim Jim and some other things like that. I think you have to have a balance. And we were historically at ConAgra weighted to more push and trade-driven and less pull, and I think what we're doing, consistent with our strategy, has been to better balance that. But I do believe in this environment you need both. You need strong pull recognition, going for high ROI programs. And you also have to have merchandising and trade programs that bring consumers in and that support what the retailers are trying to do. So I think you have to have a balance. And I do believe the programs are still effective. Otherwise, if they weren't, if they had low ROIs, to Gary's point earlier, we would take them out.","Operator","We have a question now from KeyBanc Capital Markets, Akshay Jagdale.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I wanted to just clarify on the fiscal '13 guidance. So if I just take what you've said, I'm getting to -- base business growth guidance has increased from roughly, I would say, $0.06 in EPS growth year-over-year to about $0.09. I mean, first of all, I know -- if you don't want to be specific, at least, can you just say you have increased your base business guidance? Is that accurate?","John F. Gehring","Yes, that is accurate. I'd say we have increased our base business and the M&A piece has probably gone up a little bit, although I would caution that very recent acquisitions, we don't expect that those are going to be up and running at full run rates for some period of time. So the contribution of those to the current year is fairly minimal.","Akshay S. Jagdale - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the base business increase for the year, is that just a flow-through from this quarter? It seems as though it is. So in other words, you're not baking into your guidance a further increase in base business growth yet. Is that fair?","John F. Gehring","I think that's an accurate portrayal. We've essentially passed through the upside from this quarter, and then we've evaluated the rest of the year and feel like we're in the right spot.","Operator","We have a question now from David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First thing I'd like to do is just talk a little bit about the margins in Consumer Foods. You made the comment that the commodity cost, the raw material inflation came in slightly below the expectations. I suppose what I'm really trying to get is just an understanding. Three months ago, I feel like you guys had a very -- more cautious outlook. This is a tremendous report this morning. The margins are up enormously. Year-on-year growth are enormous numbers. Something happened within the 3-month window from the last call to this call. To me, it feels like it was the commodity side of it more than other pieces of it, specifically in Consumer Foods. But what's your take?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, David. First of all, again, let me reiterate how pleased I am with the quality of this Q1 performance, because both our Consumer and Commercial Foods operations significantly improved their operating profits. So very, very pleased with that. Now certainly, we benefited from less-than-expected inflation. Remember, we have to put our plans in place several months ahead, so that certainly contributed. But very importantly, our total margin management efforts across the company have really gotten traction, including our very proactive and effective cost management on top of lower-than-expected inflation. Our plants are also running very well across the company. Our productivity efforts continued to be robust, and our net pricing architecture tools and our analytics have really improved. And finally, our Lamb Weston international business was really strong. So all of the above, on top of just the lower inflation, added up to an excellent quarter.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So, Gary, the only follow-on I'd make to this one is that the pricing looks like it was a lot of carryover pricing and in line with our expectations. And on a full year basis, your productivity savings is roughly where you had thought it was before. So unless there's a pacing issue within the quarters, again, I'm only trying to understand 3 months ago versus today, and it's obvious this is a positive question, but it feels like the big delta was on the commodity side. I mean, am I just too -- am I wrong on this? Am I just being too strong on the commodity piece?","John F. Gehring","David, this is John. I think you're being slightly too strong on the commodity piece. I talked about mid-single digits last quarter. And I think I specified kind of 4% to 6%. When I say slightly better this quarter, probably talking about something in the 3% range. So while it was certainly helpful, there's a lot more to the story than just commodities here. So I think the things Gary mentioned, I think we're -- a lot of our capabilities were working very well. The other thing I'd add is that we expected the quarter to be a fair amount stronger than the prior year ourselves as we entered the year. So I think there is a lot of credit to pass around here in terms of number of capabilities.","Operator","We have a question now from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Some questions on the competitive dynamics out there in the industry. The frozen entr\u00e9es, the frozen case has been sluggish in terms of growth, and in a couple of your core categories we're now seeing some price investment by your key competitors. I think Nestl\u00e9's prices turned negative in frozen entr\u00e9es. Heinz has as well. And then in frozen potatoes, Heinz has been not so quiet about trying to get -- to win back market share with price investment and get retailers to concede some price as well on those brands. So can you talk a little bit about the level of aggression, how you see that playing out as we look forward?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Sure, I think we'll -- Jason, we'll tag team this, myself and Paul. Paul can speak to the potato piece, and I will speak to the category of single-serve meals, which I think you addressed with our competitor set there. We on occasion see that. I think that for the most part, people have been pretty disciplined, including ourselves, on pricing. But certainly, there are promotions out there that we see a little deeper than we'd like. But I'd say, on the whole, the key for us is to really bring consumers back and customers back to that category because that's what we've been -- what's been the most sluggish has been the offtake there. And again, a lot of that, and we've talked about this in the past, has a lot to do with the economy and some things like that. So I think we see that coming back. Right now, I don't see competitive prices sort of out of control, but on occasion, we do see promotions driven at a place where we would not rather not play.","Gary M. Rodkin","And you know Jason, clearly, we're not going to stick our head in the sand. We choose to try and drive the business much more with marketing and innovation, but if we need to surgically course correct here and there from a merchandising standpoint, we will certainly do that. That's not our priority, but certainly, we're going to be realistic about it. And on potatoes, Paul?","Paul T. Maass","Yes. I'd just reiterate what Gary mentioned in the formal remarks. There's nothing I'm seeing that would change our strategy and our commitment to this strategy with attracting the high-end consumers with Alexia and our all-natural innovative products with Alexia, as well as the licensed brands -- those are doing well -- and our long-term commitment with private label. And quarter-to-quarter, things may look a little bit different, but long term, everything that we see tells us to stick with our strategy.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One follow-up, if I can, on private label. There's been some chatter in this industry of retailers getting more aggressive on trying to put categories back out to bid to try to get some price concessions. Are you seeing that in the categories you compete in?","Paul T. Maass","Jason, for the most part, where we have the priority on private label is in more on the value-add side. But we're not looking to place most of our bets in categories where it's just purely about the lowest-price bid. That certainly will happen now and then and we have to deal with it, but our strategy is really to go on the value-add side.","Operator","Thilo Wrede with Jefferies has our next question.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Gary, a quick question for you. Last year, obviously, you made an attempt to buy a large private label maker. And since then, you've done several acquisitions, which in my view are -- were much more geared towards the branded side of the business. Is that a shift in focus? Is that a matter of availability? Can you just give us a little bit of color there?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, I would tell you that we're really doing all the above in terms of our 3 pillars. So you've seen us on the branded side, on things like most recently the Bertolli and PF Chang's. You see us in the private label space certainly with National Pretzel. And you've seen us on international with Del Monte Canada and with our increased position in our joint venture in India. So we really do have 3 pillars. It's not an either\/or. And we're going to continue down that path.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The private label -- the importance of private label to you hasn't changed at all.","Gary M. Rodkin","No, it hasn't. It is still a priority for us. It's really an important business. Again, we're interested in the value-added side of private label. Retailers clearly, you see, are interested in developing and improving their own store brands. And we've got a well-developed infrastructure on private label. And we're leveraging those capabilities that we have across the company on the branded side, like innovation and food safety and category management and just our overall talent. So we're going to continue to be a big branded player, but we see good growth opportunities in private label.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then the other question I have was just a housekeeping question. Of your new EPS guidance for fiscal '13, how much of that will be contributed by the non-consolidated business, the equity investment business?","Chris Klinefelter","Thilo, this is Chris. We don't usually single that out as a percentage of EPS. I think if you look at the current trends and the run rate, and assume that, that is something reasonable to prorate over the rest of the year.","Operator","Ann Gurkin with Davenport has our next question.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted just to circle back into frozen category and on meals. And in terms of the competitive landscape, are you seeing a step-up in the pace of innovation and the resulting attempt to drive pricing and margins and value through innovation? Any change in the strategy for both you and, I guess, competitors, sorry?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Ann, this is Andr\u00e9. Certainly for us, as Gary has mentioned, we believe we -- in frozen, we have an innovation machine. And not only with the recent properties we just acquired, we feel very good about the capabilities to innovate off of those 2 brands unbelievably well in multi-serve but also in other areas. But we've now sort of capture the frozen case, if you will, from -- I like to say from sunrise to sunset in the sense that we have it now at the breakfast occasion all the way through the dessert occasion. And we're looking at innovation across that entire lineup. We think we'll bring out some things for breakfast that will get consumers interested. And a lot of other things we continue to focus, as you know, on -- we showed some of those products at CAGNY on dessert. We know we have opportunities in single-serve and multi-serve meals, so we, for one, believe that we'll be driving the categories with our innovation machine that we have.","Gary M. Rodkin","And, Ann, I would echo Andr\u00e9's comment. The feedback we get consistently from our customers is that we are, by far, the best innovator, and we are doing things that are platform oriented, not really one-off. So if you think about our steaming, you think about our MicroRite trays that allow the consumer to get the same quality much more quickly out of a microwave versus an oven, those kinds of things are platforms that we'll continue to leverage.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if I could also ask about potential expansion or acquisitions. You highlighted you want to increase your international presence. Can you help me better understand? Would it be in adjacent categories? Would you enter a new space? Any geographies you're targeting? Any other details you can give me?","Gary M. Rodkin","Yes, Ann. I would say what we're not going to do is just plant a lot of flags. We're going to build out from the infrastructure in places that we already have pretty good scale. It could be places like India with our JV, places like Mexico, and we can grow not just in those companies but from that geography. And certainly, on the Lamb Weston side, where we already have a very significant global footprint, we're going to continue to grow as our customers continue with their aggressive plans to expand in emerging markets.","Operator","We'll move now to Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Actually, just following up on the -- we've moved into Lamb Weston here. You mentioned very strong Lamb Weston growth in international markets, and I think you just alluded to emerging markets. Can you tell us any more about which countries are particularly strong here, what kinds of outlets are working very well? And will the operating efficiencies that you mentioned this quarter continue to play out through the rest of the year?","Paul T. Maass","Sure. So I'll -- this is Paul, and I'll just kind of give you a broader perspective. So the way we look at it is there is pretty dynamic growth from emerging markets in general. The highest quality, lowest-cost potatoes in the world are in North America and Europe, which is exactly aligned with our footprint. And so we're well positioned to really align with customers and be key strategic partners that enable them to grow and build out their growth plans in these emerging markets. I would probably generalize as far as Southeast Asia as a real exciting growth market. But in general, we see a pretty exciting growth on frozen potato products in not only Asia, but also the Middle East and South America as well. And we're positioned well to enable those customers to grow there. And then on the operational efficiencies, I kind of hit on the quality of the potatoes and the low cost, but our manufacturing footprint can serve those customers very efficiently from where we're at. And we're very focused on that. It's a big part of what drives our success, and we're committed to that going forward.","Operator","We'll hear a question now from Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess just one specific question and then one broad-based one. John, you -- I guess you guys restated sales. Can you just go through that, the reasoning, what exactly that entailed? I realize it didn't impact profits. And then just, Gary, kind of stepping back, not to blindside you, but we -- you put a report out about this Prop 37 and the GMO labeling issue in California. You're pretty broad-based in the industry, and maybe you could shed some perspective on how you think the industry handles that and ConAgra specifically, if the vote goes against you.","John F. Gehring","Yes, Eric, let me handle the question on restating sales. We had a small portion of transactions in our milling business that just historically we've always reported on a net basis. And as we looked at the accounting rules and just looked to get the -- took another look at that, we decided it would be preferable, given how we report the rest of that business, just to report those sales gross. I believe it was about $30 million in the milling business in this quarter. So not material, but we just kind of cleaned it up.","Chris Klinefelter","Eric, this is Chris. In regard to your question about Prop 37, that's not the scope of our remarks today. So what I want to say is that we're working with our trade group and with other food companies to get the word out on it. And we think that when consumers understand the nature of the proposal, they'll vote against it, so...","Operator","And our last question will come from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","This is Rachel Nabatian in for Rob Moskow. So with a lower inflation outlook, what's your game plan for pricing? And given the better environment, do you expect to maybe even roll back prices in certain categories?","Andr\u00e9 J. Hawaux","Rachel, this is Andr\u00e9. I -- we don't see a need for that because, again, I just want to remind the listeners that it's still inflation that we're dealing with. It's certainly more moderate than it was a year ago, but it's still inflation. But as Gary pointed out earlier, I mean, we will watch where the categories go and where the competitive landscape takes us. But we don't see right now a need in our organization to be rolling back prices. We have a strategy across the full year, so but again, we'll be looking at it. We'll be looking at the commodity markets as we do day in and day out and determining what our posture is. But right now, our plans are not to see ourselves effectively roll back a lot of pricing.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Klinefelter, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks or closing comments.","Chris Klinefelter","Thank you. Just as a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. And as always, we are available for discussions.

This program is being recorded. My name is Gerry, and I will be your conference facilitator. All audience lines are currently in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I\u2019d like to introduce your host from ConAgra Brands for today\u2019s program; Sean Connolly, Chief Executive Officer; Dave Marberger, Chief Financial Officer; and Johan Nystedt, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Nystedt.","Johan Nystedt","Good morning. During today\u2019s remarks, we will make some forward-looking statements. And while we\u2019re making those statements in good faith and are confident about our Company\u2019s directions, we do not have any guarantee about the results that we will achieve.","So, if you would like to learn more about the risks and factors that could influence and impact our estimated results, perhaps materially, I\u2019ll refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, which include cautionary language. Also we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures during the call today, and the reconciliations of those measures to the most directly comparable measures for Regulation G compliance can be found in either the earnings press release, or in the earnings slides, both of which can be found on our Web site at conagrabrands.com\/investor-relations.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Sean.","Sean Connolly","Thanks, Johan. Good morning, everyone, happy holidays. And thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2017 conference call. We\u2019re excited to be with you this morning for our first call as ConAgra Brands, with the spin-off of Lamb Weston successfully behind us we have embarked on a new era as a branded pure-play CPG company. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress to get to this point. But more importantly, we\u2019re confident that we have a lot of run-way to deliver significant improvement and profitability in the years to come.","On today\u2019s call, I\u2019m going to take few minutes to provide some context around where we are and our expectations going forward. I\u2019ll also touch on the progress we\u2019re making against our strategic plans. I\u2019ll cover a few highlights from the quarter and Dave will get into the details before we take your questions. For those of you who are able to join us at our Investor Day in October, you will recall that I left you with six key takeaways about the business and our plans for the future. First, we have clearly moved to beyond our roots as an ad company, and later a global conglomerate.","ConAgra Brands today is a much different organization. And as we discussed with you in October, the differences aren\u2019t just structural. Our culture has fundamentally evolved. The team has developed the focus and discipline required to succeed. Hand-in-hand with these cultural changes, the revenue management capabilities we\u2019ve developed and the deep commitment to cost and complexity reduction efforts now embedded in our organization. We expect these efforts will fuel additional margin expansion overtime, which in-turn will fuel improved growth and cash flow. It\u2019s also worth repeating that we\u2019re in a unique position to reshape our portfolio in an efficient manner. We have a strong balance sheet, and an attractive tax asset.","Overtime, we can leverage both in a disciplined manner to drive additional growth and maximize value. We have driven a lot of change in our organization, and we won\u2019t stand still. But as I\u2019ve said before, as we continue to implement changes, we will do so in an orderly, thoughtful, and patient manner. We will continue to move with urgency, but our efforts will require time and investments.","Moving to slide seven, our actions will continue to be guided by the five portfolio management principles that I introduced on our Q1 call, and that Tom and Darren described in detail at our Investor Day. We will stay focused on; number one, upgrading the volume base; two, refreshing our core; and three, the clear roles we\u2019ve assigned to the brands within our portfolio via our rigorous portfolio segmentation process. We will also; four, ramp-up innovation and disciplined M&A; and five, effectively back our winners with proper A&P and trade investment.","Make no mistake, we intent to grow. But we will do so in a manner that is profitable and drive shareholder value. Our PMPs will continue to guide us in that regard. We\u2019ve already made significant progress in shifting our approach to managing the portfolio. The segmentation we described at Investor Day, shown here on slide eight, reflects the renewed focus we have brought to our brands. We have grouped each brand into one of four categories. We invigorate, accelerate growth, reliable contributors and then grow core and extend.","This framework guides our investment priorities, particularly around A&P and innovation. And as we discussed at our Investor Day, it provides the lens for our SKU optimization efforts, which is really a broad based initiative, focused on eliminating a long-tail of SKUs that add-up to a small amount of volume and weak margins. This effort is important to driving improved overall profitability, and has been recognized and commended by our customers, particularly our early efforts on brands like Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice.","Moving to slide nine, we are clear-eyed that our success will require us to break a number of bad habits, and we are making meaningful progress. We are moving from a focus on volume at any cost to a focus on value creation. From a reliance on trade driven push tools to a reliance on stronger brands, stronger innovation, and consumer pull. As I just mentioned, we\u2019re shifting away from SKU proliferation to optimizing our SKUs with a focus on sustainable returns. And we\u2019re continuing to make strides in our approach to A&P, which is now more focused, consistent, and tied to ROIs.","Our focus on the fundamentals is translating into results. As you can see on slide 10, it was another quarter of progress. We continued to execute our strategy of building a higher quality revenue base, consistent with portfolio management principle number one. The headline on net sales is 11.5% decline. But I want to call your attention to the next line where we note the 5.5% of estimated impact of divestitures and foreign exchange.","Our net sales were down as a result of the actions we\u2019re taking to optimize our portfolio, and drive our value-over-volume strategy to upgrade our revenue base. Adjusted operating profit was up 11.6%, driven by strong gross margin expansion, improved mix, more efficient pricing and trade, and continued SG&A savings. This resulted in a 350 basis-point increase in adjusted operating margins to 17%.","We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $0.49 for the quarter, up 26% from the prior year\u2019s quarter, driven by operating income growth and lower interest expense. It\u2019s worth noting that our bottom line reflects core operating performance that was slightly ahead of our expectations, offset by weaker than expected performance from our Ardent Mills JV. Ardent has been negatively impacted by a broader set of market dynamics in the milling industry.","To illustrate the point on value over volume, slide 11 shows some of the information that Tom McGough first shared at our Investor Day. The chart on the left shows that we\u2019ve been willing to walk away from lower ROI promotional activities and thus, our incremental volume sales have significantly declined as planned. We began to reduce our reliance on promotions during the second quarter and third quarter last year, so we will soon be lapping these results.","The chart on the right shows a steady increase in base sales velocity trends, which illustrates that our efforts are working to build a stronger foundation as core consumers are staying with our brands.","Looking ahead at our margins, looking at our margins, we are clearly making progress. Versus last year\u2019s Q2, we have driven 250 basis-points of gross margin improvement, behind our pricing and trade promotion discipline, supply chain productivity, as well as some input costs favorability. While our second quarter has traditionally delivered a higher margin, we are confident that we will be able to sustain the improvement and hit our gross margin guidance for the year.","On the right side of the slide, you can see our operating margin improvements. Helping this number is the fact that our SG&A optimization efforts have come in quicker than we anticipated. In the back half of the year, we will continue our efforts to invest new capabilities at our brands and thus, we expect operating margins to fall in line with our guidance. While we\u2019re pleased with our margin results to-date, we know there is more we can do from here. Our game-plan is to grow the center line of our profitability over time. We understand that there is a standard deviation from quarter-to-quarter, but we\u2019re taking a longer term view. We\u2019re focused on the center line, and we continue to see room to grow.","Our gross margin progress reflects our ability to quickly capture some of the low-hanging fruit we identified early on. Looking ahead, there are no major structural issues preventing us from delivering further improvement, so we will continue to chip-away that opportunity. Another opportunity we\u2019re focused on is successfully expanding into on-trend categories. The Frontera acquisition is a great example. It opens up an opportunity to capitalize on the rapid growth in Gourmet Mexican Cuisine. It has been a pleasure working with Rick Bayless, and the integration process is moving forward according to plan.","Turning to slide 15, as we move forward to the remainder of fiscal 2017 and beyond, we will continue to execute against our portfolio management principals. In the second half of fiscal 2017, we\u2019ll be lapping last year\u2019s pricing actions and expect to see corresponding improvement in our top-line trend as we continue to expand our margins. Our innovation progress is also accelerating, and we expect to see our new products hit the market in early fiscal 2018. And as I just said, we will continue to chip-away at the gross margin opportunity, while we deliver profitable growth.","And finally, we will look to continue to reshape our portfolio. This may include exiting brands in an efficient matter, using our tax assets. It will also include augmenting our current portfolio through a disciplined approach to M&A. We still have a lot of work to do, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. We are confident that the plans we have in motion are the right ones to drive improved consistency and profitability at ConAgra, and long-term value for our shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to Dave, I want to thank our talented, dedicated ConAgra Brands\u2019 employees, who continued to do a tremendous job, serving our customers and executing our strategy. I\u2019m grateful for all you do, and wish all of you a happy holiday season. Now, over to you, Dave.","Dave Marberger","Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone and happy holidays. Slide 17 outlines a few key points related to our basis of presentation. Lamb Weston and related joint ventures are now reclassified as discontinued operations. The commercial reporting segment for the second quarter and ongoing will have no current operating results. It will only include the historical results for Spicetec and J. M. Swank.","Please note that references to adjusted items refer to measures that exclude items impacting comparability, and reconcile to the growth closest GAAP measure and tables that are included in the earnings release and in the presentation deck. The Spicetec and J. M. Swank businesses, which were divested in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 are included in the historical results, and are not called out as items impacting comparability.","Moving to slide 18, reported net sales for the second quarter were down 11.5% compared to a year ago. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 3.6% versus the second quarter a year ago; as gross margin improvement was more than offset by volume declines on favorable FX, and the sale of the Spicetec and J. M. Swank businesses. Adjusted gross margin was 31.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 250 basis-points compared to a year ago. This increase was driven by supply-chain costs reductions and productivity gains, and improvements in pricing and trade efficiency.","Adjusted operating profit increased 11.6% due to the large reduction in SG&A, which offset the gross profit dollar decline. I will discuss SG&A in more detail shortly. Importantly, adjusted operating margin was 17% for the second quarter, up 350 basis-points from the second quarter a year ago due to the gross margin improvements and SG&A reductions. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 for the second quarter, up 26% from the prior year due to significant SG&A reductions and lower interest expense.","Slide 19 shows the drivers of our second quarter net sales change versus a year ago; total net sales were down 11.5%; divestitures and FX negatively impacted net sales by 5.5%; volume declines contributed 7% of the decrease, partially offset by a 1% improvement in price mix and trade productivity.","Slide 20 highlights our continued strong SG&A performance, resulting from the restructuring we started in fiscal year 2016. Note that this chart represents adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P expense. A&P is included as part of SG&A on the face of the financial statements. Adjusted SG&A was down 21% in the second quarter versus a year ago. And for the first half of fiscal year 2017, adjusted SG&A was down $129 million or 25%. SG&A, as a percentage of net sales, was 9.5% for the second quarter and was 9.8% for the first half of fiscal year 2017.","In the second quarter, we continued to benefit from timing on certain SG&A expenses, which we expect to hit in the second half of fiscal year 2017; having said that, we are pleased with our first-half SG&A performance, as we are realizing our cost savings goals a bit faster than we planned.","Moving to slide 21, this chart outlines the drivers of EPS improvement from $0.39 in the second quarter year ago to $0.49 this quarter, which is a 26% increase. As we expected, the EPS impact of the volume decline was offset by the gross margin expansion from supply chain cost reductions and productivity gains, as well as pricing and trade efficiency improvements. The supply chain gains represented approximately two-thirds of the gross margin increase, while pricing and trade represented one-third. Negative FX from the weakening of the Mexican peso and the divestiture of Spicetech and J. M. Swank were more than offset by the EPS benefit of SG&A cost reductions and interest expense declines due to lower debt.","Slide 22 highlights the net sales and adjusted operating profit by reporting segment. In our grocery and snacks segments, net sales were $854 million for the quarter, down 6%, reflecting a 7% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix. Adjusted operating profit $was 222 million in the quarter, an increase of 18%. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects continued progress on gross margin expansion, reduced SG&A costs, and lower A&P spending, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes. In our refrigerated and frozen segment, net sales were $740 million for the quarter, down 10.5%, reflecting an 11.4% decline in volume and a 1% improvement in price mix.","Adjusted segment operating profit was $120 million in the second quarter, down 7.5%. The decrease reflects continued progress on margin expansion efforts that were more than offset by volume declines and the impact of benefits in the prior year\u2019s quarter from avian flu related higher volume and sales for Egg Beaters. Our Egg Beaters products supply was not impacted as a result of the avian flu outbreak, creating the sales opportunity in the prior year quarter.","In our international segment, net sales were $211 million for the quarter, down 4.5%. This reflects a 2.5% decline in volume, a 2% improvement in price mix, and a negative 4% impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted segment operating profit was $18 million in the second quarter, down 17%, driven primarily by the negative impact of the weakening Mexican peso. Reported segment operating profit includes a $44 million pre-tax impairment charge to goodwill due to the impact of the weakening peso on our business in Mexico.","In our Food Service segment, net sales were $283 million for the quarter, down 1%. Adjusted operating profit was $32 million in the second quarter, an increase of 56% versus a year ago. The net sales results reflect a decrease in sales from exiting a non-core food service snack business. The adjusted segment operating profit increase was primarily due to a one-time inventory write-down cost incurred in the year ago quarter for the business we exited.","As mentioned earlier, there were no sales or adjusted operating profits in the commercial segment this quarter, given the Spicetec and J. M. Swank divestitures and the reclassification of the Lamb Weston business to discontinued operations.","Slide 23 summarizes select cash flow and balance sheet information for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 versus the year ago period. We ended the second quarter with $3.5 billion of total debt and approximately $1.4 billion of cash on hand. This results a net debt of approximately $2 billion with no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. In the first half, total debt was reduced by approximately $2 billion. As we have stated in the past, we remain committed to an investment grade credit rating for the business. We had capital expenditures of $118 million for the first half for the 2017 versus $110 million in the comparable year period.","As previously announced, the Board of Directors approved its first dividend since the completion of the spin-off of the Lamb Weston business on November 9, 2016. A quarterly dividend payment of $0.20 per share will be paid on March 01, 2017 to stockholders of record, as of the close of business on January 30, 2017.","During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of stock at a cost of approximately $85 million. Approximately 300,000 of these shares were repurchased before the spin-off. In addition, I want to note the following items related to corporate or total Company performance. Equity method investment earnings were $17 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the prior year due to the Company\u2019s Ardent Mills joint venture performing below expectations due to market conditions. Adjusted corporate expenses were $36 million for the second quarter versus $54 million a year ago, reflecting the benefits from our cost savings efforts.","Advertising and promotion expense for the quarter was $97 million, down 9%. Advertising and promotion, as a percentage of net sales, was approximately 4.7% for the second quarter, up from 4.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $54 million in the second quarter versus $79 million a year ago due to the pay-down of debt during the past 12 months. For the second quarter, foreign exchange negatively impacted net sales by $9 million, and operating profit by $6 million versus the year ago quarter.","Lastly, the second quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. The effective tax rate was slightly lower than planned due to reduce tax expense related to stock compensation expense. I will now briefly summarize the items impacting comparability this quarter; approximately $0.03 per diluted share of net expense or $20 million pre-tax related to restructuring plans; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $61 million pre-tax related to extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the Lamb Weston spin-off; approximately $0.09 per diluted share of net expense or $44 million pre-tax related to an impairment of goodwill in the Mexican business; and approximately $0.02 per diluted share of net expense related to tax items associated with the Spicetec and J. M. Swank divestitures.","Slide 24 summarizes our full-year of fiscal 2017 financial outlook, which is the same outlook we provided at Investor Day in October. As we communicated at Investor Day, this outlook was based upon a pro forma fiscal year 2016 P&L base, which excluded the Lamb Weston and J. M. Swank, and Spicetec results. Lamb Weston is now included in discontinued operations, and is excluded from the ConAgra Brands historical information. However, J. M. Swank and Spicetec are not accounted for as discontinued operations. So those results are included in the historical financial information for ConAgra Brands.","As quick noted on this chart, if you include the J. M. Swank and Spicetec net sales this fiscal year 2017 net sales outlook is minus 8.5% to minus 9.5%. To be clear, this is not a change in our outlook. We just wanted to provide you with the additional detail of the fiscal year 2017 outlook with Spicetec and J. M. Swank included.","So, in summary, ConAgra Brands continues to make progress upgrading our volume base. Gross margins are expanding, and our SG&A cost reduction program is progressing well. Our balance sheet is strong and gives us the flexibility to evaluate various opportunities to drive shareowner value. And our outlook for fiscal year 2017 remains unchanged as we start the second half.","Thank you. This concludes my formal remarks. Sean, Tom McGough and I, will be happy to take your questions. I will now pass it back to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, we\u2019d like to get to an important part of today\u2019s call, taking your questions. The question-and-answer session will be concluded by the telephone [Operator Instructions]. And it looks like our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Sean, I know that in past conference calls, I think you\u2019ve talked about how something around six brands or so were accounting for 80% or so of the volume decline. And to the best of our ability in tracking some of the recent scanner data, or more recent scanner data by brand, it just seems like the volume declines have broadened out maybe to a much broader set of brands across the portfolio, even some of those that are in the accelerating growth sort of quadrant. So I just want to get a sense of, is that something that you see in your data? And if so what brings that about, and is it consistent with the expectation obviously that volume trends look start to improve in the back half of the fiscal year?","Sean Connolly","Andrew let me start that, and Tom if I miss any granular detail here, feel free to chime-in. What we\u2019re seeing is pretty much exactly what we expect to see. Our actions are, in fact, broad based and largely around promotion and pricing. But I think big picture, clearly, we\u2019re out to transform this Company, unlock value, and for some time now, we\u2019ve been very proactive in communicating that we need to change some of our legacy practices, and walk away from some of the low margin volumes that those practices had embedded in our base.","And we\u2019re doing that and it is working. And big picture, we\u2019re focused on unlocking margin potential. And for that to happen, it is a mandate that we change our practices across our brands and upgrade our volume base, and ramp-up an improved brand building and innovation capability. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And I do like what I see, and in the back half, you will see trends improve. In fact, as the most recent takeaway data shows, that\u2019s already beginning to happen. But I do want to remind everybody that this is not a slip of a switch, this is a process and we\u2019re going to manage it overtime. But it\u2019s definitely going to benefit shareholders. In terms of any other particulars, Tom, you\u2019re still very largely concentrated, you want to add any color to that?","Thomas McGough","Just a couple of things, as you highlighted, we are taking very focused and disciplined approach to price the brands that were underpriced, over-promoted. And it also includes proactively optimizing our SKU mix. What you see is that we\u2019re upgrading our volume base, one that is plus promotionally driven, higher margin. And as you highlighted in your chart, the fundamental base sales velocity performance is improving on the portfolio.","So, when you look at Q2, in particular, there is a couple of things that are somewhat unique. First, Egg Beaters is -- our foot in the refrigerated segment includes Egg Beaters. In the year ago period, there was a sales benefit associated with the avian flu impact, where our supply was relatively unaffected from that. The second thing that\u2019s unique is Q2 of last year was a significant promotional period for us on our premium yield brands, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Bertolli. That is part of our trade promotion productivity, is to optimize that spending, and we\u2019ll begin to lap those as we move into the second half of our fiscal year.","And then the third component would be supply issues. At the beginning of the quarter, we still had some residual impact from PF chains. Recall that it showed-up in lower merchandizing at the beginning of the quarter. And then at the end of the quarter, there was an industry issue on Reddi-wip -- industry issue on nitrous oxide this impacted Reddi-wip. So, overall -- so we\u2019re fundamentally on track, building and upgrading our volume base.","Andrew Lazar","So thank you for that color. And then just as a follow-up would be, the EBIT decline in refrigerated and frozen, even excluding the benefit last year are from Egg Beaters and avian flu was still lower year-over-year. So, I\u2019m just trying to make sure, I understand how that lower EBIT would be consistent obviously with the plan around upgrading volume and the expectation that brings about better margin and profitability. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","I\u2019ll defer back to Andrew\u2019s question.","Sean Connolly","We finish the point on Andrew. Andrew, the actions we are taking in Refrigerated & Frozen that you\u2019ve got some weird things in there like the windfall benefit we had last year on Egg Beaters and things like that that didn\u2019t repeat this year, but we are discontinuing significant both activities and SKUs that have some profitability associated with it. But frankly, it\u2019s fundamentally not up to our margin standards. And we are going to continue to do that, that\u2019s all part of resetting our volume base and create the right foundation build up in the future. Dave?","Dave Marberger","And just add one thing at this the impact of ready what there were some costs that did effect operating, adjusted operating profit as well. So, we factor in both the Egg Beaters and the cost from Reddi-wip, you\u2019re pretty about flat in terms of operating profit on the sales decline. ","Johan Nystedt","All right. Matt, over to you.","Matthew Grainger","All right. Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. Thanks for the question. From a supply chain perspective, you've highlighted some of the gross margin favorability being driven by productivity favorable input costs. I\u2019m just curious relative to the algorithm you laid out at the Investor Day with 3% plus realized productivity, 2% inflation. How those benchmarks compared to where we are in the first half of this year? And then, on the realized productivity, how far or long are you in the process of being able to achieve those new bench marks consistently? Are we already there or we working toward it?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I would say we are -- the supply chain team continues to do a great job. They\u2019ve got, as Dave Biegger pointed out on Investor Day, a very strong track record and they\u2019re not satisfied with that, they think they can do more and it\u2019s not -- we are not going to get there overnight. But we are well on our way. I\u2019d say we are spot on with where we expect to be, any other color Dave?","Dave Biegger","Yes. So, as I mentioned about two thirds of the gross margin improvement was driven by supply chain, we did guide, I think our long-term guidance on inflation was 2.3%, it\u2019s less -- it's around 1% for fiscal year 2017. So, as Sean said, we are on track with the realized productivity. We are benefitting from a pretty benign inflation, environment currently, although at Investor Day, we expected higher inflation in the half year. So, we are on track.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thanks. And just one more question, Sean, in terms of the promotional environment, you\u2019re obviously still very focused on moving path some of last year\u2019s less productive activity. But in the few other categories like frozen meals, we\u2019ve seen some evidence of more competitive promotion in recent months. Just curious for you observations there whether you\u2019re running into anything that would make it more challenging to follow through on what you\u2019ve intended to do without seeing a little bit more pronounced competitive impact?","Sean Connolly","No, I think you\u2019re always going to see some differences regionally, you\u2019ll see some differences by customers in terms of behaviors and whether or not they are trying to go to more than every day low price or a high low environment. I would say overall, guys; since I've been here it's been fairly rational. We'll have to continue to monitor, are there spikes or pockets of irrationality. And we will defend our business as we need to because we need to continue to make sure that our market share is a competitive. But on average, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s been pretty reasonable and we just monitor this very carefully and take the actions we need to take.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Driscoll.","Weill Cornell","Good morning. This is Weill Cornell in with the few questions for David. First one is just looking at kind of where you\u2019re at so far this year, nice feature relative to the consensus in the first two quarters. Why hasn't the maybe the top end of guidance gone up for the full year, and if I could really hone in here, I\u2019m looking at an operating margin of 17% in the second quarter realized there is some seasonality here. But, the guidance kind of implied an operating margin of 14.5 over the balance of the year. So, it seems like trough while some what we're running at. And just kind of wanted to know, what are the factors that play into these numbers?","Sean Connolly","Yes, let me give you my true senses on that and Dave can way into. Clearly, I am very pleased with our margin progress. We have harvested some low-hanging fruits. We\u2019re in a benign inflationary environment, and we\u2019re benefiting from some timing and SG&A is, our transition increased from short-term vacancies. And as Dave pointed out, we need to sustain these margins in the back half and then our top-line trends to hit our guidance. And I\u2019m very confident, we\u2019ll do just that. But two months post Lamb spent, it's still early days. So, we\u2019re standing by our previous guidance and staying very focused on continuing to execute well.","Weill Cornell","Okay. And lastly, I\u2019m sorry.","Dave Marberger","No, I think you've covered it, right.","Weill Cornell","Okay, great. And then lastly just one on kind of some of the advertising and consumer promotion spending, I think you said there might have been a shift in that in the quarter. So just wondering kind of back half what this A&P spending look like. Is it flattish with upward or is it down and kind of what\u2019s the full year outlook for A&P spending?","Sean Connolly","Let me give you how I think about A&P. Our A&P was down in the quarter, but take a look at the absolute rate. I think we\u2019re about 4.7%, that is a very healthy level of A&P in my book. So, I feel good about that and we\u2019ve continued to find inefficiency in our previous A&P spent and just like in place also in our portfolio, if we can get inefficiency out we do it. We also like to line up our A&P with when we have important in market activities. So, as you can imagine with our new innovations coming out in early Q1 of next year, we\u2019re going to have some momentum that we\u2019ve got to build going into that. So, you\u2019ll see a good A&P investment from us in the back half without getting into granular detail there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.","Chris Growe","I have two questions, if I could. Somewhat a little bit on Cornell's question there on A&P. I guess related to that there has been some SG&A related spending is been kind of deferred to the second half of the year. Is that A&P or there is more than just A&P in that? And maybe related to that in the first quarter, like you've mentioned maybe something around $30 million of SG&A that kind of push through the back half and that still a good number that would apply to the back half of the year?","Sean Connolly","Let me give you a little insight on that. So, the SG&A that we talked about that I went through exclude A&P. So, when you see SG&A on face of the financial statements A&P is in that, but we\u2019re talking about separately here. So, in the first half, we were favorable on SG&A. We have open positions that we\u2019re continuing to feel. We\u2019re building our capabilities here, and so if we make progress in the second half there that will clearly increase our SG&A percentage. And then, there is some important projects internally that are really backend weighted. So when you look at, we\u2019re going to be closer to the target for SG&A that we talked about at Investor Day at 10.8% of sales. So, that\u2019s kind of how we look at, if the second half related to SG&A excluding A&P. I think Sean covered the A&P piece of that we look at the second half.","Chris Growe","Okay. That\u2019s great, thank you. And then just a quick question for you on mix improvement and just understand if you have positive price mix. Is that mostly related to lower promotional spending and more efficient spending? And is mix really benefitting the top line at this point or is that more associated with innovation in the future?","Thomas McGough","Chris, this is Tom McGough. Our pricing is really a combination of couple of things. One, we were taking pricing where we\u2019ve done product upgrades whether that\u2019s been Banquet or introducing more value added, Healthy Choice simply steamers. A large component of the pricing benefit has been on trade promotion productivity, primarily on our premium meals businesses as well as many other brands within grocery. And as you look at our resources, we do apply those on our segmentation on those accelerated businesses that tend to be stronger in terms of profitability.","Sean Connolly","Chris, this is Sean here. One other bit of perspective that I think is helpful for people to because sometimes I get the question why not more mix impact for margin accretive innovation faster, why not more gross margin faster? As we innovate particularly when we go into adjacencies as you look at our segmentation, in some case before, and so we built the success model in the marketplace and having empirical evidence that the new innovation is going to work, we may go to a co-packer, and then we do that because we don\u2019t commit capital upfront. Then once we\u2019ve got the evidence that it\u2019s a successful innovation, we\u2019ve repatriated. We'll invest the capital, we'll bring in house. So at sometimes you got a bit of a gross margin headwind on kind of breakthrough new innovations in the early days until you prove it you. But that is weakening the right way to having done this for a long time to manage innovation because you don\u2019t always hit them all out of the park, you have some hits and you have some misses, and you want to be judicious on capital investment in support of new innovation.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will hear from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. Just looking at our own Nielsen data for ConAgro, it looks like in the last four or five months that both base non-promoted sales have contributed to the sales declines in addition to that incremental, and that\u2019s probably one of the reasons that base deteriorating is why that the overall volume decline is accelerated. You have that one slide, I think at Slide 11 where you show base velocity is actually accelerating, and I am trying to reconcile those two things and perhaps there is a point there about loss of distribution or SKU cutbacks that can sort of explain the base trends and what you\u2019re trying to do?","Sean Connolly","David, Sean here. At Investor Day, we talked a bit about the mastering complexity project that we are working, and we\u2019ve also talked about unwinding some legacy practices. One of those legacy practices is SKU proliferations. So, guys correct me if I am wrong here, but I think the quote I had at Investor Day was something like the last 20% of our volume account for roughly 70% of our SKUs, something like that. So, we have a lot of complexity and a lot of scheme proliferation that\u2019s not adding up to a lot of volume, and as you might imagine on shelf, it doesn\u2019t add up to a lot of productivity. So, we don\u2019t want to have working capital of items like that sitting around our warehouses, we\u2019ve got to clean that up and we\u2019ve been very proactively doing that and you see that in some of the distribution trends, but when you do that as you can imagine, what remains is higher velocity stuff. So, you see a going opposite effect usually of improvement of velocity and that\u2019s we\u2019ve been looking for and that\u2019s pretty much exactly what we are seeing.","David Palmer","And do you think that velocity is a leading indicator for those base trends and other words, do you see an end to these SKU rationalization drag as such that we are going to see base trends start to improve sequentially from here?","Sean Connolly","Yes, I mean you\u2019ve got a mix of things going on is what I call base drivers. I think when you take out the SKU that\u2019s a negative base driver. When you increase price that\u2019s a negative base driver, but conversely, when you have effective A&P and effective innovation that\u2019s positive base driver. So, this is a process for us kind of continuing to upgrade this volume base, a lot of what we are doing at certain brands will be through this year. There are other brands as we talk about at Investor Day with respect to mastering complexity that we won't even get to the next year. So, I think the picture the way to think about is instead of getting overly exercise around the optics of the top line trend, setback and think about whether or not there is real value associated with that volume to begin with. Because if there is not value associated with it, there is not margin associated with it, frankly all it\u2019s giving us, is optics and that\u2019s not what we are in business for, we are in value creation.","Operator","Thank you so much. And we will move on to Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rob Moskow","Hi, thanks. This might be just another way of asking the same question, but when you get into fiscal \u201918 and \u201919, Sean, I think a lot of this will modeling positive sales for those two years, but you know the environment is weaker than anybody though and you\u2019re taking some pretty aggressive actions to upgrade your volume. So there is a model still work to get to double-digit EPS growth, if say sales are down in \u201918 and that\u2019s really the question. Can you still get there even if it\u2019s down?","Sean Connolly","Yes, the sales guidance we gave was really a CAGR that take us through 2020. And so, I wouldn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think we haven\u2019t really thought about it as a straight line, as you all know this is a -- we have a big portfolio. We got to attack these things in chunks and we are making tremendous progress doing it. So, we feel really good about our algorithm. We feel good about the EPS guidance. There will be different drivers each year depending upon how far we are in the program. But we feel great about the guidance including at EPS, I guess as how I put it.","Operator","Thank you so much. And our next question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Let me ask about the percentage of sales from these products. You talked a lot about innovation taking in at the beginning of fiscal \u201918. Where are you now in terms of percentage of sales the new products either institutes in the last year or three year, however you measure that? And where you hope to get to overtime and how quickly can you get there without that innovation?","Sean Connolly","Historically, we\u2019ve been at call it 9% level, roughly in that ballpark. We\u2019ve made some progress against that. We put a couple of few points on top of that we call it renewal rate. We want to get to 15, but as you might imagine, rebuilding the innovation pipeline takes a longer than say taking out costs. So one of the reasons why we got just so aggressive on costs in the early days of this transformation is, we\u2019re grounded in a clear eyed recognition that rebuilding innovation pipe does take longer. So, it\u2019s been important to us to get it some of these low-hanging fruit cost opportunities early on while we repopulate the innovation. And we already doing it as I said, we\u2019ve moved from 9 to call it 12, and it will continue to ramp up from here. Importantly, it\u2019s also got to be, it's proverbial fewer, bigger, better idea. But for us, that\u2019s particularly important given our track record of proliferating so many key little SKUs, and we\u2019re working in that because we want shelf efficiency for every item we could out there for our customers.","Alexia Howard","Great, and there is a follow-up, you talk in the prepared remarks about portfolio changes kind of alluding to the possibility of divestment, so using the tax assets and then maybe exhibitions as well. How aggressively are you feeling also those type of opportunities at presence and what are the criteria because using on either side of the scale to sales to think about what divestment maybe what to go offset? Thank you. I\u2019ll now pass it on.","Sean Connolly","Yes. Good question. The backdrop to always that of course is that we are a portfolio of reshape story that means we need the strength in the businesses we have. We also need to bring in businesses that will be complementary, and we have the unique ability to efficiently divesting, if we conclude that they don\u2019t say or they\u2019re more valuable to somebody else. So, this is an important part of our value maximization strategy, it\u2019s leveraging our balance sheet properly and as a strategic leveraging our capital loss carry forwards. So we\u2019re always in a position of readiness, should we see something that we can say confidently makes good strategic sense and makes good financial sense. And that just really principally how we look at it, I don\u2019t think in detail to getting share beyond that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of housekeeping items. I guess first is interest expense this quarter is about 54 million. Is that a good run rate, we should think about going forward or is there anything sort of unusual noise on the interest expense line this quarter?","Dave Marberger","Bryan, no, because we pay down debt during the quarter, the run rate is actually lower in the second half. So you should look at where we are with debt, where we end of the quarter as sort of the base to use.","Bryan Spillane","In terms of where the debt at the end of the quarter at the base use?","Dave Marberger","Yes. That\u2019s right.","Bryan Spillane","And what rate should we be using?","Dave Marberger","It used 5%, 5.5%.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then second question in terms of share repurchases, I think it\u2019s a 170 million year-to-date and you were targeting I think 1 billion for 2017. So is that still the expectation that we should be using going forward?","Dave Marberger","Yes. Let me just clarify that a little bit because looking at the numbers that may not be clear. At Investor Day, we announced plans to purchase of $1 billion worth of shares, and under a new $1.25 billion authority that we initiated after the spin-off was completed in November. So, when you look at the second quarter, there is only about half a month where we\u2019re actually repurchasing under that authority. So that was about $70 million. So, $70 million for half a month is kind of the run rate on the share repurchase. So, that\u2019s the plan kind of going forward.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then the last one, you spent that all you can help in terms of savings 3Q, 4Q in the second half. I know, there is, it sounds like there is going to be some moving part in terms of like when we should start to see the top line effective lapping the big pricing actions last year maybe where the SG&A starts to com in that\u2019s what you didn\u2019t say in the first half that will come into the second half. So, any sort of help at all you could give in terms of things we should think about in terms of savings, 3Q and 4Q would be helpful? Thanks.","Dave Marberger","Well, let me just kind of picture that. We\u2019re not going to get in the practice of giving real granular quarterly guidance. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be too helpful. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be useful to you. What I can say is as if we are going to bend the trend and that\u2019s how you want to think about it, so it\u2019s not exactly linear there is going to be movement on all of these things quarter-to-quarter because there is all sorts of noise down in the granules that we don\u2019t need to get into. But it\u2019s going to be -- it\u2019s going to be a obviously you\u2019re going to see a change in SG&A in the back half and you\u2019ll see a improvement on the top line.","Operator","Thank you so much. And our next question will come from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney","Just one question on page 21 of your presentation today, you gave us a EPS allocation which is very helpful by the way that EPS bridge. Given that EPS allocation for the net EPS impact of volume loss, and I am wondering you multiply that out, it looks like you have $0.09 you gave us at 15 million bucks it's 31 odd percent which is roughly about your gross margin. I am trying to understand though within that, I would think maybe if it were some of the lower margin products you were eliminating maybe some and certainly the 21% decline in incremental sales that contribution margin might be a little bit lower. So how much kind of thought and allocation went into that number or is it just kind of putting an average gross margin on it firstly? And secondly, is that a good indicator maybe going forward of the kind of cost of volume your operating deleverage included as you go forward that might be offset by pricing and other stuff in the year ahead. Thanks very much.","Dave Marberger","It\u2019s a great question. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on what I call bridge accounting and most companies know I've done everywhere I\u2019ve been. The way these things come together, you tend to start to look at what\u2019s the price mix piece of this because you can quantify that, you obviously look at supply chain pieces and then the volume piece is sometimes tricky, right because we have a portfolio of 55 brands that are all at different rates of change and so it really becomes a blend.","So that\u2019s really how this comes together in terms of what the overall margin impact from the blended overall volume decline. I am not going to make any commentary on the specific volume piece of EPS going forward but I would say is the guidance we\u2019ve given on gross margin improvement factors in our estimates of what the volume impact would be. So that\u2019s the best I can do for you, and that\u2019s a good question.","Operator","Thank you so much. Next, we will hear from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for letting me ask the questions. Kind of the similar vein to Mr. Feeney\u2019s question in terms of offsets for volume, as we look at the price mix front, it\u2019s great to see in positive territory for sure. But I suppose, I am just a little bit surprised that it\u2019s not a bit more robust and actually fated to quarter-over-quarter given that presumably you are taking out some of your lower price mix products. So presumably, there should be a nice little mix benefit in there and then of course pulling out some of the inefficient trade support, I would think would be a bit of an incremental book. So can you give a little bit color on maybe what some of the offsets are and how we should think about that line both in terms of in the context your actions today as well as go forward? ","Thomas McGough","Jason, this is Tom McGough. You know we\u2019ve talked about our pricing in three components, inflation justified, trade productivity and pricing in conjunction with grain quality upgrades. So, if you think about some of the, obviously, we\u2019ve had positive in terms of upgrade trade productivity. But there are some businesses and categories that are more pass-through, beef and oil, eggs, dairy would be some of those. So on Hebrew National for example, there is pricing reduction with some insert reduction in cost of goods that shows up as a negative to pricing, a positive to cost of goods, and obviously a better kind of margin. Egg Beaters is another situation given the industry dynamics last year with cost coming down. So, those are some of the offset that suppress the overall pricing, but we really focused on is the gross margin expansion and that\u2019s what you see in our results is continued progress on gross margin expansion and we are doing this in a very focused and discipline way across the portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question will come from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies.","Lubi Kutua","Hi, good morning. This is actually Lubi filling in for Akshay. I wanted to ask a question about your innovation plan. Are you able to share anymore color in terms of sort of what\u2019s on the docket sort of back half of this year and early fiscal \u201918. And then so a follow-up to that if you could comment on what are some of the structural changes if any to the innovation process that ConAgra. So is that things like time to market getting faster, are we expecting a greater contribution in terms of incremental sales of just how we should think about that? Thank you.","Sean Connolly","Yes, I think in terms of specific things that are forthcoming, we provided, down there throughout provided a pretty robust preview of some of the innovation in our pipeline, something on our investor day, some things that are pretty close to hitting the market, some things that are farther out, some things that are going test market. So, you got to sneak peak of that and it\u2019s pretty exciting what we are going be able to do with brands like Healthy Choice and Slim Jim and other brands that are really granting up some excellent innovation on it.","Quite frankly, it\u2019s time because if you -- there is a lot of grumbling around lack of growth in the industry. But as Darren pointed out at Investor Day, when you peel back the onion, you look at it there are clear pockets of growth. Unfortunately, there has been big companies have been getting after that\u2019s been a small companies because they tend to be faster market. They tend to be more externally focused.","So, that brings to me the second piece of your question which is what structurally changing, we are much more externally focused, I would say than we\u2019ve been effect external focus is one of our company values. And we are determined to activate our insight and turn them into action and get our innovation ideas to market quicker. So, historically, it\u2019s been a slow slug for us to get insights, convert them in action and get them into market that is making progress. We are not all the way to bright yet, but I am very excited about some of the things that are in our pipe and it\u2019s only going to get better from here.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Nystedt, I'll hand the conference back to you for final remarks.","Johan Nystedt","Thank you. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded and will be archived on the web as detailed in our news release. As always, we\u2019re available for discussions. Thank you for your interest in ConAgra.","Operator","And this will conclude today\u2019s ConAgra brands second quarter earnings conference call. Thank you again for attending and have a good day."]}}
