[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media participating, we request that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported increased revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2012 compared with the second quarter last year. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $4.46 billion, up 13% compared to $3.96 billion in the second quarter of last year. Quarterly net income increased to $297 million, a 24% increase versus the $240 million earned a year ago.","Increased truck deliveries in North and South America and a growing Financial Services business contributed to PACCAR's increased profits.","For the first half, revenues were a record $9.2 billion, and net income was $624 million. In addition, PACCAR's dividend increased 60% compared to a year ago. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","Our customers in North America are benefiting from increased freight tonnage, improved fleet utilization rates and lower fuel prices. In Europe, freight transportation on German highways continues at good levels, comparable to last year. European transporters have also benefited from lower fuel prices in recent months.","Due to the uncertain global economy, some of our customers are not expanding their fleets at this time and are focused primarily on truck replacement. PACCAR delivered 37,700 trucks during the second quarter, about 10% higher than the same period last year, but down 5% from the first quarter of 2012. Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF grew their market share as customers recognized the benefits of our high-quality and efficient trucks. PACCAR's retail share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market was 29.9% for the first half.","DAF's share of truck registrations in Europe above 16-tonne reached 16%. Kenworth and DAF truck deliveries in the Andean region of South America, that is the region outside of Mercosur, increased by about 75% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year.","Looking forward, PACCAR expects to deliver about 10% fewer trucks in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due to the weak economic growth in the United States, coupled with the ongoing uncertainty in the Eurozone.","Looking at the broader market, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to improve this year to a range of 210,000 to 230,000 units, up 12% at the midpoint from 197,000 units last year. In Europe, the greater-than-16-tonne truck market is also anticipated to be in the range of 210,000 to 230,000 units, down slightly from the 241,000 units last year.","PACCAR's business initiatives worldwide are progressing well. Capital spending is estimated to be $450 million to $550 million, with research and development at $275 million to $300 million. Construction of our new DAF assembly factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, is progressing, and we plan to be building DAF Trucks in Brazil next year.","We're also very pleased with the excellent customer response to the launch of the new Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt Model 579, both very exciting trucks. During the second quarter, Kenworth and Peterbilt began limited production of these exciting new models, and they will gradually increase their production in the third and fourth quarters.","PACCAR is enhancing its network of 15 parts distribution centers. We're building a new 280,000 square foot distribution center in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, and our distribution centers in Madrid, Spain, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, are increasing their capacity to meet the demands of our customers and dealers.","PACCAR Financial Services revenue were $266 million in the second quarter compared to $258 million last year. PACCAR Financials second quarter pre-tax income jumped to a quarterly record $77 million compared to $57 million earned in the second quarter last year. The excellent results benefited from growth in portfolio balances and a lower provision for credit losses. PACCAR Financial, with its strong A+ credit rating, has excellent access to the commercial paper and medium-term note markets. In the second quarter, PACCAR Financial sold over $900 million in 2- and 3-year notes in the U.S. and Europe. PACCAR also completed the renewal of its $2 billion credit line.","Overall, PACCAR is well-positioned to further enhance its competitive position in the global truck market due to the strength of our dealers worldwide, a robust finance company and the highest-quality products in the industry.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of J. B. Groh of D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just wasn't writing fast enough, I guess. On your comments about 10% sequential decline, is that your North American, U.S., Canada? Or is that global or Europe or what?","Mark C. Pigott","It's primarily in the U.S. and Canada.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So Europe\u2026","Mark C. Pigott","Europe is fairly steady.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","But I noticed you didn't really change the outlook on North America, and given that the orders have been a little underwhelming, so to speak, can you sort of talk about that against that backdrop?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we adjusted the high end of the range.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Right. Okay. You brought that down a little bit, okay.","Mark C. Pigott","Right. And you're right. We probably have been in times where there had been stronger order intake for the industry, and I think that's why we're looking at the moderate production decrease.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then the incremental margins looked pretty strong in the quarter. Can you explain that? Is it new models? Are you just managing things better, supply chain? Where is it coming from?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I certainly think the team is doing a very good job of managing, as they do in every different type of economic market. I think, overall, we're getting good cooperation with our suppliers. The material side is in good shape. We've introduced some new models, but the models that we have had are in a good place in terms of production efficiency. The customers are interested in purchasing our vehicles. And so that has some positive impact on the margins. So overall, I think, just kind of managing the business, as you've indicated, in a good, professional manner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you kind of help us understand current -- we all have our own opinions -- but when you talk about the current fleet fundamentals been pretty good, trucks are old, yet the truck buyers are kind of slightly ordering below typical replacement demand. What do you think is going on? Is it just hesitation because of look-forward or government policy or something else?","Mark C. Pigott","That is a very topical question that has a lot of discussion in many companies around the industry, Andy. A couple of things: One, just to reiterate, I think for a number of years, most of the industry would expect that the replacement size is approximately 225,000 units a year, give or take, but in that range. So as you've noted, orders had been below that for a number of years. The other thing is we do have an older fleet, but when you look into that fleet, what you're going to find is a number of very good customers don't have too many miles on their vehicles. So they may be, let's call it, chronologically old, but when you look at it, they're not doing 125,000, 150,000 miles a year. So they're still in good shape. And so that's having an impact. Our customers, and many of them are publicly traded, so you can see their results, they're making good profits. They have survived a challenging 10 years with a couple of different recessions in there. So they're managing their business very well. The trucks are performing well, and I think, as we talk with our customers and we're out all the time, they're saying \"We'll just run these a little bit longer. They're in good shape.\" Obviously, there's some benefit for parts and service, but the trucks are just made well and performing well. So I think it's -- you see a term in most of the periodicals industry, sort of in a pause or sort of in a reflective mode. There's lots of different terms out there. I think people are saying, \"I'm running a fleet. I've got 100, 200, 500, 1,000 trucks. They're good. I'm getting great service from whatever dealer is providing that. I've got good freight rates. Fuel's manageable. There is a lot of freight. Let's just run them and kind of see what happens over the next 6 months.\"","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And to support the anticipated level of production in Q3 from Q2, which you said is primarily North America, does anything have to happen in the orders? Or is that sized to your current order flow?","Mark C. Pigott","I think that reflects the order flow versus production levels, yes.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then...","Mark C. Pigott","Good question. It's an interesting discussion, and we're all discussing it.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If I can fit one other in. You've, I'm sure, noticed that one of your competitors had a pretty sizable engine strategy shift. And I was wondering if you would expect any near-term share gains or any other impact on just general market conditions because of that.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, PACCAR, our focus is, a couple of things: One is providing return for our shareholders. Two, we do that by designing, selling and servicing the best products in the industry, and that's been guiding our company for 107 years. So competitors are always evaluating different strategies. I can't really comment on that. I know what we do, and hopefully, we share that with you and your colleagues and we keep a pretty steady course.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Barclays Capital.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, given the age of the fleet and that the customers are running the fleet for longer, do you think that the aftermarket opportunities that you have, both in the U.S. and in Europe, will just be better over the next 6 months, year, 18 months, better than even the historic run rate that you've had?","Mark C. Pigott","So, what you're asking, do we think that there will be a time when customers say, \u201cIt probably is a good time to replace my fleet\u201d? Is that what you're essentially asking?","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, what I'm saying is that the parts business could actually have higher growth now because you're -- these customers are running the trucks for longer than they have before.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, that has a, I think, probably a slight impact, but I would give the aftermarket group some praise in that they're developing a lot of new programs. There is a lot of e-commerce activity ongoing. We're reaching out to many more customers who might not necessarily actually operate our vehicles. They're also looking at different industries, not necessarily truck-related. So they have a pretty comprehensive, thorough plan to grow aftermarket services, and I'm also including Financial Services, sort of in line but a little bit independent of just the Truck business.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. And Mark, how does -- I know you\u2019ve talked about this before, but it does seem like one bright spot in the U.S. is housing starts, and they are continuing to improve. How do we factor in the upside from housing and its impact on trucks going forward? Do we need just a better U.S. economy? Or can we have real upside from housing?","Mark C. Pigott","Housing, as you've indicated, there is some little sunnier climate out there, talking about housing starts, maybe perhaps over 700,000 units this year, and that's a welcome relief for many industries. And I think when you look at the range of industries, whether it's the construction side with wood, concrete, timber, then the furnishings, that all is brought to the site by trucks. So the average, certainly over the last 10, 15, 20 years, for housing starts is about 1.2 million. I think when it gets closer to that level, then you'll see some impact, and I'm not talking about a lot but, certainly, a couple of percent impact to the vocational markets, whether it's the dump truck or the flatbed or the steel hauler, all great customers of ours and certainly companies that have had a slow patch for a number of years. So right now, it's just starting to improve -- let's see how it progresses over the next couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So margins were better than what we were expecting for the quarter. So nice job there. I'm wondering if you have another 10% sequentially down quarter here in the third quarter, can you give us your view on the sustainability of the margins?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the margins obviously reflect our market demand and production capacity and utilization. So I think as you look at the lower production levels, there will be some impact on the second -- on the third quarter margin attainment. But we'll continue to focus and run our business to optimize our returns.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. If I could ask a housekeeping question, could you give us the aftermarket, the parts revenue and the margin numbers?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we can. It's coming up.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I guess maybe in the meantime, Mark, can you talk about...","Mark C. Pigott","I got it here. For the second quarter, aftermarket parts revenues were $666 million, and the aftermarket parts margin was 34.3%.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, can you comment -- have you seen any change in used truck inventories or used truck pricing?","Mark C. Pigott","Used truck pricing continues to be very good, particularly for our vehicles. We're actually seeing a little bit of an uptick on used truck values across-the-board. So that's good. We're feeling pretty good about that. In Europe, used trucks are kind of holding their own.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And no issue with inventories at dealers or anything like that?","Mark C. Pigott","No, dealer inventory is very healthy, very healthy. Yes, we're in good shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Your SG&A was down a little bit sequentially, not that much, but it was down a little, and we've been hearing through the quarter that you've cut back on things like advertising spending in Europe. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of cost reduction activity might be going on in Europe in anticipation of potentially slower growth? I mean, are you guys considering pulling out of IAA or anything like that? Or are you comfortable that you've got the right sized organization there already?","Mark C. Pigott","I need to get your contacts.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I can tell you exactly which magazines you can pull that out of.","Mark C. Pigott","No, Ann, you've been around. Don't read -- don't believe everything you read. You know that. No, we're in good shape. In fact, I'm going to be in Hanover. So I hope to see you and your colleagues there. Always an excellent show, and it's -- no, we're -- we manage our business to reflect whatever the industry is. We've done it for decades, as you know. So we showed at the -- earlier this year, the Euro 6 engine that DAF is developing. So, we're out there -- regional shows, at vocational shows, just very normal. Very normal. And you enjoyed the Mid-America show a few months ago here in Louisville?","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, but you did pull out of that a few years ago, which was a big...","Mark C. Pigott","Well, that -- 2008 -- let's move forward here.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Exactly. And then curious also, second question, CNG LNG related, just -- we understand that at least on the LNG trucks that those are being leased. Can you talk a little bit about why the Financial Services business would want to take on the risk of leasing LNG trucks when there's no history for residual values or just curious a little bit on what's going on?","Mark C. Pigott","Ann, I have no idea what you're talking about. We sell our trucks. The natural gas market certainly gets a lot of press from different corners of the business arena. We're very proud that PACCAR is one of the leaders, if not the leader, in the natural gas market. It's a market that's only 1% to 2% of the total truck market. So I think we need to put it in context. The CNG is used actively, particularly in the ports in California, but we offer both, and we're going to be increasing our product offering with a 12-liter next year. So we're very pleased with where we are. If the market increases, and certainly, there's plenty of rhetoric in the newspapers and by political speakers, we're ready for it. We embrace it, and we're proud to supply those products to the industry.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I'll take my LNG-specific question off-line and follow up with Robin afterwards.","Mark C. Pigott","You might want to ask me now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if you could talk about over what time horizon you expect the business in Brazil to get to company average returns or now that you're building out the dealer network. Just give us an update, if you would, on how you view the path to the build-out and, ultimately, whether we can expect the same level of lean inventories, et cetera, that we're used to seeing in your other businesses.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, first of all, great question. And I am really looking forward to being able to invite many of our wonderful analysts to the factory when we get it up and running. Because what you'll see, as you've seen at all the factories, whether it's Mississippi or DAF, or St. Therese, or Chillicothe, it'll be exactly the same format and mode of operation. It'll be sparkling clean. It will be high technology. It'll be lean. It'll be motivated workforce and very high-quality products. In terms of returns, it will take 3 to 5 years. Obviously, it has something to do with the market. As you've indicated, we are beginning the process of appointing dealers, and those dealers will be independent dealers. They'll be building their dealerships around the country. We have a very steady program under way of building the factories. So that's on track. We're getting great cooperation and partnership with many of our suppliers that we work with around the world who are already in Brazil. And I think from the customers -- of course, we don't sell any trucks in Brazil at this time. But potential customers are very positive and excited about DAF coming in. They know the reputation of the product from around the world. They've contacted many customers in Europe,who they might have a relationship with. And they're really looking forward to the great product, great support and high-quality residuals and low operating cost. So it's going to be good. But it takes time to increase the business.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mark, you mentioned a medium-term share target of about 10% for that market. I'm wondering if you could care to comment on what kind of market share level would the operation be profitable for you. Can you lay that out for us?","Mark C. Pigott","We tend not to break that out. But as you know in PACCAR, we like every group to be profitable.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you saw very good deliveries out of your legacy South American business this quarter as you pointed out. Can you just talk about the order trends and visibility? How far out is your visibility in that part of the business? And is that what's offsetting what we might expect to be bigger production cuts in the U.S.?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, Mexico, in particular, continues to be strong. We have approximately 50% market share. We've been there since the late '50s, so we have a strong legacy and strong position within the Mexican market. And many of the trucks we're selling in South America are manufactured in Mexico. Colombia has been a particularly strong country, particularly for oil transport. But Chile, Peru are other countries that are doing reasonably well. And it's not huge numbers, but they're steady, they're growing. We did open up a distribution, parts distribution center, in Santiago, over a year ago, I guess. And that's providing some very good aftermarket service. We're appointing some new dealers in the region. They're enthusiastic in making investments in their own businesses. So it's all coming together in a very orderly, straightforward manner. We're encouraged by it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And on the U.S. side, to get to the production reduction you're talking about for the third quarter, can you just give us a sense, is that for additional holiday shutdowns or the mechanism by which you're cutting production?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we don't usually break that out. But we do all of the above as appropriate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn of UBS.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Some of the recent checks we've done have indicated that credit may actually be easing for truckers in North America. Could you talk about credit availability in general and then, maybe more specifically, your appetite to grow PACCAR Financial?","Mark C. Pigott","Credit has been very good, very normal for -- certainly, for us and for our customers. We've seen some new entrants into the industry. Obviously, a number exited during the recession. Some have kind of come back in, dipped their toe in the marketplace. But for our customers who are usually very well financed and capitalized, we're seeing very normal, steady business. In terms of PACCAR Financial, of course, it's very much linked with our production side, and it's one of our aftermarket services that we are able to offer to our customers and our dealers. So I think the growth sort of is in line with our overall production.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's helpful. And with the choppy environment, is there any changes -- are there any changes to the way that truckers are spec-ing trucks, maybe if they're higher end or lower end then, more specifically, 13- versus 15-liter?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, that's a great question, and probably choppy is an appropriate term on certain aspects of the business. I think the 13-liter versus 15-liter is a multiple chapter book that we are beginning to delve into. You do see on some measurements that 13-liter is outselling the 15-liter. That tends to have a little bit of to and fro depending on what fuel prices actually are and what our customers perceive them to be in the future. But nevertheless, I think the 13-liter and the 15-liter both have strong positions to play, at least in the short term. As you know in the markets outside of the U.S. and Canada, 13-liter tends to be the largest engine size that you would see in Europe or South America, Asia. And I would think over time, that will probably be the way that the North American market will trend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss [ph] of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Unknown Analyst","Can you give us any insight into the age of the fleet in Europe? And I'm just trying to get any sense if we're getting to the point where we could see some pent-up demand and need for a replacement cycle as we move past 2013.","Mark C. Pigott","No, the fleet in Europe is probably 1 to 2 years younger than North America, sort of 5, 5 to 6 years. And some of the fleets don't travel quite as many miles as their counterparts would in North America. So I don't think there's that pressure for customers to necessarily say, I need to replace large segments of their fleets at this time. I think just normal replacement to take advantage of ongoing technology improvements. As you may know, DAF introduced recently their ATe, advanced technology, let's call it, fuel efficiency improvements. So that's causing a number of our good customers to say, \"Wow, that could really be a benefit for me if I turn in some of my trucks.\" But overall, I think we were just in Europe a few weeks ago. And we traveled from Ireland, the U.K., Holland, Belgium through Germany all the way to Hungary. And I'd say, for the most part, customers were reasonable in terms of their outlook. They were feeling that business was pretty good. It wasn't just booming, but it was pretty good. And the dealers, many of our dealers, were -- say, \"Inventory is in great shape.\" They're seeing some good aftermarket business. Used trucks are holding their value. So it's just -- if you read the paper or read the Internet, it causes you to think, \u201cWhat's going on?\u201d But when we really talk at the ground-level to the people hauling freight, there's business out there, people are buying. Not every industry or, certainly, not in every market, but it's reasonable.","Unknown Analyst","And then just trying to get at the margins a little bit. Can you talk about some end markets -- is energy still strong? Is that helping your mix? What's happening with your share in Class 6 and 7, just some of the factors that might also feed [ph] into the mix.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the oil and gas, I think it's still good. It might've slowed down a little bit, but it's going at a pretty strong rate. Medium-duty is doing okay, particularly in Europe, over 10% share. And in fact, I think a few months, it actually bumped 11%. So that's probably pretty close to a record or might be a record for us. And we keep working it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, can you talk about -- one of the suppliers in the market came out with a 2013 forecast, I think, calling for build rates of 260 to 280, relative to their forecast of 280 this year. So it's the first sort of truck supplier that I\u2019ve heard talking to a potentially down year. So can you talk about sort of your comments on that or what you would need to see to get that, I guess, to get that bearish. My second question, can you talk about your strategy to gain market share given the dislocation in the market with Navistar and whether you or anyone else is -- how sensitive, I guess, the customers are to price and given the market dynamics? And then third, what are your assumptions for build rates for Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2 in the U.S., specifically?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. Okay. Well, production in Q3, as we said, will be down about 10%.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","In Q4?","Mark C. Pigott","In Q4, we didn't put a number out there yet.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Do you want to?","Mark C. Pigott","Not at this time. So that's one item. Two, in terms of market dislocation, as you so kindly indicated, we're not driving to get to a particular share. Over the last 30, 40 years, by building great trucks, our share has steadily increased. But there's always competitors who have a share target, and they'll use typically price to achieve whatever that number is, we don't do that. So share will bounce around, and it always has, for all the competitors in all the markets. But our strategy is, quite simply, we're going to build the best products in the market and give our customers the lowest operating cost. And share will, in a sense, take care of itself. And so that's really all I can make on that point. In terms of any supplier forecast for 2013, probably a little bit premature to talk about that.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But I mean, you must have -- Mark, you've been in this business for quite some period of time, and no more than us. So I guess I was surprised by 2 things: One, I was struck that you didn't lower U.S. forecasts more; and I think the market is viewing a potential down year next year or a flat year. Just what you would need to see to get to that level of the market. I mean, where would orders have to trend, I mean, or handicap the probability that you think we could have a flat to down year? I mean, I'm assuming...","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think it's really going to depend, Jamie, on the general economy, and you can start with the elections in November, you can talk about tax policy, you can talk about general confidence of the consumers, we can talk about the overall housing industry, which, as we talked a little bit earlier in the call, has had some uptick. But you know what? I've seen it before. And then it can go another way. So there's a lot of macro elements that are going to influence what our excellent customers finally do. If several of those line up in, what I would call, a positive pro-business alignment, truck business will be pretty good. But, as you say, I have been doing this, and the whole PACCAR team has been doing this for a long, long time. Will it be as good as this year? Or will it be better? I would say that if we get a little bit more of a pro-business attitude and it impacts several key industries, it could be reasonable next year. If that doesn't happen, it could be comparable to this year, which -- this year, we're saying it's going to be slightly better than last year. It's not at replacement cycle. Certainly, eventually, you're going to have the impact of trucks that were built in '05, '06, '07 that will need to get replaced, and there are a lot of trucks built in that cycle. That was a very strong, call it, irrational exuberance in many industries. So those trucks will eventually have to come into the marketplace, and that'll be good for truck builders like us. So all in all, 2013, it's got a lot of variables that need to be finalized before we can see how it's going to shake out.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can I ask one more question, if possible? I was surprised in the quarter that your bad debt expense came down to 1.9% in the quarter. Just given everything that's going on in the macro, I would think this would go the other way. So can you just talk about that, please?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, absolutely. In kind of tying in with, I think, Joel's or Henry's question, our customers are in good shape, and our dealers are in good shape. And as they say, if you don't read the paper, you don't read Internet and you just get out and go to the towns and cities around North American and Europe, these people are saying, \u201cIs it booming? No. But is it reasonable? Yes.\u201d So the customers that we're financing have got good balance sheets. They're making money. They've got great customers that they're taking care of. They've sized their fleets according to the demand from their customers. So I think it's a good question you're asking, and people tend to sort of say well, \"Is the world like Greece?\" No, it's not. There are a lot of great companies out there that we're proud to partner with that are doing very, very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Given the pullback, I forgot exactly what words you used, Mark, but the consolidation that we're seeing in orders, can you just let us know if you're seeing anything with respect to price cutting in the market?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I would say in the 35 years I've been in this business, there's always price cutting somewhere in the market. So that's not really a big indicator. It depends what competitive strategies our competitors are employing at the time. I think as you see a market go down, and we have a cycle every 3 to 5 years in a down market, margins are impacted because customers are going to take advantage of the economics of time.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Is that happening now? Or is that not the market we're in?","Mark C. Pigott","I think there is a -- there's certainly some of that going on.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'm curious about your 680, 579 launch, which you mentioned at the outset here. Can you give us a sense of sort of what percent of orders that might be, if it's meaningful, and where you might think it would be, say, 12 months from now?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it's right on schedule in terms of our very gradual introduction. These are really very wonderful products, and they're a great complement to our existing products. We've installed a lot of new machinery in our factories, which are undergoing their final evaluations, and that's all on track and on schedule and looking good. So it's early days now. Over the next 12 months, we will see a gradual ramp-up. We're getting good orders. People are saying, \"I'd like to order these products when they're available.\" And one year from now, I\u2019d be hard-pressed to tell you what exactly that number is going to be, but it will be making a contribution.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Could it be 20% of volume in a year?","Mark C. Pigott","It's possible, yes. Sure.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess the reason I'm asking is because I'm thinking based on your conversation that you just had and some other things that we've talked about, that the margin on that product should be probably better than your corporate average.","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, I see. That's a good analysis, and it -- yes, there are some benefits to the product in terms of the margin. I think let's talk about it as the quarters go on. We'll give you a little bit more clarity.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right, appreciate that. And then the tax rate was a little higher than I expected in the quarter. Do we have a forecast for the year?","Michael T. Barkley","Yes, the forecast for the year will still be in the 32.5% to 33% range. The tax rate for the quarter reflects the mix of U.S. versus foreign income and the higher U.S. rates that we have.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just -- if you don't mind, can you give us just a broad sense of maybe production at the engine facility here in the U.S.? Maybe something in the line of sort of engines per day that we have now and where you think that might exit the year?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, the engine production has increased at a steady pace throughout the year. We're, say, as indicated, 25% to 30% of our production. So those going into Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, and that seems to be a good pace at this time, I think it will increase over time. But we continue to add machining capabilities and become more and more efficient as we increase the utilization of the factories. So I think it's making a great contribution, not only on the production side and the integration of our powertrain, but we're also seeing some benefits in the aftermarket side.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. But just so I'm clear, would we be expecting higher production levels by year-end than we have right now?","Mark C. Pigott","I think reflecting the slower production rates that are in the truck side, probably the engine side will be pretty level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer of Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","A couple of questions on Europe. Can you talk about the order rate in the quarter, maybe just directionally, was it up or down from the first quarter? And specifically, if you could comment on pricing in Europe and how that might compare to other markets? And I believe it was Volvo this morning said that France had weakened a little bit in the second quarter, and I believe that's a pretty important market for DAF, and I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing there.","Mark C. Pigott","The order rate has been pretty constant through most of the year for us in Europe. France, like every country, is an important market and a little factoid for you is that DAF is either #1 or #2 in every country, with the exception of Germany, where we're #3 in terms of share. Obviously, each country has a different sized market. But the good thing, DAF is in all the markets, and it's also grown and is the market leader in Central Europe and is growing its business in the Middle East, Africa and Russia. So that's a nice addendum to our business in Western Europe.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And one other just sort of question about the potential for a prebuy ahead of the Euro 6 standards, are you seeing any demand for build slots in the fourth quarter of '13?","Mark C. Pigott","Not at this time. A number of our competitors introduced 1 or 2 models that were Euro 6 ready. They did that earlier this year. But if you're talking to a customer to talk about what are you going to buy 2 years out, is usually a little bit of a stretch.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, sure. And then if I could just throw one more in back about the North America construction cycle and replacement there. I mean, we usually talk about 3 or 4 years as the early end of the truckload replacement cycle. Can you give us a sense of what that is for customers that are hauling -- using mixers and dump trucks and those kind of things, the real construction-intensive trucks?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, those trucks, because they do significantly less miles, they can be 7, 8 years, easily.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes. So we still could have a few more years before that replacement cycle kicks in?","Mark C. Pigott","Actually, I think that's a very insightful point you're making.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","One quick question. So industry build rates in the first half have been a little bit interesting in North America, and obviously, you guys have taken some very appropriate cuts, and I'm not sure the industry has followed. So if you're willing to answer a general question, does that have necessarily a pricing impact? Or do those trucks somehow they already had orders attached, so it's not a pricing risk? And if that's too general, maybe if you could tell us what percentage...","Mark C. Pigott","Happy to jump in on that one. Excellent question, Rob. I think what you'll probably find, and in fact, I think it's been in a few of our competitors' quarterly filings, is that you'll probably be seeing some production adjustments from the industry as a whole. And sometimes, that's not spelled out completely clearly, but it may be shutdown days. It may be just reducing build rate while maintaining the same number of employees. It may be actually reducing build rate. So I think everybody is facing the same demand.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Now that's helpful. And I guess I was wondering if those trucks that were already sort of built and sitting around were a price risk for the industry and\/or if you could say what portion of your mix in North America is sort of spec-ed out specific for a fleet and if over-built trucks really are a risk or most of them are spec-ed out?","Mark C. Pigott","Actually, I think the industry inventory is in very good shape. So I think we need to sort of put a stopper in the bottle on that one. The inventory is in good shape, particularly at our dealers. And our philosophy has always been to build to a customer specification. So if we've got an order, we're happy to build your truck, but we really don't build a spec truck. Some of the competitors may do that. I'm not sure how they're doing.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, that's great. And then if I could ask one small follow-up, are you able to say when you would need to see orders in North America again pick up to hit the higher end of your estimated range for the year?","Mark C. Pigott","Any time would be good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman of Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I guess the first question, maybe just a follow-up on the inventory question. PACCAR's own inventories stepped up from the first quarter, although the sales were down from the first quarter level. And I was wondering if you could help us understand better why that is.","Mark C. Pigott","I think inventory levels are pretty consistent. Are you talking about PACCAR?","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, so I think that's just a reflection of timing of production schedules and build rates. So, it's all -- the inventory is in good shape and balanced with our production needs.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then could you talk about -- I guess, you commented about the Europe orders, recently had been somewhat steady through the year. What do your North America orders look like relative to what we saw in the first quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, as I indicated, we'll be looking at a 10% fewer trucks primarily in the U.S. and Canadian market in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And Europe is pretty steady.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Got it. And then on -- can you talk about what price realization was for this quarter? I think, last quarter, you had roughly a $157 million of price and maybe 4% to sales, and I'm wondering how that played out this quarter, if you have that figure handy.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Just a moment.","Michael T. Barkley","If you're talking about the contribution to margin from truck sales prices, that's $66 million in the second quarter.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then was there any impact from currency to -- or could you talk about the magnitude of the impact to sales and income?","Michael T. Barkley","Yes, the overall impact on currencies was a reduction compared to the prior year of $139 million in revenue and $4 million in pretax profit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan of Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Mark, thanks for your commentary on the North American pricing. That was very helpful. Can you just comment what you're seeing as far as industry trends and any competitive movements on the European side of the business as far as pricing?","Mark C. Pigott","In Europe primarily, Patrick?","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I mean I think you spoke at length to North America.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. I think in Europe -- are you based in Europe?","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, I'm based in New York.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Well, as you travel around in Europe, it's obviously, many different scenarios being played out in different countries. So you have to be mindful of that. I think several of our competitors who are perhaps more focused on Southern Europe are feeling the negative impact much more than certainly others are. And that probably will have an impact on their pricing. In terms of what we're seeing is pretty steady. Obviously, the market is slightly lower than last year, but reasonable. And we\u2019ve gained some share as people like the products that we're building, and where the economies are a little bit stronger, we tend to be the leader in those markets. So that for DAF is a positive scenario. I think everybody in our industry would like to see an increased market size, and that's probably not in the cards in the near future, but eventually, it will be.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And can I just sneak one more in? Just to clarify the Q3 production outlook. So overall, PACCAR production down 10% with Europe flattish. That implies U.S. and Canada is going to be down in the range of 15% to 20%, sequentially?","Mark C. Pigott","I think that's probably in the ballpark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Basili Alukos of Morningstar.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess, one question. Going back to the engine penetration, I was wondering if you could bifurcate that 20% to 25%, or 25% to 30% of the internal production between your current run rate of -- or at least normalized business on the U.S. side, call that, your 25% traditional market share versus the about 4% or 5% of the market share that you\u2019ve picked up over the last year.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we kind of look at it that we've really picked up 25% to 30% over the last year or 2, since that's when we started our factory up.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes, sorry, maybe, like the 25% of your current business on the truck side, what percentage of the MX engines are on those versus the, call it, the 5 percentage points of market share you've gained on the North American Class 8 truck share? Just trying to get a sense of on those new customers\u2026","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, I see. I think it's probably in line. Probably about 25%, which has added up to, let's say, 30%. Yes, if that's answering your question.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. Yes, I was just try to get a sense of, obviously, with what's happening with your...","Mark C. Pigott","I think broadly, the engine is doing well. We're having a lot of good response from our customers across different industries and different locales who are seeing improved fuel economy. It's very quiet. It's an easy engine to operate. And once again, it's been in the marketplace for, let's call it, 1.5 years, and we're starting to get some good endorsements, which is causing other great customers to say, \"It's been out for 1.5 years. Let me try some of those.\" So it's positive.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So do you think maybe you're winning new business due to the engine or just due to the quality of the truck?","Mark C. Pigott","Both.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just following up on your 10-Q have called out the formal investigation with SEC. I'm just wondering if you could provide us with any follow-up.","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think it's all on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I'd like to follow-up on the ForEx question a little bit. Could you possibly -- would you be willing to give us an idea for how much of that ForEx impact was more of a European-base versus, say, rest of the world? Because the real is down almost 20% against the dollar. The peso is down. I just kind of want get a sense for how that's affecting things. And then, kind of secondly, when you're looking at these capital investments you're making in Brazil and around the world, I would guess it just got a little cheaper for you. So could you discuss kind of the benefits you might be seeing in terms of capital allocation?","Michael T. Barkley","Okay. So the ForEx impacts that we're talking about are primarily the movements of the euro versus the U.S. dollar, which is down about 7% compared to the prior year on average. And certainly, as the real declines, it does reduce the dollar impact of the capital that we were investing there at the moment. And so that's why we have a range because we don't know exactly what's going to happen to currencies going forward.","Mark C. Pigott","And I think picking up on that good comment that...","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","All right. And one last follow-up. Cost of goods sold. Raw material costs are starting to come down. Is -- can you talk about where you're seeing the impact of, let's say, raw material costs coming down? And are you able to keep a fair amount of that internally?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, you're correct. Raw material is coming down, I think with the exception of probably copper and natural rubber. And this is obviously reflective of what's going on in the global business markets. We have -- over 75% of our components are covered by long-term agreements. And those long-term agreements, I think, are really an excellent tool for both us and our suppliers. So there are some mechanisms that will reflect lower commodity prices. But they're not just instantaneous. So, it will go down, but can you tell me in 3 months, are they going to go back up? Well, there might be some slight improvement, but overall, the good news is our suppliers are in good shape. They are making investments. They see that some of the markets are a little slower. But they're getting ready for when they do improve, and they're able to improve their quality and their capacity, and that's healthy for the whole industry. So overall, it's pretty steady.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Leiker of Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Two questions for you. On the 13-liter that you're building here in the U.S. right now, how much of that supply chain and material production do you have now domiciled here in the U.S. versus bringing it over from Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I would say that it's -- I don't have the exact percent, but it's increasing in terms of the local content. And it will continue to increase. Obviously, we started out 1.5 year ago, importing key components from our DAF factory, but as we ramped up in production and brought on suppliers, we're shifting that on a pretty steady basis over to North American suppliers.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then as the euro goes lower, at what point does it make sense to continue to bring that from Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we plan to eventually have the majority of the components in North America because we're not really doing this for an exchange rate hedge. We like to source in local currency. Yes, you can get an advantage, but you can also get a disadvantage. And our focus is on the highest-quality products at the lowest overall manufacturing cost because the exchange rate is good, but then you also have the longer time and the freight cost. So we're going to move it higher and higher to be in North America.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","We might have -- this might have come up earlier, and I had to jump off for a little bit, but 6 months ago or so, there was a lot of discussion around the industry of the cumulative increased cost of emissions and the inability to recoup that in the marketplace. Where do you think you\u2019re at or the industry is at right now in terms of being able to recoup those emission costs?","Mark C. Pigott","I'd say over the last 6 months, there's been some positive movement but, certainly, have not recouped the costs. And looking out to the future, it's going to take a very strong market to make a sizable dent on those costs.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Do you think that the transition that Navistar is going helps alleviate some of that, and everyone\u2019s able to recoup some more of those costs?","Mark C. Pigott","I'm not sure what they're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso of ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","One quick question. The targeted U.S. Canada build schedule. I want to try to think about the build schedule beyond 3Q. Did you target a build schedule that's consistent with the recent order pattern that we've seen, or if the orders stay the same as we've seen, is that up or down for the fourth quarter versus third quarter? I\u2019m just trying to get a feel for how much you cut the third quarter relative to the recent order patterns.","Mark C. Pigott","I think that question was pretty well answered earlier on, that 15% or so cuts in U.S. and Canada.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, that's not my question. My question is that cut, are we then at a level that's consistent with the recent orders, thus say, if orders pick up, your build schedule goes up in the fourth quarter or if the orders stay the same? I'm just trying to get a feel, looking at the orders\u2026","Mark C. Pigott","I think -- no. I mean, the way we operate, we try to have our production rate reflect incoming orders at a reasonable backlog, and that's what we're doing. And so if the orders come in at the rate they've been coming in for the last couple of months, then the production rate will be held pretty steady. If they increase, we will very gladly increase production.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the third quarter reflects the recent order activity. So any movement from that level should flow right into your build\u2026","Mark C. Pigott","That's accurate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Rogers of Gagnon Securities.","Mark Rogers","I want to make sure I understood what your, I guess, strategy is for internally sourcing engines. And if you could frame that with respect to the LNG and CNG opportunity, I'd appreciate it.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, those are a little bit -- 2 different elements. But our strategy is to continue to grow our PACCAR branded engine in Kenworth and Peterbilt. If you go to Europe, I'm sure you have, you'll see that all engines in our DAF lineup: LF, CF, XF; are PACCAR branded. That is our strategy here. So we're making good strategy on that. In terms of LNG, CNG...","Mark Rogers","Okay. And then, is the plan going forward to continue sourcing your LNG engines from your partners, such as Cummins, or do you eventually plan on being able to do this in-house?","Mark C. Pigott","No, we work with Westport and Cummins, both excellent companies. And at this time, it's a very good partnership and seems to work well and provide our customers with a very high-quality, efficient solution in the natural gas markets.","Mark Rogers","Great. And then if I could, you are introducing that 12-liter Cummins-Westport branded engine. And I was wondering if you could just give a high level commentary on the anticipated demand for this engine platform.","Mark C. Pigott","Well we have the 9 and the 15, so I think the 12 will provide a nice middle point for customers. But I think as I indicated earlier, it's a market that's only 1% to 2% of the total truck market. So we'll see what happens.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Robin E. Easton","I'd like to thank everyone for their excellent questions, and thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's Earnings Call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has any objections, they should disconnect at this time. ","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode.","Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported strong revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2017. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.7 billion and second quarter net income was $373 million, a 7.9% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $823 million and record pretax profits of $152 million. PACCAR achieved excellent combined truck and parts gross margins of 14.6%, driven by higher North American truck deliveries, the strong European truck market and the record PACCAR Parts results. I'm very proud of our 24,500 employees around the world who have delivered outstanding products and services to our customers.","PACCAR delivered 39,400 trucks during the second quarter, 13% higher than the first quarter and 6% above last year's second quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth raised build rates during the quarter in response to robust order intake this year. Looking ahead, PACCAR expects 2% to 3% higher deliveries in the third quarter compared to the second due to the higher build rates in all markets, partially offset by fewer build days in Europe due to the normal summer shutdown. Third quarter gross margins are projected to be comparable to second quarter margins. ","We've raised our forecast for Europe's above 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 310,000 units, reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook. Europe's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.8% in the U.K. and on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways year-to-date was at record levels and up 3.6% compared to the same period last year. ","During the second quarter, DAF introduced new model year 2017 XF and CF trucks which deliver up to 7% higher fuel economy compared to the previous models. This contributed to DAF's 10% growth in above 16-tonne orders in the first half this year compared to the same period last year.","U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales are expected to be in the range of 200,000 to 220,000 units this year. Class 8 truck industry orders were up 44% in the first half this year compared to the same period in 2016. Peterbilt and Kenworth's Class 8 retail sales market share was an excellent 31% in the second quarter and 29.6% year-to-date through June. Customers appreciate the ongoing investments by Kenworth and Peterbilt in enhanced truck models, expanded PACCAR powertrain options and onboard technology. The U.S. economy's steady expansion is projected to be 2.2% GDP growth and 1.8% industrial production growth this year, supporting healthy freight levels.","PACCAR Parts' quarterly pretax income of $152 million was 14% higher than a year ago. PACCAR Parts' quarterly revenues of $823 million were 9% higher than in the same quarter of last year. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, our outstanding logistics capabilities which provide high parts availability to dealers and customers and the growing number of TRP All Makes retail stores globally.","PACCAR Financial Services' second quarter pretax income increased 10% to $63 million compared to $57 million last quarter. The portfolio continued to perform well. U.S. Class 8 industry truck -- used trucks volumes increased during the quarter. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values continue to command a 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $3 billion in new products and facilities in the last 5 years. This year, capital expenditures of $375 million to $425 million and research and development expenses of $250 million to $270 million are targeted for truck and powertrain product development, enhanced manufacturing and parts distribution facilities and aftermarket support programs.","We're pleased to announce then new PACCAR Silicon Valley Innovation Center which will open this year in Sunnyvale, California. The facility will coordinate next-generation product development and will identify emerging technologies for the benefit of future vehicle performance. The Innovation Center will develop exciting new technology applications for advanced driver assistance systems, artificial intelligence, vehicle connectivity and augmented reality, complementing the research and development currently happening in PACCAR's truck divisions and technical centers. PACCAR looks forward to expanding its partnerships with the many innovative technology companies in Silicon Valley. ","We're very proud of our team at the PACCAR engine factory in Columbus, Mississippi. Since opening in 2010, the plant has demonstrated its world-class diesel engine manufacturing capabilities and was recently named Quality Magazine's plant of the year. We're nearing completion of a $35 million investment in additional capacity at Columbus to support growing customer demand for the PACCAR MX-13 and PACCAR MX-11 engines.","PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by delivering the highest quality products and services in the industry.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Can I just clarify the comments you made about higher deliveries quarter-over quarter in Q3 because that would not typically be the seasonal expectation we'd have. Was that a North America comment? Or was that total deliveries?","Ronald Armstrong","Total deliveries are up 2% to 3%, so the higher average build rates in North America as well as in Australia, Mexico and Brazil are then offset by the seasonal summer shutdown in Europe.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That's helpful and good to know. And then would you expect -- there's nothing to suggest given the level of backlog you have and given the orders that you have, there's nothing to suggest that daily builds would slow in Q4, is there?","Ronald Armstrong","At this point, assuming the economy continues to tick along and we feel good about our build rates and maintaining those through the rest of this year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then just as a follow-up. On the Finco business, can you talk about used values? I know you mentioned that yes, you command a premium but the premium could be up 0. So can you talk about used values? And what you're seeing out there? And whether we've really stabilized? Or is there any downside risk still to used values?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think in the second quarter, the values in Europe were very stable and in the U.S., down just slightly but very comparable to first quarter levels. And the amount of the used truck results in the second quarter were about $4 million better than the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","I appreciate your color on the gross margins for the third quarter, I think you said comparable to the second quarter. Should we assume your margin forecast for the year is now up versus where you guys guided to last quarter, just because of the run rate that we're at? So I guess that would be my first question. And then, I guess, my second question, can you just talk about sort of the order board in the U.S. and Europe, how widespread it is? In the U.S., is it -- are the big guys stepping in? Is it the small fleets? Just any color on where strength is coming from.","Ronald Armstrong","So I think we talked earlier about a range of 14% to 14.5%. I think we'll be closer to the upper end of that range for the full year. And when it comes to demand, I think it's pretty broad-based whether you look at vocational, you look at on-highway, you look at fleet, both small, mid and large. I think it's a good cross-section. We've seen all the segments go up as we progress through the course of the year.","Jamie Cook","And any color on the order board geographically? Whether it's in Europe or the U.S.?","Ronald Armstrong","Both are very solid, so we're in good shape as we look, sit here today. The backlogs are strong.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about truck margin. I mean I know clearly that you saw some sequential recovery in truck margin but you're still down on positive sales growth in truck only. Can you help us a little bit with the year-on-year bridge? And specifically what's happened with pricing?","Ronald Armstrong","The primary thing impacting is currency movements, primarily the impact of the pound versus the euro and the peso versus the dollar. If you adjust for those, then they're very comparable.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Okay. And then can you say did you experience any disruption in the European truck business due to bottlenecks in the supply chain or anything? One of your competitors was pretty vocal about that last week.","Ronald Armstrong","No. We have not seen any impacts as a result of supplier disruptions at all. Suppliers are doing great.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Tiss","Really terrible quarter. We're getting bored from all these beats. I just wondered, I guess you guys got to stick with your strengths, right?","Ronald Armstrong","We do what we do and we try to do it well.","Joel Tiss","I just wondered if you could give us a sense, is Brazil -- has it turned the corner? Is it profitable at this point? And any sense maybe by 2020, like to fuzz it up enough to give us some color, where do you think your market share could be?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, the team has done a great job of building the business. And as we have progressed through the course of this year, we're going to take an additional build rate increase during the third quarter to support the increasing demand. The product is doing just extremely well in the market. Our dealers are continuing to invest and build their businesses in spite of a very difficult economy and difficult truck market. We feel like the investments that we made will provide an excellent long term return for shareholders. So we've been able to grow our share from 0% up to 5-plus percent in the above 40 tonne segment of that market. So I think that pace of growth will continue to be an opportunity for our DAF business there as we progress through the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. So hopefully we could double that position in that timeframe.","Joel Tiss","Great. And then on the engine business, is the North American aftermarket started to kick in? Or is it still a little bit too early for that?","Ronald Armstrong","No. I think it's -- the more engines, I think, we're up to about 140,000 PACCAR MX engines in the park as we sit here today. And so we'll continue to increment that as we progress, so it's progressing all the time. It's probably the single biggest growth there for the Parts division in terms of the various segments of their Parts business.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about your longer term R&D outlook. So in the press release, you spoke about all of the growth initiatives you folks are pursuing on the technology side. And as you think about your R&D budget, should we be thinking about that moving higher as a percentage of sales off of 2017 levels? Or is that just a change in prioritization versus other investments? How should we think about that?","Ronald Armstrong","We usually don't think about it as a percent of revenue, we think about it in terms of absolute dollars and how much we're investing to support what we see as our strategic direction for the next 4, 5 years. And I think what you'll see is maybe a steady, slight increase year-on-year as we continue to invest in the many things that we talked about with driver -- advanced driver assistance systems, vehicle connectivity, continuing to build on the efficiency of our powertrain, adding powertrain options for our customers. So I think it will be pretty steady with a slight increase over time.","Jerry Revich","And in terms of the front axle production that you've -- your folks are highlighting as ramping up in Texas, can you just give us a timeframe of when you expect that facility to be at full production rate? And based on the specifications that you plan to produce there, what proportion of your fleet will be covered? What proportion of your models will be covered by your own front axles once production ramps up?","Ronald Armstrong","So this is a 20,000-pound front axle and it's primarily for heavier vehicle applications. And so we'll start production, initial production in the third quarter and we'll see that ramp up over a 12-month period. And at full production, it could be up to 20% of the axles that we put in our Class 8 vehicles.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","I just wanted to ask about -- a couple of questions. On the Finco margin, it improved from the first quarter 1Q to 2Q, but how long do you think it will take to kind of get back to that mid- to high 20% operating margin level? I mean you talked about sort of stabilizing used truck pricing. Do you expect the decks to be kind of cleared here by the end of the year? Or do you think that this sort of bleeds out further is the first question.","Ronald Armstrong","Well, I think we've -- we're probably selling a few more trucks than we're taking in, in the first half of this year. We'll probably see that continue a little bit in the second half. And then things, in terms of volumes, will get sort of balanced as we start next year in terms of what we're selling versus what's coming in.","Seth Weber","Okay. So you think it's fair to expect that margins next year could be more kind of normal relative to what we've seen over the last half a dozen years or so?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, it really just depends. The key thing is the used truck valuations in the market and so we'll see how that moves. But part of the positive thing for PACCAR Financial, particularly in the U.S., that beginning next year, pretty much all the returns that will be coming off lease will be the 2.1-meter model truck compared to the legacy 1.9 meter. So that gives us some upside on the used truck valuations going forward as well.","Seth Weber","That's good color. And then just maybe a follow-up on Europe. Is there any granularity you could help with Eastern Europe versus Western Europe? I think last quarter you talked about some strength in some of the -- in Russia or some of the Eastern European markets. Is there any update there that you could share?","Ronald Armstrong","I'd say the strength in Russia continues. We're seeing good orders continuing to deliver.","Harrie Schippers","And the rest of Eastern Europe is developing very similar to Western Europe for the first half of this year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","I guess starting with price cost. So I suspect that higher material costs were probably a headwind within the truck segment with respect to margins this quarter. Does that continue into the second half? Or do material cost headwinds ease from here?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. It wasn't much of a factor in the results for the quarter. There are some upward pressures but we have long term agreements and those impacts tend to get spread over time and managed through. And so that wasn't a significant impact. The key impact of margins for the quarter primarily was the currency impacts I referenced earlier.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. That's helpful, Ron. And then secondly, if it's possible to give us a little bit more color on the 3Q delivery guidance. So the up 2% to 3% Q-on-Q, what's the order of magnitude for the growth in North America versus the decline in Europe that you guys are embedding?","Ronald Armstrong","Let me see if I can. So Europe would be down about 10% because of the summer shutdown period. And conversely, North America is probably up about 10%.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew Casey","Just wanted to go back to an earlier question, I think it was Jamie, about segments within the NAFTA market. Are you seeing any increase in interest from the long haul truckload customers compared to earlier in the year that may support an expectation that the normal increase order activity towards the end of the year would take place?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. Our order intake has trended upward during the course of the year compared to if you look back to the latter parts of last year and we continue to see on-highway truck orders build quarter-on quarter.","Andrew Casey","Well, that's good to hear. Has vocational and energy remained strong for you folks?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, for sure. It's been a good order inflow in terms of the mix. Both of them have gone up and probably on-highway a little bit faster from an order standpoint than vocation.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker","A couple of numbers-related questions here for you. When you look at the cash flow statement, there's a pretty big negative outflow on working capital. It looks like receipt in most of that. Any additional color on that?","Ronald Armstrong","I think the biggest item was floor plan financing. I'll let Michael talk about that.","Michael Barkley","Yes. Last year, as our build rates were coming down and our inventories were -- dealer inventories were going down. We had an inflow from foreign receivables. And this year, as our build rates are coming up and our dealer inventories are going up, we're having an outflow with respect to that. So it's about a $400 million movement that you'll see moving that operating cash flow number. But as those trucks get delivered, they'll -- it'll become cash -- realized cash as the year progresses.","Ronald Armstrong","So the accounting rule, Mike has put that up in operating and the financing that we do for that is down in the investing section.","David Leiker","That's a good answer for that. And then just a follow-up question on currency, I want to see if we can dig a little bit deeper into it. With the strength in the euro here -- you had a couple of years of really weak euro. And from a transactional perspective would guess that that's probably positive for PACCAR with the euro going back up. Any way you can characterize how much of an impact a stronger euro might have on your growth profit dollars?","Ronald Armstrong","So we have a bit of a natural hedge with respect to the translation of our euro-based financial statements and we have euro-sourced components in the U.S. that we get the benefit of. So as the currency weakens and as it strengthens, we'll have more revenues and profits from DAF but that will be offset by some reduction then in the purchase cost for the components coming out of Europe. But it's a nice natural hedge that doesn't fully offset but it does offset [indiscernible].","David Leiker","At the line items, there's probably a little bit of a mismatch on gross profit versus SG&A.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, there is. There is. That's correct.","David Leiker","Okay. And then just one last item on the vertical integration, producing axles for trucks here in North America, you're doing engines here in North America. I mean the next logical step there would seem to be transmissions. Any thoughts on that?","Ronald Armstrong","We have great partners both in Europe with ZF and Eaton here in North America. We work very closely with them to have integrated customized solutions for our powertrains. And so we expect that to continue for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","Ron, I think, in the past we've talked about once we get past, hopefully get past, kind of a mid-cycle replacement kind of level of activity which seems to be kind of around where we're now in North America, that you have an opportunity hopefully for some pricing. Do you still view the market that way?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think the market is good. We feel good about where it's at. Obviously, if you look back at 2015, 278,000 truck market compared to 215,000 or so this year. That demand -- supply\/demand equation does provide some opportunities for pricing and so that could be in the future.","Stephen Volkmann","So if next year were to be higher, I'm not asking you to forecast that, but we might have a better pricing environment in that scenario?","Ronald Armstrong","It could be. Could be","Stephen Volkmann","Yes. And then can I ask you to maybe put on your long term prognostication, is that right, hat? And you've opened your new center down in Silicon Valley and thinking a little bit about the future of truck transportation, et cetera. When you think about that, things like battery-powered trucks maybe, I know you may have a new competitor soon, automated trucking, platooning, et cetera, do you have a view on which of those technologies is likely to be sort of sooner rather than later? And then sort of following onto that, do you feel like you want to do this kind of stuff internally to PACCAR? Or is this the kind of thing where you look for some partners and -- as you go forward? I'll let you answer that however you like.","Ronald Armstrong","That is a multifaceted question but a good question. So as we think forward, we're talking with a lot of suppliers who are very interested in partnering with us for a variety of technology paths that we may take. And so I'd say we're currently in that assessment phase of evaluating the best path for our company. And so part of opening this office is getting greater, more immediate access to the technologies and the technology development so that we can be better informed and make better decisions. And I think we'll start with this office in a relatively small way but I think it will probably grow as time goes on. And all those things will be parts of the areas of study that are done in this office. And we'll stay very close to those developments and continue to formulate the specifics of our strategy as we go through the next year or two.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. Any of those technologies kind of more attractive to you? Or maybe you're more skeptical about one or another?","Ronald Armstrong","No, I think the advanced driver assistance systems, those continue to progress. The camera technology, radar, lidar, all those technologies are developing pretty quickly. So I think they'll be the technology to support autonomy but how quickly will it actually happen in reality and for the next decades, you're going to have a majority of nonautonomous trucks on the streets. So it's going to be a transition and I'd say, a relatively gradual transition over time. So I think there will be progress in that area for sure. Batteries is just the size. There has to be a breakthrough in battery technology for there to be a economic -- economically viable solution for heavy-duty trucks. So again, we'll be very close to those developments. And as they occur, we work with a lot of potential partners in that arena now and we'll continue to stay close to that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher","I wonder if you could give us some color on how far out your backlog extends at this point and how that lead time has developed over the course of the year. Kind of curious how much of your second half production schedule is booked at this point.","Ronald Armstrong","We typically don't talk that extensively about backlog. I'll just tell you that they're very solid and in good shape. The backlog position has maintained sort of that strong position throughout the year and we've been able to increase the build rates in all of our markets as a result of that. So we're -- we feel good about the current build rate plans for the quarter -- for the next quarter and hopefully progressing through the rest of the year.","Steven Fisher","And are you taking a notable amount of orders for 2018 or is it too soon for that?","Ronald Armstrong","I think we're starting to see some. I wouldn't call it a notable amount, but there are some orders in the backlog for 2018 currently. But I think the discussion level about 2018 with, obviously, many of our larger customers, those discussions are starting to occur.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then just a quick one on the MX-11. How has that been performing from a warranty perspective? Do you have enough volumes to note any trends? And I know you mentioned that the currency was the big impact on the margins in the quarter. Did warranty have any notable impact on the margin this quarter?","Ronald Armstrong","No, no notable impact. The MX-11 is doing very well. The MX-11 was launched in Europe the fourth quarter of 2013 and we launched it here the beginning of 2016. And the engine has performed very well in both markets. And we're excited about the prospects for getting a greater penetration of that engine with our customers going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Barry Haimes of Sage Asset Management.","Barry Haimes","I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the medium duty market and kind of what you're seeing there just in terms of order rates, trends, et cetera.","Ronald Armstrong","This year, based on how we've produced medium duty trucks for the first half and our planned build rates for the second half, this could be a record medium duty production year for PACCAR. I think part of that is continued strong -- relatively strong market conditions, probably 50,000 to 55,000 trucks in Europe in the 6- to 16-tonne and in the class 6, 7 market, probably in the 80,000 to 90,000 truck range. And the Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF products are very well received in the markets and share positions are good. So like I said, this could be a record medium duty production year for PACCAR.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research.","Faheem Sabeiha","I'm sorry if I missed this, but following the strong performance of your Parts business in the first half of the year, what is your outlook now for the full year 2017?","Ronald Armstrong","So for the full year, we expect the global parts sales to be up in the range of 5% to 7% for the year.","Faheem Sabeiha","Okay. And can you comment on used truck inventory levels in the industry? I mean are they still excessive? And if fleets do plan to replace more trucks next year versus this year, I mean, can the market absorb these additional trucks entering the market?","Ronald Armstrong","Our used truck position is, I guess, I would characterize very normal. And I would say there probably still in the industry, there probably still are excessive trucks from some of the competitor mix. But -- so we feel good about our ability to manage our inventory in the near and midterm.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ken Hastings","Yes. I'd like to thank everyone for their participation. And thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you.

We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller; and Harrie Schippers, Senior Vice President.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks to the accomplishment of PACCAR's 23,000 outstanding employees around the world, 2016 was a very good year for the company. PACCAR achieved revenues of $17 billion and adjusted net income of $1.355 billion, a strong after tax return on revenues of 8%. Including the $833 million non-recurring charge with the European Commission settlement, net income was $522 million. 2016 was PACCAR's 78th consecutive year of earning a net income.","Last year's results reflect the strongest European heavy truck market since 2008, and excellent operating performance in truck operations around the world. In addition, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services generated good operating results.","PACCAR celebrated many important mile \u2013 important achievements in 2016. These included market share increases of a four percentage point in both the North American and European heavy-duty truck markets, the introduction of the PACCAR MX-11 engine in North America, the launch of the PACCAR tandem axle in North America, and the introduction of the DAF Connect Telematics System in Europe. DAF's registrations in the European above 16-tonne market were a record.","PACCAR invested $650 million of capital and R&D in premium quality products and services and facility enhancements to provide for future growth. PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.1 billion, and quarterly net income was $289 million. PACCAR delivered 33,900 trucks during the fourth quarter, in line with expectations. The profitable contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry.","PACCAR declared cash dividends of $1.56 per share last year, including a $0.60 per share special dividend declared in December. PACCAR has paid a dividend every year since 1941. During 2016, PACCAR repurchased 1.4 million shares of its stock for $71 million. PACCAR's total shareholder return was 38% in 2016 compared to 12% for the S&P 500.","PACCAR shareholder return has exceeded the S&P 500 return for the previous one-year, five-year, 15-year and 20-year time periods. In the first quarter of this year, vehicle truck deliveries, vehicle deliveries and truck and other gross margins are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved an excellent market share of 28.5% in the U.S. and Canadian heavy-duty truck market in 2016. Class 8 industry retail sales totaled 216,000 units the last year. And in 2017, we estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market would be in a range of 190,000 units to 220,000 units.","The market will be supported by estimated U.S. GDP growth of 2% to 2.5%, and industrial production growth projected at 1.5%. DAF increased its market share to 15.5% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year compared to 14.6% in 2015. The EU heavy-truck market was a robust 303,000 units in 2016. Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market will be another good, it'd be in the range of 260,000 vehicles to 290,000 vehicles.","Economic growth in Europe is expected to be a stable 1.5% this year. PACCAR Parts generated pre-tax profit of $544 million and revenues of $3 billion in 2016. The good results were driven by a growing population of PACCAR trucks and engines, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $765 million and pre-tax income of $138 million. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was 9% higher than the fourth quarter last year on a revenue increase of 2%. We expect Parts revenues to grow 2% to 4% this year.","PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $304 million in the fourth quarter and pre-tax income was $78 million. The good results benefited from the continuing strong portfolio performance. The Financial Services portfolio includes 178,000 trucks and trailers, including 38,000 PACCAR Leasing units. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pre-tax income of $307 million.","For 2017, PACCAR's research and development spending of $250 million to $280 million, and capital expenditures of $375 million to $425 million, will expand Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF product offerings, enhance the PACCAR Powertrain, build on advanced driver assistance and connected truck technologies, and increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our factories and distribution centers.","I'd like to recognize Bob Christensen for over 33 years of outstanding service to PACCAR. Bob is retiring tomorrow, and we wish he and his family the best. Harrie Schippers has been named Executive Vice President and CFO. I know many of you have met Harrie in the last six or seven years during his time as President of DAF Trucks and as Senior Vice President in our corporate group.","As the company begins its 112th year, we're in an excellent position to lead the industry with the highest quality products and services.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Morning, Ross.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a couple up front here. So first, just on the North American Class 8 market, I mean do you think orders have bottomed out at this point? And assuming that they have, if that's what you think, what quarter do you think Class 8 production bottoms out?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I guess based on our view of the market, I think the inventories, backlogs are pretty well in balance, and that order intake will be indicative of production, et cetera, going forward. So I would say that based on our market size estimates of 190,000 to 220,000, that we expect that production will improve as the year progresses.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And just also wanted to ask you about the UK. What kind of trends did you see sequentially from Q3 to Q4 in the UK? And do you get hit on FX, importing engines from the continent or anything in particular that you would note on FX that we should consider in our models for the UK?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So the UK market is DAF's largest market. It's been a great market. In fact, DAF set a all-time market share record in the UK market last year for the combined above 6- to 16-tonne, and above 6-tonne of 30%. So, our team has done a great job there, and we continue to see good demand from our customers. I think the economy there is good, and so there's been no indications. The movement in the pound following the Brexit vote, the movements are similar to what we've seen over the years, and while there is some headwind temporarily, that will adjust over time.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Alex.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Good morning. So, I guess following up there, more broadly on Europe. Just hoping you could try to help me understand maybe a little bit what's going on in the European truck cycle. From a high level, it seems like we're still below historical peak, and RLC Corps, seems like the European fleet maybe didn't go through a true up cycle. But now, everyone's guidance seems to suggest that the cycle is maybe taking a breather before running its full course. So, I'm just wondering if maybe the macro issues there are overpowering what would otherwise be a continued upturn or if you think that the cycle actually really did run its full course. So, I guess any additional color there would be helpful.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I think and last year, obviously, was a great year for the European truck market and DAF in particularly being able to improve its share a full percentage point in that market. If you look at the transportation statistics, the German MAUT statistics, December was another excellent month. Transport activity is at record highs across Germany, and so there's nothing near term that would say that the demand will tail off. I think we're being a bit conservative in how we view the market next year. We're actually starting the year at a higher production rate for our heavy-duty vehicles than we started last year. So, \u2013 but we're just a bit conservative in terms of how long that stays at that level.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. And then, I guess, one other one there. You've historically talked about in Europe, rolling out more Financial Services availability and expecting at least over the medium or long-term that, that would start to impact your market share in the truck segment. Just wondering the extent to which you believe that was one of the reasons behind your share gain over the last year in Europe, or whether you think the impact of the increased Financial Services is \u2013 has maybe yet to be felt and will be felt over the next couple of years.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, I think we're seeing \u2013 we've been open now in our Financial Services business for about two years or three years in Poland, Czech Republic, and we're seeing our share of the financing in those markets grow, and I think that also is translating into additional sales for DAF Trucks. DAF has a very strong position in the Central European countries.","And so, I think as we look forward, we are looking at expanding some of our financing activities into the Romanian market. We've opened our sales subsidiary in Turkey. And so, at some point, we'll have some financing capability there. We're also, while it's not in Europe, we're also going to be opening a bank in Brazil to support the financing of trucks, DAF Trucks in Brazil. So, we continue to grow our footprint and our Finance business around the world, and it's a integral part of the model that supports our trucks in all of our markets.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Interesting. Okay. Thanks very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. This is Ann Duignan. I hope everybody is okay out there.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","We know you.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Yes. You guide to U.S. and Canada per your outlook for here at this region. Could you talk a little bit about Mexico at South and what your expectations are there so that we can kind of reconcile our NAFTA outlook with your U.S., Canada?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I think Mexico will have another good year, probably in the 20,000- to 25,000-truck range would be how we would see that market for next year. Our \u2013 we continue to be the market leader in Mexico, the Kenworth brand is very well received. We've launched our 2.1-meter product, our MX engine. So they have all the latest products, and our dealers and our customers are very excited about the prospects to continue to have a excellent business in the Mexican market.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, the market will be okay, but you'd expect to outperform, is that what I hear you saying?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I think we know, I just think we'll continue to be at the \u2013 the market leader in the 35% to 40% share of the heavy-duty market.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Got you. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's good color. And then on gross margins, you had guided for full year 2017. What are you currently thinking on gross margins for 2017? It sounds like you might be a little bit more upbeat than you were at third quarter.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say the range for the year would be in the 13.5% to 14.5% range, and that will sort of tie in with those market ranges that we've talked about.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So, no change from Q3?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. No, I think that's still how we would view the year for next year.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And where do you see the biggest upside risk and the biggest downside risk? I mean I think your volumes might come in a bit better, if I'm not reading too much into what you're saying, and then where might the biggest headwinds be if \u2013 that we need to take into consideration?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I mean, typically, it's the level of demand and pricing in a given market. So, I think at the upper end of those ranges, there'll be opportunities for some pricing leverage; at the lower end, it's a competitive market, always has been and always will be. And so you just have to manage your pricing accordingly.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I'll let it go and get back in line. Thanks.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, David.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Good morning. The truck deliveries, fourth quarter to first quarter, can you help us a bit with the geographic mix of saying up a bit sequentially?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think it'd be up, that 1% to 2% increase in volume probably is all North America.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","And that just reflects additional production days. We shut our factories down during the Christmas holiday period in North America.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. Helpful. And on the gross margins, you're saying up a little bit from fourth quarter to first quarter, then the comment earlier about your U.S., Canada production sequentially improves throughout the year. So, the gross margins starting the year, make a number up, 14.1%, of the quarter was 13.9%. If you're already above the midpoint of the full-year guide and your U.S. production improves as the year goes on, why would it drag down as the year goes on? Is that a price cost comment or something about Europe we should infer from that statement?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think it's just predicated on the market continuing to improve as the year progresses.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","But if that was the case, if you're 14.1% or so to start the year, why would the rest of the year drag you back down to 14% or, for that matter, for the low end point?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, as I mentioned, the range is the 13.5% to 14.5%. So there's lots of room within that range.","David Raso - Evercore ISI Group","Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","A very good afternoon, I guess, depending on where you are. I guess just a couple questions. You mentioned to Ann, you think gross margins for the year will be 13.5% to 14.5%. But can you just comment, and I think everyone's trying to give this question specifically, what you're assuming for 2017 in terms of potential for material cost headwinds? And can price offset that specifically?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think in terms of commodity cost, I think there is a bit of a upward trend in terms of pressure on commodity cost. But our purchasing and materials and operations teams work very closely with our suppliers. We have long-term agreements that smooth the effects of commodity cost movements, and we have a continual effort on cost reduction activities. So we don't see material cost being a significant factor in the cost of our product in 2017.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But is price cost net positive, flat, just to be clear?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I'd say that the pricing environment in North America is probably a little more competitive in the second half of last year. As we started this year, Europe, I think is pretty flat. You just have the effects of sort of the pound-euro exchange rate that have some temporary effects.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right. So on the margin, a little bit of a headwind, it sounds like.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, yeah.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then I guess my second question, can you talk about what your assumptions are on the 13-liter for market share in 2017 versus 2016, and on the 11-liter? And then last question, sorry. Obviously, energy had been \u2013 has been a headwind for the broader group. Are you seeing any signs of pickup just based on some of where your dealers are located? Could that be a potential tailwind in 2017?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, I think that the PACCAR engine, around that 50% mark is sort of how we see the PACCAR engines, MX-11 and MX-13. And I think there is a bit of optimism about the energy market and the opportunities for next year, but again, that's not a significant element of our total business, but...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And you didn't see anything in the fourth quarter or January?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, no.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Tim.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, thank you. The first question was just on the used market in North America. Maybe you could just update us in terms of what you're seeing or what you have seen with respect to pricing.","And then just in terms of overall inventory levels, there has been some chatter here recently about some of the OEM groups \u2013 or I shouldn't say some, maybe one or two OEM groups holding abnormally high inventory levels. I'm just curious about your degree of confidence in the market's ability if, in fact, that's the case, to be able to kind of absorb that level of inventory.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure. From a pricing standpoint, if you look at today versus a year ago, prices are down about 10% for our product. We continue to maintain a premium relative to the competition in the used truck market. A lot of the trucks now that we're starting to see return and we will see return during this year will be our new 2.1-meter product, and that will even have a better value compared to some of our legacy products. So, we're actively engaged in working with our customers on lease returns, trade packages. We just opened our newest used truck facility in Chicago in December. So we're continuing to build our capabilities to handle additional volumes of used trucks. As time goes on, we're also looking at a couple of other locations during the course of this year. So we feel very comfortable with our ability to handle the volume of trucks that we're seeing in our inventory and will be coming back to us during the course of 2017.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. In that 10%, I know there are some quite big spreads between wholesale and retail, but would you \u2013 what would you put for the market, closer to 20%, in terms of year-over-year, and adjusting for model years and everything?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","All I know is our product and our prices.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, fair enough.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","And that average is 10%.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","For \u2013 okay. And then just on the raw material question, can you update us, I know that you had done some work in a factory a couple years ago in terms of some of the basically engineering out some cost. And I believe you were about two-thirds of production, North America had moved to that kind of updated model. Is that where we sit today? I'm just curious if there is more room to effectively increase that, those production of the models that, yeah.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. Part of our R&D budget last year, this year, will just be continued to enhance the product offerings of our 2.1-meter product line. And so it's 70%, 75% of what we do today, and it will continue to grow as the years progress. So, the favorable benefits of that will continue to be recognized.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Wondering what your outlook is for Parts margins from here. And I think the theory was that the more of your own engines you have out there and the more they're aging, the margin mix of your Parts business should start to get more robust. But where are you in that process? Because it looks like the margins have maybe leveled off a little bit.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. If you look back over a two or three year period, the margins in our Parts business have progressed nicely. And so, it depends a lot any given time on the mix of parts that you sell, et cetera. And we expect the percentage of engine parts to continue to grow gradually over time, and I think that will have a positive impact on margin percentages.","The other side of that is we're also growing and expanding our TRP capability. We ended the year with 77 independent TRP stores owned by our dealers. Those parts carry a lower margin, but they also give us additional volume, additional contact with additional customers, and is a great initiative that's really been a key focus of our dealers to take advantage of that opportunity to grow their presence in their market. So I think that there is a balance of puts and takes there.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So do you think that adds up to a higher Parts margin in 2017 versus 2016?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","The effects are going to be, I think, nominal.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then the Financial Services sequential profit improvement reversed a four-quarter slide. Were there any one-time benefits, and how should we think about the trajectory of Financial Services profit in 2017?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","As we look at 2017, I think the portfolio balance will be comparable to where it has been. A lot of the variations in profitability over the last eight quarters had been tied to used truck movements. And so, used trucks will play a significant part in how the profitability of the Financial Services segment performs in 2017.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So the fact that it's showing improvement, do you think that's also a reflection of the more balanced used market?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think there's, yeah, I that's a key element of it, and when you recognize the impact of lower used truck prices on your portfolio.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'm wondering if you could talk about the impact of dealer inventory destock on your Parts business in 2016. I think over the past couple of quarters, you mentioned that some dealers had reduced inventories. And now that the new order picture is clearing up, I'm wondering if we could see some inventory stocking in 2017. Can you just frame the order of magnitude for us?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, our dealer inventories have been in great shape, really, throughout 2016 and as we enter 2017. If anything, our dealers probably could use a few more trucks, and we're seeing some good orders early on in 2017 for inventory. So, I think the Parts impact of that is, I mean, it's sort of business as usual.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I'm wondering if you could talk about how far out your lead times extend in Europe. You spoke about starting the year at higher build rates than a year ago. How much visibility do you have? What was book-to-bill in the fourth quarter, if you're willing to share it, for Europe specifically?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I'd just say our backlogs are in excellent shape all around the world in all of our businesses, and Europe is right in line with that. So we're very comfortable with our backlogs, and they're really balanced in with order intake and demand in the markets right now.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And on pricing, in the 10-Q for last quarter, Mexico was a significant headwind. I'm wondering if you can talk about, is that continuing? Is that what you alluded to in the prior Q&A as a headwind in North America, and how much of that is currency driven?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","One more time, Jerry? I missed the first part.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","The pricing situation in Mexico.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Okay. Sure.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, you just talked about a significant headwind in the third quarter 10-Q, and I'm wondering, is that situation continuing into the first quarter here? And would you attribute that to the currency moves, and any other color you can give us on what's playing out on that market from a pricing standpoint?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't \u2013 I don't know if we said significant headwind, that doesn't make sense to me. But with the depreciating peso, that's a \u2013 it's a competitive market. And so you \u2013 we try to \u2013 we basically sell in U.S. dollars. So, we've got to work with customers to balance their ability to invest in new equipment and our ability to sell it at a fair price.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And so, if the currency continues to move in the direction it's been trending up over the past, call it, one quarter to two quarters, do you have any opportunities to mitigate the currency impact on your sales into Mexico, maybe a small assembly operation, anything along those lines we should be thinking about?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","We produce, for Mexico, we produce all of our trucks in Mexico. So, we don't have cross-border matters to deal with there. So, but a lot of the components come from U.S. suppliers, as they always have.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Morning, David.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, this is actually Joe for David.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Joe.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","You've been giving order share in the U.S., Canada market in recent quarters. Is it possible to get an update of maybe where that was during Q4?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, so for the full year, Peterbilt and Kenworth were at 32% share of the order intake, and I think for the fourth quarter, just under 30% in the fourth quarter.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. So, given share has been so high recently, and I think you've talked in the past, it's a competitive market, it's tough to maintain such a magnitude of a jump that PACCAR has seen, are you seeing maybe greater inroads? And thinking about the 2017 environment, particularly the two European OEMs entered 2016 with very high inventory, maybe they start to come back a bit?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Our guys \u2013 we have great products, and I think the market has always recognized the premium value of Kenworth and Peterbilt in North America, and DAF in Europe, and our teams are working hard to sell those great products. It's a premium value at a premium price, and not everybody is willing to pay that, but we've grown our share over time in both markets, and our goal is to continue to increment share as we progress over the coming years.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then maybe a similar conversation in Europe, I think what people might be trying to figure out is an industry forecast, minus 9% in 2017, you're going to start up. It sounds like you started to see some softening in particular countries as the UK softened at year-end. And so, is that difference between DAF and the industry, just your order intake and your backlog, and that's what's driving it?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think our market assumption, as I mentioned previously, is probably a bit conservative based on where we're at currently, but the UK market has been pretty steady. And we've gotten good orders this year into the UK and all of our markets around the market. So I think we're in good shape as we enter 2017.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ronald E.

Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So my first question is just around, I guess, the tone of conversations that you're having with dealers and customers in the U.S. Just we've got improvement in the PMIs and it feels like general business sentiment is getting better. So just curious if you're seeing that reflected in your conversations with dealers and customers as well.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I might let Bob address that for North America and let Harrie comment on the Europe situation.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","I think that's a correct assessment, that the tone of conversations is generally positive. We just came back from the American Truck Dealers meeting in New Orleans this past weekend, and I would say dealers are looking optimistically towards the year. Quote activity seems to be normalized, and it should be a very good year for the truck industry once again in 2017.","Harrie C. A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc.","And in Europe, I think I can confirm that business and industry confidence levels are at high levels. Freight, like Ron mentioned, is at good strong levels, and as a result, our order and backlog is in good shape.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks. And this one is kind of nitpicky, but I'm getting to the bottom of my question list here. Just why did you guys opt to cut R&D guidance for 2017? Is there anything significant there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Nothing significant. As we dialed in our budgets for next year and looked at our product plans, that's the amount we need to continue to support the product and build our business. So, I think we are very \u2013 just a little bit sharpening of the pencil, as I say.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Ronald E.

I know in Europe, I know Harrie just talked about it being in good shape. Was that up, down or flat?","Ronald E.

A. M. Schippers - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, the total order intake for DAF in the fourth quarter in the heavy segment was up 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to 2015.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, rest of world volume has been steadily growing through 2016. Can you give a little color as to what regions were driving that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we continue to increment our build in Brazil. It's a difficult market, but our team is step-by-step increasing production and increasing their market share, and Mexico was \u2013 a good year for Mexico. Australia, the mining sector is \u2013 has slowed, but we just launched our new T610 product in Australia, and their backlog is starting off very strong and we'll be looking at some build rate increases in Australia in the coming weeks. And we are seeing some increasing demand in markets like Russia, that the demand for Euro 5 vehicles is increasing, and DAF is doing a good job of getting their share of that additional demand in Russia.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's good news. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Seth.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning and good afternoon. I just wanted to go \u2013 a couple quick questions. On Brazil, you mentioned that the market is obviously still tough, but your volumes are increasing and your absorption should be getting better. Is there a kind of a critical mass that we should be thinking about for that region or for your production where, I don't know if you'll comment or not, but is that facility breakeven for you or profitable for you today, or can that sort of flip from losing money to making money any time soon, if you can comment on that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think a lot \u2013 just it all really depends on the economic developments in the country. And we've seen two years of contraction of over 3%, the expectations for this year is more of a flat development, but the Brazilian economy and the Brazilian \u2013 the Brazilians have a lot going for them in terms of resources, agricultural capability. So I think we feel very comfortable long-term with our investment, and as time goes on, it will provide a good return to our shareholders.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","But at current levels, though, it's still a drag to you?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","It is, yes.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then just, I guess, a follow-up question. As production volumes get better just across the company or North America, I guess, kind of given the puts and takes around material cost and things like that, is there an incremental margin that you're comfortable talking to as volumes get better?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think if you just look at the history of incremental and decremental margins, I think that's how you should think about us going forward.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So something like the 20% range or so?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, exactly.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky of Seaport Global.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Just following up on Seth's question about Brazil. Does opening a bank in Brazil help you ramp up the market share penetration? It's been roughly 1% a year for a couple years now. Does it make it any more of a positive tailwind on that, either 2017 or 2018?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yes. For sure, it does, and that's our whole drive behind our finance business, is profitably supporting the sale of PACCAR products around the world, and Brazil is no different. And as we have that financing capability, that will enhance DAF's ability to sell to more customers in the Brazilian market.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","So, if you have been getting about 1% a year, could you maybe get you to 2% a year of additional share going forward? Just kind of help us to quantify the upside here.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I can't really comment on that. I think there's some benefit there. We've been able to get that share here. The product is performing great. We have a great team that represents the DAF brand in the market. And I'm totally confident that we'll continue to grow our share, whatever pace that might be, and that, yeah, the finance company, all other things being equal, will enhance that share growth.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then secondly, I saw on your issue, you've got a Toronto Parts DC opening. Is that going to open in 2017? And would that be serving?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, it will probably be a mid 2018. We're just finalizing the purchase of the land and there will be a permitting process, and so construction will start probably mid-year this year and then finalize mid-year 2018.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Is that going to serve just Canada or will it also serve the Eastern U.S.? And I was curious as to what kind of operation you are placing there. Is that going to be a good margin efficiency improvement like we saw in Renton this year?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I was just in that, our current Toronto Distribution Center about two weeks ago, and the team does a great job in a 55,000-square-foot facility. This will triple the amount of space. We have a growing business, both our dealers and our customers in that area, and this will allow them to grow their parts business in that area and better support a growing base of customers. So, just you saw us build the Renton PDC this last year, which doubled the amount of square footage. We expanded our PDC in Lancaster in Pennsylvania, that really supports the Northeastern part of the U.S. We have a Distribution Center in Montr\u00e9al that supports customers in Qu\u00e9bec. So, this particular PDC is primarily focused on the Ontario area and Middle Canada.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Longbow Research.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Neil.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Thanks. Yeah. I believe a few years ago, you indicated that Kenworth and Peterbilt U.S. and Canada Class 8 vocational truck share was above 40%. Is that still the case today? And I guess as a follow-up, could you just talk about order activity for the segment in the market and the prospects from higher infrastructure spending potentially coming in 2018?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I think that share position is still about right. In terms of demand in that arena, I think demand has been pretty consistent. And for sure, if there is substantial infrastructure investment, I think that would bode well for our ability to sell more trucks into that segment. So, the Peterbilt and Kenworth products do great in that area.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Could you also talk about your industry outlook for the U.S. and Canada in medium-duty market versus 2016, whether you expect that to be flat, up or down?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think fairly flat.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. Congrats, Bob.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Wertheimer of Barclays.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Could you talk about, you mentioned Russia earlier, where are we versus peak in Russia and what's the outlook for the next two, three years, I mean, gradual strengthening your return? And maybe just a second comment, we have data on used truck pricing, which you alluded to in the North American market. What is European used truck pricing like, up or down or flat?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I'd say European used truck pricing is relatively flat. In terms of the Russian market, we're probably still on the ascent in terms of a couple years ago, the market was stronger. DAF sold about 3,000 trucks into Russia. Last year, it was just under 1,000 trucks. And so, there is good upward trend, but certainly more upside potential.","Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sam Rathod of Macquarie.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Good mooning. Sameer Rathod.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","There has been a lot of discussion by the current administration about reducing regulation, including environmental. Do you think this is a net positive or negative for intermediate truck demand? Because on one hand, you have newer standards historically helping driving replacement cycles, on the other hand, reduced regulation may spur business activity.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","We're preparing for the regulations as they exist currently. It's difficult to plan based on speculation, and so we're developing our products for the future, following the greenhouse gas regulations that are in place. So, if those change, we will reevaluate our plans and adapt accordingly.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So can you share the \u2013 sorry, if I missed it, what you're expecting for Parts revenue growth this year and Financial Services margins?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So Parts revenue growth, I indicated we expect 2017 to be 2% to 4% growth rate. Financial Services margins, I think were \u2013 probably see our spreads be relatively steady, and I think a big factor in the results would be the movement of used truck values, but our portfolio in our Finance business is performing excellently. Our team generated a share of 26% of all PACCAR products sold that they financed last year. And so the finance team continues to manage their business in a very prudent way, and generate a good contribution to PACCAR's results.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, just secondly, can you just talk about the percent of your U.S. cost of goods sold that are imported into the U.S.? And then maybe just broadly, how you're thinking about any potential changes you might want to make if we get a border adjustment tax?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","That's \u2013 a lot of speculation on trade matters, and so we'll address those as they come at us. We source materials from all over the world, majority out of the U.S., I don't know what that percentage might be. But we're \u2013 we source just as all the automotive and commercial vehicle industry does. So whatever the effects might be for us would be similar for the industry.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So you're saying that you don't want to give a number in terms of how much of your U.S. cost of goods are imported, but you're saying you wouldn't think it's any different than any other OEM?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I don't think it's any different.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Last and least, I'm used to that.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Hey. The best for last with Joel. That's how I look at it.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Something like that. And then, so just there's been a lot of questions, so I'll make it quick. But the fourth quarter, the drop-off in the gross margin and the profitability is really just from end of year adjusting inventory, cleaning out, whatever, getting rid of some new unused product, and feeling some of the pricing pressure that's been evident in the market to set up for 201. Is that fair?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think there is a bit of competitive pricing pressure, the pound-euro exchange rate had some effect. In our fourth quarter, we typically will do some projects in our factories, so we have some maintenance projects that we do over the shutdown period. And so just normal stuff, so nothing unusual.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then there was a slide from your December presentation that you \u2013 it suggested at least that you're going to capture some parts sales from the more technologically advanced stuff, like adaptive cruise control and lane departure warning system. Can you give me a sense of how can you do that? Those are someone else's \u2013 those are mostly someone else's parts. And so, I just \u2013 I don't know, it's hard for me to understand that. But I'm not the brightest guy in the planet either.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","So, Joel, we sell a combination of our captive parts, as well as vendor supplied parts that we bring into our warehouse and have available for dealers. We manage that dealer inventory, and as parts for those systems are consumed at retail, then we will resupply the dealer from our warehouses. But we have access to all parts that are used on PACCAR products around the world.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. So, just maybe a little bit less markup just because there is more hands touching it or something like that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's fair.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. I'm not getting back in queue. Thank you very much.","Ronald E.

We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's, Director of Investor Relations, and joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.","I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Harrie Schippers and I will provide you an update on PACCAR's excellent third quarter results and business highlights. To begin, I'm proud of our employees around the world who provide our customers the highest quality trucks, powertrains, and transportation solutions.","In the third quarter PACCAR achieved sales and financial services revenues of $6.4 billion and net income of $608 million, resulting in a strong 9.5% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR net income increased 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. PACCAR achieved robust truck, parts, and other gross margins of 14.9% in the third quarter, and also for the year to date.","Through the first nine months of the year, our team achieved record revenue and earnings. PACCAR delivered 49,300 trucks during the third quarter, compared to 52,200 in the second quarter. This reflects fewer billing days in Europe, due to DAF's regular summer shutdown, which was partially offset by higher deliveries in North America.","In the fourth quarter, deliveries will be lower by 6% to 8% compared to the third quarter, due to fewer production days in North America and lower daily build rates in North America and Europe. Fourth quarter truck, parts and other gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%.","PACCAR declared third quarter dividends of $0.32 per share and year-to-date dividends of $0.96 per share. Year-to-date dividends were 19% higher than dividends declared in the same period last year. We repurchased 833,000 shares of stock during the third quarter, and there is $431 million remaining in the current $500 million Board of Directors' authorization.","PACCAR continues to create a full lineup of innovative truck models and technologies. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have introduced a range of electric powertrain vehicles in the last two years, that customers are field testing in a variety of applications. PACCAR is well positioned to supply the industry with a complete set of powertrain technologies, including battery electric, fuel cell and diesel engines.","This year, PACCAR has opened two global software research and development centers in the U.S. and Europe that are accelerating the development of embedded vehicle software, and PACCAR connected vehicle solutions for our customers.","The PACCAR Innovation Center in the Silicon Valley, which we opened in 2017, complements PACCAR's extensive R&D efforts, and is focused on the development of PACCAR level 2 and 4 autonomous trucks. PACCAR will showcase many of our innovative products and technologies at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show in Atlanta next week, and at the CES Technology Show in Las Vegas in January. We hope to see you there.","We are pleased to share that Kenworth, Peterbilt and PACCAR parts were each recognized as top employers for women at the Women in Trucking Annual Conference. We were honored for excellent work environment and company culture, that supports gender diversity.","Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR's truck segment, PACCAR Parts, Financial Services and investment priorities for next year.","Harrie Schippers","Thanks Preston.","Our 2019 forecast, for Europe's greater than 16-tonne truck market, to be in a range of 310,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting continued modest economic growth and strong truck demand. Next year, the Eurozone and U.K. economies are expected to grow about 1%. We expect 2020 to be another good year, with the European above 16-tonne truck market in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles.","The U.S. economy is growing 2.3% this year, with 50-year low unemployment, and strong consumer spending. Freight tonnage has grown 4.2% year-to-date. In the U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry retail sales continue to grow in 2019, following the strong orders and production over the last two years.","We estimate 2019, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales to be in the range of 310,000 to 320,000 trucks. We expect 2020 to be another good economy, and estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck markets to be in the range of 230,000 to 260,000 trucks, in line with normal replacement demand.","The South American above 16-tonne truck market should be in the range of 95,000 to 105,000 trucks this year, and slightly higher in 2020. In Brazil, the above 16-tonne truck segment is projected to be in a range of 65,000 to 75,000 vehicles this year and slightly higher next year. PACCAR Parts business generated strong quarterly revenues of $1 billion.","Quarterly pre-tax income was $207 million, 10% higher than the third quarter last year. Consistent investments in parts distribution capacity, customer focus programs such as fleet services and TRP Stores, and a growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operations, drove these results.","Since 2013, DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers have opened nearly 200 TRP retail stores on six continents. The stores provide high quality TRP branded, aftermarket products and services to owners of all makes of trucks, trailers, buses and engines. PACCAR Parts is constructing two new distribution centers, that will open next year.","A 250,000 square foot facility in Las Vegas, which will make efficient use of solar power and 160,000 square foot facility in Ponta Grossa, Brasil. We expect part sales to grow by 4% to 6% next year.","PACCAR Financial Services earned third quarter pre-tax income of $67 million. The portfolio was a record $15.6 billion this quarter, and performed well, with low past dues. In the third quarter, industry used truck inventory increased, and used truck pricing declined. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 15% premium in the market.","We estimate 2019 capital spending to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million, and R&D expenses to be $325 million to $335 million. In 2020, we're planning for capital investments of $625 million to $675 million, and R&D expenses of $320 million to $350 million. These investments will continue to enhance PACCAR's truck, powertrains and transportation solutions.","Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Wow, I'm not used to be in first. How is it going guys? Wow, first time for everything, I guess. So I just wondered if you could give us any sense of production levels for 2020, after mentioning, kind of -- we got a sense where the industry is going to be, and then mentioning that inventories for the industry are up a little bit? And I just wondered if you could give us any sense of where your production -- where you're thinking for 2020?","Preston Feight","Sure, as we've watched the industry normalize, if you look at inventory, we really think that right now, it's not in that shape at all for us. We just have 2.4 months of inventory retail sales sitting out there, so that's a nice level. In good shape. We've already adjusted our backlog to be -- we have 36% of the backlog in the industry. So that's in good shape.","And then as we look forward and think about build rates, we took adjustments into the -- end of the third quarter there, both North America and Europe to get them right for the markets, so that we feel like we've got a reasonable build going into 2020.","Joel Tiss","And can you give us any sense about the parts, margins, I could see and we can all see in 2019, the margins are up a little bit, profits growing faster than revenues. You gave us a revenue number for next year, is there enough momentum in the business and the new parts distribution centers to be able to do that again in 2020, you think?","Preston Feight","I think the guidance we gave on the 4% to 6% growth, and I think margins would likely be comparable to what we saw this year.","Harrie Schippers","In the 27% to 28% range, that's what we typically see for parts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen Volkmann","I'm not used to Joel being first either.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann","But maybe I'll pile on to his question a little bit. So Preston, just thank you for the comments around sort of production expectations. Is it your expectation at this point, that the production declines that you've kind of baked in for -- here in the second half of 2019, will be enough, and that you'll be able to sort of keep stable through 2020, is that the way, the plan is laid out?","Preston Feight","I think we'll watch what happens in 2020. I don't think it's going to be an even year, every month will be different. I mean every quarter will be different. So we'll make sure that we adjust build rate appropriate to the orders we have. Right now we have reasonable backlog in the first quarter, especially in North America. So we feel like we've got ourselves about right and we'll watch as the year comes along, what we need to do, whether it's go up or down in build rate.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, understood. And can we talk, maybe this is a Harrie question, just a little bit about the decremental margins since -- I guess it will be decremental next year. You've done a good job holding your incrementals kind of in the mid-teens, with an occasional high teens kind of number. I'm just curious as you have sort of more vertically integrated a little bit with your engine growth in the U.S. and all these parts distribution centers, etcetera. Do you think your decremental margin will also be in that kind of mid-teens level, or is there a reason to think it could be higher, because of the additional investment?","Harrie Schippers","I think we've -- historically we've seen incremental and decremental margins in the 15% to 20% range and I would expect that to be similar for next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew Casey","A couple of questions. First on the Financial Services and this is kind of picking at it, but SG&A and provision for losses on receivables were up a little bit sequentially and year-over-year, what was driving that change, and was it due to any specific region?","Preston Feight","What we saw in Financial Services, we've had really a low credit losses. We've had low past dues. The portfolio continues to perform really well. In fact, we're pretty pleased with that portfolio. The only headwind we've had in Financial Services was used trucks.","Andrew Casey","And then, I just want to make sure I have this right, if I compare the truck segment performance to Q3 '18, you had a pretty beneficial gross spread between the 12% revenue increase, and the 3% volume growth. And I recall Q3 last year had some timing issues related to buyback contracts and stuff like that. Was that the difference in the revenue growth and the volume growth really driven by comps and pricing, or was there something else that occurred in the quarter?","Preston Feight","Yes, if you just think about what this quarter was about, we did have reasonable pricing influence, that more than offset costs. So I think those are the things that drove our stronger margin performance for the quarter. I don't know if I've gone back in terms of kind of a bridge to the 3Q of '18 numbers and what was going on back in there. We did have fewer operating lease deferrals in Q3 of '19 versus Q3 of 2018, and therefore, that that helped our revenue a bit.","Andrew Casey","And then on the used truck market in North America, you mentioned inventories are growing I think, have you started to see the price trends kind of gradually decline? Are we starting to see more double digit?","Preston Feight","So if you think about used trucks, one of the things that has been nice for PACCAR, is we've made investments over the past few years to grow our used truck capability. We created a new used truck center in Los Angeles. We're in the middle of creating one in Denton, Texas, it will open in the fourth quarter. Obviously PACCAR's used trucks provide a premium value in the marketplace.","So that's a nice thing for our customers, and really have a 10% to 15% premium over our competitors. And actually sometimes, more than that compared to some of the competitors. But we have seen the used truck market in general, go into that double digit level of declines on that 10% to 15% decline, and that's already been kind of dealt with through this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Yes, our data that we analyze and publish shows that while you do garner a premium in the used market, you're seeing these prices are down year-over-year just like everybody else's. So thank you for confirming that. My question is around the month of inventory at your dealer, it has been, you know 2.4 months, but that's based on a trailing 12 month -- trailing sales, which are at a peak. So isn't it inevitable, that as we go into next year, those months of supply at the dealers are going to expand, and you're going to have to cut production. So could you just talk about that, and why you wouldn't have to under-produce retail sales going into next year, despite the fact that you got higher backlog?","Preston Feight","Well, I think -- maybe that's a little bit less than I would think about it. And I think we feel like the inventory, while you admit it, while you acknowledge is trailing run rate. We still do talk to our dealers all the time and our customers all the time, and we see that there will be good demand for the products, as we look forward.","So I would say that, the last quarter's order intake has been lower, but as we get into the fourth quarter and we're meeting with customers, talking about what next year's buying pattern is going to be, I expect people will be buying trucks, and I think that indeed the occasional market seems to continue to be very solid throughout the country, throughout Canada. So I would expect that our inventory is okay. As far as adjustments go to production, like we said earlier, I think we make those adjustments up and down, as the market demands it.","Ann Duignan","Yes, that's for sure. And then just based on your guide's history. I know the truck cycles over the long term and a lot of them have been manmade. But if we're going into a decline in 2020, for whatever reason, have we ever seen a cycle that's on a one year decline, or should we be bracing for a couple of years and then back to normal again. Just your perspective on that from your years of experience will be beneficial. Thanks.","Preston Feight","Yes, that's a tough thing to forecast out what kind of a decline rate there would be. And if it might last longer than a year. I think we probably look at this and say, there are still strong economic fundamentals in the U.S. and Canada right now. GDP is positive, tonne miles are high.","I think, we think there is normalizing of the market estimate of 230,000 to 260,000 is just -- kind of feels like where things are happening too. As far as it being beyond next year. No idea if it's just a pause in the economy, and that it will reaccelerate, or if it will slow down for more than a year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.","Erin Welcenbach","This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my question for you is, just how firm does the backlog look from an industry perspective, and when would you expect order activity to pickup this year, if at all?","Preston Feight","Sure. Well, I think that we've already done a good job of looking into our backlog and working with our customers, just to make sure that we had real backlog, and that if there were cancellations, we took them. If there were different scheduling needs, we've addressed them. I can't speak for the total industry, but I feel like -- we feel like our backlog is in a reasonable shape right now.","Erin Welcenbach","And then my second question is just, maybe if you can provide some additional color on your thoughts for Europe, and any regional variances you would expect next year, given your outlook for double digit declines in sales.","Preston Feight","One of the things we've seen in Europe has been -- that the U.K. has done quite nicely for us this year. So in spite of all the news around it, and maybe that will continue. We also are the leading brand of tractors throughout Europe. And as we watch Europe really expand East -- continue to expand east in development, our DAF premium products do a great job throughout all of Europe, and we have market leadership in countries like Poland and we are strong in Hungary and Romania and those kinds of countries. So as the total market of Europe matures, DAF does very well, enables us to grow share there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Benjamin Burud","This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. Just wanted to spend a few more minutes on Europe. So the second quarter of production adjustments in a row it seems, and it seems to be the main driver of deliveries, only increasing 3% year-over-year in the quarter. I believe your guide three months ago was 5% to 7%. So can you just spend a little more time on what drove the softness there, if that's continuing? And if you guys like to flex production over there, on a quarterly basis or if there is second production adjustment, what was more of a surprise, any color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Preston Feight","Sure. I think I think your comments are reasonably accurate, as we did take the adjustments to Europe, to where -- a point where it matched the market demand. And we've seen that we've held onto our market share gains with our build rates. So we're setting at like 16.4%, which is near historic highs for us, in market share.","So we think we have it balanced about right now. And Europe was probably a little sooner coming down than maybe we thought it might be, and that's why we made the necessary adjustments, and it feels like we're setting the right levels.","Benjamin Burud","And then, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about dealer location growth next year, for the TRP locations? Are you still thinking of adding 50 new locations per year, and any expected increase in Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers in 2020?","Preston Feight","Yes. We have -- I mean I'll start by just saying, we have the best dealer network in the industry, and I mean spent a lot of time with them. They're fantastic business partners. We see significant investments from them in North America and in Europe.","So it's one way to think about this, is that they're constantly renewing their facilities, and adding service bays and shop capability, to make sure our customers maximize their uptime. And so we'll watch next year that they'll continue to make those investments into new facilities, with lots of great plans around adding locations.","And we'll see some location growth in North America. What I'd expect more in Europe, is it will be -- the continuing development of replacement locations and improved service bay capability or more service bay capability. And to your point of, TRP Stores, we will be adding TRP Stores in 2020 as well, probably much along the lines as we have, in this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Timothy Thein","First question, just on a -- from a mix standpoint, this revenue per truck that -- call it 10% or almost 10% year-over-year growth, was that just all that contribution from North America being a bigger part of the deliveries, or is there kind of underlying content growth or mix story that's also contributing?","Preston Feight","No, you've got it about right. It's mostly contribution from North America.","Timothy Thein","Okay.","Harrie Schippers","Pricing improvement, right?","Preston Feight","Yes.","Timothy Thein","Right, okay. And then just back on the Financial Services and the pre-tax profits; in terms of the increase, I know that we have limited disclosure here in the release. But the increase in that interest and other line, how much of that is a change in terms of higher depreciation, that we will potentially be sustained going forward, versus maybe impairments or losses on used, that are presumably more one-time in nature? And the spirit of the question is just, should we assume a kind of a similar run rate in terms of a -- from a profitability perspective in the third quarter, or were there some kind of one timer's within that line? Thank you.","Preston Feight","So as far as the continuing to profitability, we think the strong profits we had in the third quarter will continue going forward and for the detail of your question, I will let Michael want to address that one.","Michael T. Barkley","Yes. We did have some impairments that were taken, and we also adjusted our depreciation to reflect expected future impairments. And so that run rate will continue going forward. And as Preston indicated, will be reflected at a similar pace in coming quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","I'm just trying to understand gross margins in a more draconian scenario than what you're forecasting for next year. I mean, I think if you go back in gross margins ex R&D in more of a garden-variety downturn have been around 12% to 13%. But you've got to go back like seven or eight years to see it. I'm just wondering, how do you think gross margins look in the next downturn, whenever it comes, in relation to that 12% to 13%, given the way the company has evolved over the last decade, particularly with the growth in the Parts business?","Preston Feight","I think one of the great strengths of PACCAR, is that we are always looking at operational efficiency gains, not just in one year, but over the course of time. We're always thinking about cost control.","So as we head into markets like the normalized market we're facing, we've already been aggressively thinking about cost control, and I think that's enabled us to deliver the solid gross margins we had this quarter, and even the quarterly gross margins we predict for next quarter in 14% to 14.5%. So I think that we are always managing the business efficiently for the benefit of our customers, and we think that 14% to 14.5% that we deliver next quarter will be pretty solid.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, I mean, I realize that. I wasn't asking about next quarter. I'm not asking you for it to forecast when the next trough is. I'm just saying, when eventually it does come, what do you think your gross margins would look like with -- in comparison to what prior downturns looked like? I mean, I imagine you're -- it has been very difficult to stay in the 14% to 14.5% range, if Class 8 build -- goes to sub 200,000 number.","Preston Feight","Well, that's kind of hypothetical to us. Just to think where it might go down to and how we might react in those circumstances. But you can imagine, that we will always be focused on cost control, and we have a long, long history of all different markets back through the recession of 2009, and we still continue with profitability and we'll continue to do a good job in those, even if those circumstances were to return, which we don't predict.","Ross Gilardi","How quickly can you reduce SG&A, as Class 8 production normalizes, and what will be the source of the savings? And just how should we think about SG&A into next year, as we revert back to replacement level demand? I mean if we model it at 2.3% of sales or so for this year, does it stay at that ratio in 2020, as production normalizes, or do we see it -- the ratio move higher?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think what we're always looking for in those in SG&A, and in our spending is to make sure that we are developing the right products and services for customers looking into the future. And so as we shared, we think the level of spending for us on R&D and capital our capital come down a little bit. R&D is roughly flat, and I think in SG&A, we will apply rigorous disciplines, to make sure that the costs are appropriately controlled.","Ross Gilardi","And is that just from flexing the workforce, or what are the other -- is that the main source of savings, if -- when you get to that point?","Preston Feight","Workforce is one, contracts is another, licensing agreements, work we do, those kinds of things, all get looked at. We really don't think of things in terms of a lot of fixed pricing.","Harrie Schippers","We go through our overhead budgeting process every year, as a zero based budgeting process, and we review all necessary spending in detail and make sure that we're keeping our organization as lean as possible.","Ross Gilardi","And then can you just remind us the percentage of your European deliveries that come from the U.K.? I seem to remember, it's around 20%, is that in the right ballpark? And can you remind us what portion of Leyland's capacity sold to the U.K. market versus the European Union? I mean on that note, could you shift production out of the U.K. to DAF in the Netherlands to serve Europe, if we did go through a hard Brexit?","Preston Feight","So I as we think about the U.K. one of the beautiful things for us is, we have great production capacity in the U.K. We also have it in Eindhoven, and so we were able to flex depending on what Brexit might or might not be appropriately for the market, so we can build the trucks we need in the U.K., in U.K., and we can build all the trucks, the CFXs we need for the continent, we can build on the continent as well. So that gives us good flexibility, and I think Harrie, you were looking at the number...","Harrie Schippers","The U.K. typically is between 15% and 20% of our European production.","Ross Gilardi","So most of the existing production, at least for a year like this year, would just be -- would be for the U.K. market out of the U.K. factory?","Preston Feight","Yes, that's -- we can use it for both, and we have enough there to support the U.K. and we have enough capacity in Europe to support Europe.","Harrie Schippers","And being the only truck manufacturer that has a factory in the U.K., that could give us a very nice advantage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","I guess one question, as you're thinking about the commentary that you made about decrementals of the 15% to 20% or so, are there any variances or differences as we think about where the weakness is coming from, are the decrementals dissimilar and the U.S. and Europe are not so much anymore with being more vertically integrated the U.S. now. And then I guess my second question regards to -- relates to sort of price costs. Obviously pricing has been pretty strong for you guys this year, and the downturn that you guys are forecasting, do you think you can hold sort of price in that material cost could potentially be a tailwind for you? Thank you.","Preston Feight","Yes, I think it will be -- your second part of question is quite possibly true, and we'll continue to manage price to best of our ability in the market, and we are always aggressively looking at our cost structure. And, as you mentioned, that could be a bit of a tailwind for us, in terms of what happens next year, as in 2019, suppliers are running at full capacity, some inefficiencies in their ships. So maybe there's some upside in that.","Jamie Cook","And just the first part, difference U.S. versus Europe in terms of impact on margins?","Preston Feight","Yes, they're very similar, very similar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Courtney Yakavonis","I just wanted to go back to the clarification on the comments on your build rate being appropriate for the orders you have right now in the backlog for the first quarter. So is your assumption then that -- at the beginning of 2020, that we should return to that kind of replacement rate of 20,000 orders a month? Or is your current build rate kind of assuming, that we remain at this sub-15,000 orders, and the backlog can fill in the rest. And then also just wanted to make sure that the comment was, that the September build rate is the right assumption we should have, going forward?","Preston Feight","Well, we've made adjustments in the first parts of October for our build rates, so this is coming at that. So we think we've got that set up right. When I think about our backlog and build rates for next year, we still have quite a healthy backlog, and so there could be a little bit of a more time for the normalization to that quarter intake of 20,000 per month, as you put the number out there.","But orders are definitely starting to pick up. It's a very normal part of the cycle to have late summer be quiet, and then as people are putting their capital budgets into place, then to see the fourth quarter be a time of ordering, and we're seeing that right now. So whether it's going to be exactly at level this month or it will take a month or two to normalize out, it should normalize out.","Courtney Yakavonis","But it sounds like before the beginning of the year, you do expect that return. And then just on CapEx and R&D, you gave us guidance for 2020 and I think there's a bit of a step-down in CapEx versus '19 but still an elevated level, relative to what's historically seen out of you guys. So is that kind of the right run rate that we should be thinking about, the investments that you're -- that the business kind of needs at this point, or a lot of those one-time in nature? And then kind of same question on R&D, which is expecting to pick up, and especially in light of concerns about decrementals next year. Are there any buckets in R&D that potentially could be factored in as well.","Preston Feight","Sure. For both of them as far as -- whether they're one-time or continuous run rates, what we do is, we always look at the portfolio of projects and opportunities that are going to bring value, and we invest in those. We build the business for the long haul. Don't think about the quarterly cycle as much as we do, is making the right level of investments, and we have -- that's how we've arrived at the number, and the guidance number, at $625 million to $675 million in CapEx.","And the same approach is on R&D, which is not a lot of really good projects out there right now, that have great ROIs for our customers. And so we're looking at those and always evaluating whether they should be done and whether you can bring the right value and the portfolio we have is, it's a fantastic portfolio, both for factory improvements, and one of the ones we mentioned, is the Chillicothe new paint facility, which will improve efficiencies and quality, just as an example.","And as we look at the R&D spending kinds of projects on powertrains, and we mentioned electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles and more aerodynamic truck models, improvements, all of those are things that we look at and say, hey, if we can do this, and it's going to make our already best in class trucks even better, then we're going to do them.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then just lastly, I think last quarter you called out some customer mix headwinds. Obviously, we saw an improvement in margins this quarter, part of that was just stockings from the headwinds from last quarter. But were there any customer mix changes this quarter that we should be thinking about, kind of for the remainder of the year?","Preston Feight","So I think we already kind of talked about North America being a positive for us in the quarter. And I think that's really the only minor thing that was -- I would say it was a contributor. But overall, good pricing, good cost control and a stronger North American mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman","I wanted to start with a clarification of the fourth quarter production being down 6% to 8% sequentially. Could you break that out between your plans for North America and Europe?","Preston Feight","So I think they're fairly comparable without running exact numbers. They are both roughly in the same ranges in the quarterly, look at how they how they moved about high-single digits in North America, and it was a series of smaller steps through Europe, that did the same thing.","Adam Uhlman","And then, I'm wondering what your view is on medium-duty truck markets next year in North America and then also your thoughts on Europe as well?","Preston Feight","So for the medium-duty market in North America, I think we're seeing, it's around 100,000 in North America and right around 50,000 in Europe for next year. So, comparable numbers for this year.","Adam Uhlman","And then just back to Europe. I'm wondering if you would be willing to share with us, the magnitude of the order declines that you did see in that region, and do you get the sense that order rates are bottoming out now, if we start to see a leveling out of that pace of decline, or is that maybe still too early?","Preston Feight","It what we're really trying to look at, is what's going on with the cycle and what's going on with the timing of the calendar year, and in fact of recent, we've seen an improving order intake in Europe, actually it's matching up to our build, so that's been a nice balancing point. And hopefully that will be what continues.","Adam Uhlman","Is there any particular region or part of the continent that saw a nice improvement?","Preston Feight","Got to believe it has something to do with providing great trucks to our customers, and I think that really is a big part of it at the end of the day, because I think that we've been able to get to our record market shares in Europe and hold on to that share because people are experiencing our fantastic trucks and want some more of those.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso","I was impressed with the parts outlook for next year. Can you give us a little more comfort on your visibility to project that kind of parts growth for next year? I know you have some help from the aging of the engines, hitting a sweet spot. But can you help us get a little more comfort with that stronger growth?","Preston Feight","Yes, sure. I think that strong growth is a result of, as you said the engines. It's also this investment in TRP that we're doing. Our team there does a fantastic job in e-commerce and in reaching out to our customers through new ways that are meeting their needs. So we're able to just kind of keep taking more and more of the market.","These investments in our PDCs that we mentioned, both in Ponta Grossa in Brazil and in Las Vegas, allow us to get parts to the customers more quickly in those regions, which makes us a more desirable provider. And really frankly in partnership with our dealerships, who are fully committed to growing their parts business, because it's good for them, good for our customers and good for us, it's one of those real opportunities for win-win-win.","David Raso","Are there any metrics of any kind though that you for backlog of some kind or some parts -- percent of the parts business that has some sort of annual contract?","Preston Feight","Yes. Parts don't really work out that kind of a long backlog, it's much more of a...","David Raso","I appreciate that. But just any anything you're looking at, that might give us some more comfort on the number?","Preston Feight","Well, I think the comfort should come from the historically strong performance and then the reasons that we just talked about, which are just a lot of great products, growing relation of PACCAR products in Europe and North America over the past several years and that has also contributed to that growth and will continue to contribute to that growth, and some strong markets that we have a large part of trucks out there.","David Raso","And last, the European business, the leasing of trucks, can you help us a little bit, well you said there was less of it in this quarter, sort of, what are you seeing on that front for the mix going into next year?","Preston Feight","Missed the first part of your question on this side, can you say it again David?","David Raso","For the European business, the mix of businesses where there are some buyback guarantees and the leasing of the business, how you represent to the revenues, it impacted the price per unit delivery this quarter. Can you just help us take us through your thoughts on '20, on the mix for that into next year?","Preston Feight","I think it's probably going to run a lot like this '19 has gone. Those adjustments were more '19 to '18 than they were looking forward. So we're at a pretty stable rate of optional and fixed rate GRVs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Kauffman","A lot of my questions have been answered. I wanted to focus a little bit on tax rate, if that's okay. It looks like the tax rate outlook had come down a little bit, and maybe I'm not thinking about it right, I would have thought more North American exposure would have driven it higher? Am I wrong, does it drive it lower, and is that kind of a lower level of taxes that we should be thinking about for the rest of this year?","Harrie Schippers","The tax rate normally -- you should think about is a 23% level. We benefited in Q3 from higher R&D credits than originally anticipated. So those are our final returns.","Jeff Kauffman","So should I carry that through to the end of the year, or is it more of a third quarter thing?","Harrie Schippers","Well, I think you should think in terms of 23% for Q4 and for 2020.","David Raso","And as I look to -- okay. You said for 2020. That's my question, all my others have been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","In U.S. and Canada, it looks like Class 6, 7 growth was pretty healthy in the quarter, and better than the market, and so curious, whether that's just sort of time...","Preston Feight","Joe, are you still there?","Ken Hastings","Lindsay, are you there?","Operator","Yes, I am showing that Joe is still connected.","Preston Feight","Well, I guess, we'll just -- we aren't hearing from you, we will just kind of try to extrapolate your question a little bit.","Ken Hastings","Or we could move on and maybe Joe can rejoin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Neil Frohnapple","I believe PACCAR's market share historically tends to be counter-cyclical. I mean is there any reason to think that your market share wouldn't be higher in 2020, and your production wouldn't outperform the industry? I guess I'm just asking the production question a little differently.","Preston Feight","Sure. I think, the trucks are performing exceptionally well in the field. I think our customers are experiencing that we're delivering the best fuel economy, and the lowest operating cost of any brand. So we do think that should drive our market share up, and looking forward to that happening, and working every day to make sure that does happen.","Neil Frohnapple","And then just going back to the parts sales growth outlook for next year, 4% to 6%. I'm presuming that the lower outlook, I guess relative to the 8% part segment CAGR that you talked about at the Investor Day, is more due to just fleets pulling back on spending and purchasing obviously a lot less trucks next year. So I guess, at what point do you think that growth rate can start to reaccelerate, in order for you guys to hit those long-term targets?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think that the 4% to 6% number is a nice steady growth rate in a market that's declining, as depending on what happens. And again, I think that there's a lot of things working right to it, as far as when it come back up. We'll keep our eyes on that, and watching for every opportunity to grow it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Salmon with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Robert Salmon","Could you give a little clarification on the used truck outlook, it sounded like in the third quarter, it was down 10% to 15%, is that what you guys are contemplating looking out, or are you contemplating kind of a similar absolute level of used truck sales, from a price perspective?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think that down amount that we've seen, maybe that will continue. It's obviously difficult to forecast entirely where it will stay settled out to. But...","Harrie Schippers","It could stay around for the next couple of quarters.","Preston Feight","And I think you know the thing we're looking at is just that there is -- there is still a really healthy demand out there for day cabs specifically, and although values are down, we have the advantage of PACCAR of having a mix of trucks. We are not very uniform in our truck distribution. A lot of day cabs, a lot of pickup and delivery, a lot of vocational trucks, and some sleeper trucks as well.","So I think our ability to move those trucks should at least perform to the market and probably outperform, and again, we'll keep getting the premium for those trucks.","Robert Salmon","And as I look at the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter, can you give an update on what the price cost spread was in the third quarter? And then, looking out to the fourth quarter, if there are any sort of different assumptions you have built in there, just to get a sense of what sort of decrementals you guys are kind of thinking about in production, versus a different price cost mix?","Preston Feight","And so, in the third quarter, we saw a price of roughly 3% and cost of 1.5%. And I think in the fourth quarter, I think there will be more pricing pressure, but there could be some opportunity on costs, that we're evaluating right now.","Robert Salmon","And would you expect the cost opportunity to kind of continue, should it step up in 2020, relative to your experience in the fourth quarter? Or are you kind of thinking about something similar?","Preston Feight","I think it might be hard to guess out to what is going to be in 2020 right now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shawn Kim with Gabelli Funds. Your line is now open.","Shawn Kim","Just wanted to follow up on the parts business. I think at your Investor Day, you mentioned -- you guys expect to have 450,000 MX engines in service by 2024. But I guess, said another way, I mean is that the right way to look about your total addressable market for the parts business in the mid 2020s? So if -- I think the active U.S. Class 8 population is about 2.2 million trucks. I guess, out of that 2.2 million figure, what's the opportunity for you guys long-term regarding servicing those trucks on the road?","Preston Feight","So I think about it in a couple of different ways. One is, that you mentioned is, the growing MX park that's out there, we did add capacity to our Columbus engine plant, and increase our build rates of MX engines. In fact, in the second -- in the first half, I think we were 39% MX, and in the third quarter we were 45%, so we saw some growth there and do see some continued upside for MX engines, as people get to realize the benefits of that great engine.","And then I think it's not just about our park of vehicles for Kenworth and Peterbilt and DAF for the engine. I think our team does a great job of also capturing into the all-mix business with the TRP brands, where 50% of those customers are new to PACCAR, which creates a great opportunity for growth for us as well.","And I think we're always looking at opportunities to grow, not just the parts business itself, but provide increased levels of service for our customers, and that comes through higher degrees of connectivity of the trucks, where we understand better what's going on. So all of those point to opportunities to keep growing the parts business over time.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ken Hastings","Yes. We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2017. PACCAR's first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.2 billion, and first quarter net income was $310 million, a 7.3% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly pre-tax profits of $152 million. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.1%, helped by the strong European truck market and growth in PACCAR Part sales. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees. We have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR delivered 35,000 trucks during the first quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth raised build rates during the quarter in response to robust order intake. Looking ahead, we expect a 10% increase in deliveries in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to higher build rates in North America and Australia.","Second quarter gross margins are projected to be slightly higher than first quarter margins, reflecting the operational benefits of higher build rates. PACCAR's forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market has been increased to a range of 270,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand and the steady economic outlook.","Europe's GDP growth expectations for this year are 1.6% in the UK and on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways in the first quarter was at record levels and up 3% compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date, DAF has achieved a 15.7% share of European heavy truck market registrations. The economic picture in the U.S. is also positive with GDP forecast to grow 2.2% this year.","Housing starts are projected to grow 9% to 1.3 million units and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 17.3 million vehicles. Industrial production is estimated to grow 1.7% this year due to stronger manufacturing and mining output. This will be the first year of industrial production expansion since 2014.","We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 190,000 to 220,000 units this year. The economy's steady growth is supportive of healthy freight levels. The ATA Tonnage Index continues at high levels. Peterbilt and Kenworth's share of industry Class 8 orders so far this year is strong at 32% as customers appreciate the benefits of Kenworth and Peterbilt's reliable and fuel-efficient trucks and industry-leading resale values.","PACCAR Parts quarterly pre-tax income was a record $152 million, 13% higher than a year ago. Pre-tax return on revenue was an excellent 19.3%. PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $787 million, 9% higher than in the same quarter of last year. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. PACCAR's dealers worldwide have invested over $1 billion over the last five years to open 200 new dealer locations in North America and Europe.","PACCAR's new truck models and expanded powertrain have created a tremendous business opportunity for PACCAR and our dealers. These dealer network investments support PACCAR's continued growth in truck market share and aftermarket sales. PACCAR Financial Services first quarter pre-tax income was $57 million, compared to $80 million earned a year ago. Excellent portfolio performance was partly offset by the effects of the industry's lower used truck values in the U.S. and Canada.","PACCAR Financial continued to invest in the remarketing of PACCAR trucks by opening its third truck remarketing center near Chicago. These truck centers further enhance Kenworth and Peterbilt residual values which command a 10% to 20% premium over competitors' trucks.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $3 billion in new products and facilities in the last five years. This year, capital expenditures of $375 million to $425 million and research and development expenses of $250 million to $280 million are targeted for truck and powertrain product development, enhanced manufacturing and parts distribution facilities, and aftermarket support programs.","PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by delivering the highest quality products and services in the industry.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Can you talk about which regions drove the acceleration in the part sales in this quarter, how broad-based is it, and it sounds like the inventory destock that we saw parts of last year has played out already. To what extent is that a contributing factor?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say that the greater share of the increase comes from North America, but we also saw growth in our Europe business as well.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And can you say more about the used truck headwind in the quarter, was that mark-to-market on outstanding lease residual values, can you just flesh that out for us in terms of is there a risk of additional charges on the outstanding lease book?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, that primary relates to trucks that we sell, the good news is there was better demand for trucks. Unfortunately the prices are dampened because of the high quantities of used trucks that are in inventories, we're seeing from several of our competitors and that's dampening the prices. And so, I don't \u2013 we've not seen any further deterioration in prices, but we haven't seen an increase either.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And what about the operating leases that you folks have outstanding, can you remind us when do you do the impairment test on whether the market value is below the residual value that's recorded for FinCo.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. We review those every quarter, Jerry. And we mark those to, and we adjust the residual values and depreciation accordingly.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And there was no adjustment related to the operating lease for this quarter at all?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I don't \u2013 I think there was probably a small amount that was included in the first quarter results.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of George (9:00) of Wells Fargo.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, good morning. Could you provide us a little bit more color of what you're seeing in regional truck trends and in South America, first outside of Brazil and then inside of Brazil? I know, (9:15) commented that it thought that it was seeing a bottom, I'm wondering if you agree?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, the \u2013 I think the South American market will be comparable this year to what we saw last year. So, we would hope that as Brazil sells some of its economic challenges that we'll see return to growth in that business and a lot of the \u2013 the rest of the South America will be dependent on how the mining and commodities develop, so I think there is some positive trends in that arena.","Unknown Speaker","Sounds great. I know you commented on improved strength in the North American Canadian market, are you \u2013 that you didn't move your forecast at all, are you expecting the strength to kind of maintain itself throughout the year or you feel like it will subside in anyway?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think when we had discussion in January, our market range was probably above the average of other estimators and as time has gone on, they have increased their market size estimates to be closer to ours. So, we feel pretty comfortable with our range and if orders continue at the pace, we could be at the mid to upper portion of the range.","Unknown Speaker","That sounds great. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is Kristy (11:04) on for Ann Duignan. Can you guys describe the environment by end market in North America, and where you're seeing orders coming from? Is it, say, oil and gas over the long-haul? And can you describe by region in the EU and how sustainably you think current orders rates are into the second half of 2017?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I'd say we're seeing good broad-based order intake across all segments, the vocational segment has been steady for several years now, and we're seeing good order intake from the long-haul side in Europe. The Western Europe continues to be strong, Central Europe as well, and we're seeing some recovery and order intake from the Russian market as we begin this year.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi this is Emily McLaughlin on for Seth. I'm just wondering, do you think that the 32% you reported for the Class 8 order share is sustainable, and is there anything you can point to specifically than if you'd be driving the share gains?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Our Kenworth and Peterbilt's retail sales share in the second half of last year was roughly 30%, 31%. And so I think that order intake share is in line with that, the retail sale share in the first quarter was 28.2%. And so, we hope to see that continue at that level or increase as we progress through the year.","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And then, one more. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any notable change in order mix in terms of smaller owner operator versus larger fleets for their Class 8 segment?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, I think it's pretty consistent with what we've been seeing now for the last year or so.","Emily McLaughlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. That's all I had.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Great. Thein, this is Tim. Yeah, good morning, Ron. How you're doing.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Tim.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Good, good. Hey, just coming back to the first question on the financial services. I'm trying to kind of get a better understanding in terms of the increase that call at $35 million increase in net interest and other line year-over-year. How much of that with is, I guess I'm getting out, was this a kind of more one-time impairment or is this \u2013 will there be an ongoing impact from higher depreciation or combination of both? Maybe just a little bit more clarity on that would be helpful?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. So, one of the things that's caused \u2013 impacting revenues and interest in other is the fact that the mix of our portfolio is a little bit more tilted towards operating leases, which have higher revenue and expense per truck associated with them. And then we did have on some bulk sales of used trucks in the first quarter. That's where we saw the losses that we incurred on some of those sales. And so we'll see how pricing develops, but, as I can say, demand has increased and we'll monitor prices very closely to see if we can get some better price realization as we go forward.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Okay, okay. And are you able to \u2013 I mean, at this point, maybe provide some more color in terms of the amount of lease returns in your North American financing business in the quarter, do you have that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. That will be in our 10-Q when we publish that.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Yeah?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Okay, okay. And then, I guess, maybe just a last one on Parts, obviously off to a strong start in 1Q, are you still expecting to be in that kind of plus 2% to 4% range or is it \u2013 has the thought process changed in terms of full-year revenue for Parts?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think, based on the first quarter results, probably 3% to 5% would be our estimate of how we would see the year progress for Parts.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Okay, okay. Understood. And just close it up on gross margin expectations, obviously, above the midpoint here in 1Q with \u2013 and you're talking about deliveries going up, are we still thinking it kind of mid-14% range at the higher end or for the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think in the 14% to 14.5% range for the year would be the way to think about the rest of the year for us.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Investment Research","Got it. Understood. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Ross.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry to harp on the FinCo questions, but just I guess to expand on what Tim was asking, I mean in a flattish used truck pricing environment is that $57 million in FinCo pre-tax earnings kind of the inappropriate run rate or should this kind of bounce back to more in line with year ago levels?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think once we get through the used truck, I think we'll see recovery, assume all other things being equal, assuming similar interest rate environment, et cetera.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So in order to see sort of a step up, you've actually got to see a change in earnings for the FinCo. You've got to see a change in market conditions, from the sounds of it.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's fair and as we continue to work with our used truck inventories, and we'll see hopefully that progress as we go through the rest of this year in a positive way.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks. And then, maybe you could talk just about the truck margin itself as the parts margin was very strong, the truck margin was a little bit soft. Could you help us maybe bridge the year-on-year, and maybe just include some comments on sort of pricing and raw material costs?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, when you look at the incremental margin from the fourth quarter, incremental margin was 18%, which is basically in line with how we would think about how incremental margins would move quarter-to-quarter in the 15% to 20% range. So, right in line with how we anticipated it would develop.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And in terms of pricing versus raw material costs, was there anything notable from the UK or with all the currency movements or anything like that which you would highlight?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","The pound euro exchange rate continues to be \u2013 I guess, I would call it a bit of a headwind, but we're working through that as time goes on. And the U.S. and Canadian market, as we progressed through last year, the orders and the retail sales decline. And so we ended last year in a more competitive position and we're still in that same situation as we began the year this year.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Sorry to do this one, quick one on used price dynamics. Any impact from mix of what was sold in the quarter? You're seeing, I would say, much more pressure on the sleepers in the market, less so on the day cabs, did that factor in to what you saw?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think it's pretty, pretty evenly across the market. I don't think there is any particular impact with sleepers versus day cabs.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And used prices being weak isn't really a new issue for the industry. So, I guess I'm struggling a bit with why this is really the first quarter PACCAR has had an issue. Just any idea why it's popping up for you where your peers have been dealing with it for a while now?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think it's just because of the volume of used trucks. We did have increased used truck sales in the quarter. And so higher trucks, higher used truck sales is the reason it's, I guess, it's slightly bigger impact than it has been.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. Shifting to the new market, so you've obviously gained a lot of share at the trough of this recent correction. It looks like we have an upcycle on the horizon, looks like with that upcycle in play, Q1 market share in terms of the order book is normalizing a little bit. Can you maybe help us frame, I don't know a peak-to-peak market share is the right way to look at it, but what's sort of market share PACCAR would expect as we may be an inch back closer to 300,000 unit markets?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","That's \u2013 our guys are working hard to \u2013 like our customers, the best trucks and satisfy their needs and we have great products, we have great support services and we think that over time, that will lead to share improvement as it has for the last 20 years. So, being able to predict how that's going to progress quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year is a bit challenging.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Maybe on Q1 itself, so the whole 32% and I think we can call Q1 a recovery corridor in order intake, is holding 32% doable, because that obviously would represent market share relative to where you have been?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","It's just dependent on how things develop. There's no \u2013 we would hope that that 32% continues, but we have competitors in the market and everybody works hard to keep their business moving forward. So, we'll see how it develops as we progress through the year.","Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning, it's Cleve Rueckert on for Steve.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Just a follow-up on the Q1 orders strength. Do you guys have a color on how that developed from a customer perspective, I mean how much was energy versus construction versus over the road? Is there any shift going on there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Probably, the \u2013 the biggest increase was probably the over the road. Like I said, vocational has been pretty steady. We did see some improvement in vocational. But as a percent of total, the increase in orders, I think, comes a lot from the on highway customers. And we are seeing some, some recovery in the energy segment, but it's pretty early days for that.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful, thanks. And then just a quick one, can you reconcile the lower European revenues with the higher volumes, say, on a year-over-year basis, what's driving that small divergence there?","Unknown Speaker","There is a couple of factors on that one. One, as we have \u2013 when we do residual value, it guarantees in Europe, we account for those as operating leases, so we differ the revenues. So there is a truck delivery, but the revenue gets deferred and amortized over time and we had a higher number of those operating lease activities in Europe during the quarter, compared to last quarter. So that accounted for about $40 million or so of the difference, plus the pound and the euro were both lower against the U.S. dollar compared to last year.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it's nothing to do with pricing there.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No.","Unknown Speaker","No, actually pricing was up a bit as some prices were increased to reflect the effective pound versus the euro in UK.","Cleve Rueckert - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's it from me. Thanks very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joel Tiss of Bank of Montreal.","John Joyner - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. This is John Joyner in for Joel.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","John Joyner - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","So, I guess you're getting \u2013 good morning. A lot of B teams today. So, just real quick on FinCo again and I know this amount is, absolutely dollar amount is not big, but when you look at the provision for losses, I wonder that I guess nearly double from a year ago?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I mean the provision for loss is at historically low levels. I think last year, if you look at the elements of the change in the reserve, the level of credit losses is very similar. This year, we had an increase in the provision. Last year, we had a decrease in the provision. And that just reflects movements in portfolios in the various geographies, and as you said, it's a relatively small impact. And so, if the portfolio continues to perform very well, past dues had been at below 1% for almost four or five years now. So, it's purely just small numbers.","John Joyner - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. And just maybe one more, I mean, can you talk a little bit about your products? I know over the past couple of years, you and another of your competitors have been rolling out new products and kind of a refresh of the portfolio, and can you maybe talk about any traction that's being gained or where you see strong customer uptake versus your competitors, because kind of all you hear is that, oh, every product is gaining share and obviously that can't necessarily be the case?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we have great product, and we've launched the 2.1 meter products here in North America, that percentage of build has continued to increase. And currently, we're at about 75% of Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy duty truck build or the newer models, very well received, performing excellently, we launched and we included the update to the 2017 MX engine in those trucks at the beginning of this year, adding another 3% to 4% of fuel efficiency.","So, the trucks are performing great and very well received by the customers. And just this morning, our DAF team launched their newest XF model at the Birmingham truck show, which basically incorporates all the engine enhancements that we adopted here in North America into the DAF product as well as some additional chassis and cab changes that improved aerodynamics and fuel efficiency up to about a 7% improvement.","So, we just continue to move the needle forward on our products, and customers really appreciate the lowest total cost of ownership. When you combine the low operating costs with the strong residual values it makes for a good value proposition for our customers.","John Joyner - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Baudendistel from Stifel.","Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thank you. Thank you. Just wanted to ask you on the Parts segment, I think you said you have 17 existing parts distribution facilities and you're opening a couple more that are 100,000 or 170,000. Can you just frame that for us as what percentage increase in parts distribution capacity that represents?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, I think we roughly have about $2.2 million of square feet in parts distribution center space around the world. So, we're going to increase the \u2013 we increased the distribution capacity here in Washington at our Renton facility by about 80,000 square feet, and we're going to increase the distribution capacity in Toronto by another 100,000 square feet when we finish construction of that next year. So, as we look forward, our parts team has really clear view of continuing to increment that capacity as the parts business grows. And so, that kind of pace per year, I think you'll see going forward.","Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And your forecast for growth in Parts of 3% to 5% this year, if you view that as a normalized rate or somewhat of a muted rate, given the environment that you think will accelerate back to the prior growth rate of 7% or 8%.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think that's what we're expecting at this point, whether that's \u2013 just how we see the development of the market for us globally.","Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And also just want to ask you on one of the topics of the hour. There was a lot of media attention given to a certain tweet about from a certain company that does electric vehicles that they're planning to have a prototype out of a semi-electric semi-truck this fall. And wanted to ask you since you occupy sort of the premium end of the marketplace on Class 8 trucks. Do you view an electric truck as a credible threat longer-term if we were to think out 10 years?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, longer-term, 10 years, I think that's the kind of timeframe and we're working on electric trucks, hybrid electric, hydrogen fuel-cell, natural gas. I mean, we're investing in all alternative fuel strategies to be prepared for what may come. So, nobody is standing still and everybody's \u2013 I can't say everybody I guess. We're certainly focused on being prepared for market dynamics and market transitions as they occur.","Michael J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sounds great. Thanks very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Barry Haimes of Sage Asset.","Barry George Haimes - Sage Asset Management LP","Thanks very much. Yeah, I have one follow-up on the financial services. So, if you're marketing used trucks to market every quarter and if used truck prices stayed flat sequentially, why wouldn't the financial services profit move up sequentially as well, as opposed to it seemed like you indicated that it would be sort of a gradual improvement as we went through the year. But why wouldn't you see that improvement sequentially right away?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","In the accounting rules the mark-to-market is based on a one-truck transaction and we sell used trucks and typically multiples of that, and so a larger sale typically has some discounting pricing that goes with that.","Barry George Haimes - Sage Asset Management LP","Okay. Thanks. And then one question on another topic. The Class 8 orders, I think by most accounts have come in better than folks expected over the last several months, and in spite of the fact that truckload rates has been pretty soft. So, I'm wondering if you have any thoughts as to why you think the orders have been better. Is it that the few economy gap is so large or are there some other factors that might account for the better tone and in spite of the fact that truckload profitability isn't so great? Thanks so much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Net truck load profitability, I mean, it's down from maybe the peak, but it's still pretty good. And we see that in our finance portfolio, customers have no problem servicing their truck payments. So I think there is \u2013 as is in any year, we're starting to see the age of the fleet creep-up a bit. And so there are just more customers who are probably getting to the point where it makes sense to take advantage of the additional investment to fuel efficiency that comes with the latest versions of heavy-duty trucks.","Barry George Haimes - Sage Asset Management LP","Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Jaffray.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask another maybe a longer term thematic strategic question. This time regarding self-driving vehicles, obviously it's another area of intense media interest recently, just wondering if you could give an update on what your strategy is there, if it's changed at all over the last 6 months to 12 months. And I don't know, if you would consider acquisitions, partnerships, organic development. Just any color you can provide will be helpful?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","One of the things that we've done and we've seen over the last 12 months, really 24 months is the software controls that are in our vehicles are becoming ever more important and we've increased our engineering resources, particularly in the software area. And so, I think we'll continue to see that as we progress over the coming years and with some of those resources dedicated to developing autonomous vehicle technologies. There is a lot of things that have to happen for autonomous trucks to become a reality, but we've had platooning demonstrations, we've had autonomous truck demonstrations. So, we're involved and engaged in that in a big way and we'll continue to make investments in that arena as we go through this year and for the next five years, 10 years.","So, we're working closely with a lot of different parties in the industry and so we'll continue to develop our capability.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, great. And then one last question, you had mentioned earlier, the impact of the pound moving around and the OEMs having to increase pricing in the UK in order to make up for that. Just wondering, if you've seen any pushback or if the market seems capable of absorbing that increase in pricing?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I'd say it's a gradual process, it just takes time and we've been \u2013 we've done this before and it just takes a while for it to work its way through the system.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay.

Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning. I first want to thank the investors and analysts who participated in our investor conference in Eindhoven in May, the DAF employees and the PACCAR team were proud to share DAF's world-class facilities and innovative products and services. PACCAR's pleased to report outstanding financial results for the second quarter of 2018. PACCAR achieved record quarterly sales and Financial Services revenues of 5.81 billion and strong net income of $560 million a 9.6 after-tax return on revenue. Revenues were 23% higher and net income was 50% higher compared to the second quarter last year.","PACCAR Parts generated record revenues and record pretax profits of $195 million, its sixth consecutive record profit quarter. PACCAR achieved excellent truck parts and other gross margins of 15%, driven by industry leading products and services, robust global truck and aftermarket parts demand and strong operational performance.","I am extremely proud of our 27,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR delivered a record 46,400 trucks during the second quarter 5% more than the first quarter this year. U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry truck orders and finals -- in the first six months of 2018 were more than double the orders in the first half of last year.","DAF achieved record market share of 16.5% year to date this year. DAF's above 16 ton orders were 26% higher in the first half of 2018 compared to the same period last year. PACCAR's forecast for the European above 16 ton market is a range of 300,000 to 320,000 units reflecting strong freight and truck demand and a good economic outlook. We expect to deliver slightly more trucks in the third quarter this year compared to the second quarter. Deliveries will be higher in North America, partially offset by fewer bill days in Europe due to the normal summer shutdown.","Second-half gross margins for truck parts and other will be similar to the first half. The U.S. economy's growth is driving record freight tonnage. Customers are operating at high utilization levels and are expanding their fleets. We estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales to be in a range of 265,000 to 285,000 vehicles this year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income of 195 million was 29% higher than a year ago. Pretax return on revenue was an excellent 20.1%.","PACCAR Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $968 million, 18% higher than in the same quarter of last year. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. PACCAR\u2019s investment in distribution centers and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. For the year, we expect parts sales to increase by 13% to 15%.","PACCAR Financial Services, second quarter pre-tax income was $72 million, 16% higher than second quarter last year. The PACCAR financial portfolio performed very well. Used truck industry demand in the U.S. has increased, boosting used truck prices by 5% to 10% compared to last year. PACCAR strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest $3 billion in new products and facilities in the last five years.","This year, capital expenditures of $425 million to $475 million and research and development expenses of $300 million to $320 million are targeted for new truck models, integrated powertrains including electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies and new product technologies for advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity.","At our investor event in May, we were pleased to have the DAF CF Electric and Hybrid trucks available for the attendees to drive. In May, PACCAR's Board of Directors increased PACCAR's regular quarterly dividend by 12% and $0.28 per share and earlier this month, authorized an additional 300 million share repurchase program. PACCAR is realizing the benefits of strong truck markets worldwide and is delivering the highest quality products and services in the industry.","Thank you. And I\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","So I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of Ron you talked a little bit about how used truck pricing is up 5% to 10%. Can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in new truck pricing? And then related to that, how far out now are you sort of quoting deliveries? I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how stretched out the backlog is, and how much impact that might be having on your ability to get some price?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, new truck pricing is up a bit and that seemed commodity costs move up a bit during the course of the year. And our pricing, our sales prices have moved up to offset that and earn a little bit of additional margin. And on the backlog, backlog is strong. We are taking fair number of orders for 2019 build at this point. So, the backlogs are really solid, really almost in all of our markets.","Steve Volkmann","And then I guess in Europe specifically, I think you said DAF orders up 26% in the first half and obviously the market growth rate is nowhere near that high in terms of your forecast. So, it looks like this maybe you and DAF really gains quite a bit of market share. Or do you think there's some reason that DAF's order rates may fade in the second half?","Ron Armstrong","We're at 16.5% year-to-date, and Harrie what was the number for last year for DAF?","Harrie Schippers","15.3.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, 15.3. So, almost a share point gain based on first half results. So, DAF had great product introductions in the second half of last year with the new CF, XF and LF -- CF XF won international truck of the year. The feedback in the trade press and from customers has just been outstanding. And so, that's well recognized and that is really that what's driving DAF's excellent performance for the six months this year.","Steve Volkmann","And then just the quick follow-up and I'll let it go is that obviously the markets are concerned about things peaking and sometimes I guess good is bad or something like that. But I'm just curious if you have any opinion as to sort of what the lengths of this cycle might look like? And where do you feel like current conditions are sort of peaky and kind of as good as it gets?","Ron Armstrong","So, I think as we mentioned in our press release, we feel very good about 2019 based on the demand that's in there for our excellent products. Parts business is great. Financial Services has got great new business volume. So, we see no signs of abatement in terms of second half and heading into 2019.","Harrie Schippers","And Steve, I would like to add that if you look at the current market dynamics little bit the amount is driven by strong freight, strong economy, excellent fuel economy, and some of the prior cycles in 2007, 2010 and 2013, the demand was driven by prebuys our emission legislation and that's different today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Just on the deliveries in the quarter were up by it's been about 5% versus I think the original guidance is 7% to 9%. To what extent was that due to supplier constraints? Or was it something else than maybe you just broadly talk about the supplier picture at the moment?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, as I mentioned previously that, as we go up and build rates, it requires really close coordination with all of our suppliers, and as we work through the details of that was -- that was what was able to be delivered. And so, teams are purchasing supplier quality, materials plant guys did a great job of working with our suppliers. And as we mentioned, we will continue to see some upward momentum and build particularly in North America in the third quarter, as we continue to work with our suppliers to support the demand for our customers.","Steven Fisher","Do you think the supply chain constraints are materially eased at this point or relatively balanced and able to meet the production requirements for the industry needs or is it\u2026","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I would say it's balanced, yes.","Steven Fisher","And then maybe just shifting gears a little bit, if you can talk about what you are seeing in the oil market today? How much of your revenues are oil related overall? And maybe how much you are getting help from actually transporting of oil versus truck dated in the production process?","Ron Armstrong","The oil segment really accounts for a small percentage of our total business. Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF all have great products to support the industry, and we're seeing some benefits in that arena. But it's really we're seeing benefits in all areas, so oil is just not a significant piece of the total pie.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Just want to go back to on production, as you said, your DAF orders are up 26% in the first half of the year, your European deliveries were up like 12%, rest of the world up 15%. So clearly production has lagged thus far. The message coming out of the Investor Day seemed to be that capacity is a non-issue for DAF. I mean have you rethought that at all or what why the actual lag on production versus orders?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I mean if you look at North America, orders are double. And retail sales and production are nowhere near the order intake take rates. And so, the customers' order intake usually is more lumpy than production and retail sales, so it's just balancing longer-term production rates with order intake rates over period of time. So I wouldn't read anything that, but the factory has plenty of capacity in Europe as well. We work closely with our suppliers to support our ability to deliver timely to our customers based on their delivery expectations.","Ross Gilardi","If you look at the ACT data over the course of the second quarter, for the overall market, there seemed to be a production hiccup in May that that sort of bounced back in June. Did you experience any of that production slowdown or have any issues with production in the U.S. in throughout the second quarter?","Ron Armstrong","No, it's pretty normal for this time of the cycle.","Ross Gilardi","And then just with respect to the Class 8 orders, I mean of course they remain off the charts good. I mean, do you think there's any double or triple ordering going on to enable fleets to get in front of production queue? And do you have any policies in place on down payments or otherwise to prevent double ordering, any reason to think that that's going on?","Ron Armstrong","We have long-term relationships with a lot of our customers and I have no idea what they're doing with other makes, but we feel good about the backlog and we're set at this point with good quality long-term customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","When we were sitting here a quarter ago, you said a couple of things about gross margins going forward. One, you've said that your mix of truck deliveries would be more levered to fleets and therefore that would weigh on margins. And then I think you had expected parts to slow down and also mixed to weigh on margins. So, can you just update us on both of those? And what you did see in the quarter? Should we just take away from the strong gross margin that volume is a wonderful thing?","Ron Armstrong","Clearly, we saw the benefits of operating volumes in the quarter. Parts margins were 27.9 in the first quarter, 27.5 in the second quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, we think that the margins for the second half will be comparable to the excellent first half margin, so that 14.5% to 15% range.","Ann Duignan","So, 14.5 to 15 now, so no fleet mix issues or no nothing. What about FX? Is FX likely to weigh on margins either at the gross level or at the EBIT level in the second half?","Ron Armstrong","So, what we saw on exchange rate is that the benefit of exchange rate added to the margin dollars, but it didn\u2019t affect the margin percentage.","Ann Duignan","That will be a less of a tailwind, if currency stays where that's today?","Ron Armstrong","It was not a factor in terms of margin percentage now.","Ann Duignan","And then just following up on, one of the things we've heard and we have said, truck showing Hanover that's year once every three years of delay. My understanding is that almost every OEM will have an electric truck on the display. Will that be exhibiting electric vehicle to that show? And what could you tell us about what should expect to see by your competitors at this IAA?","Ron Armstrong","I can't comment on what the competitors. You have obviously seen ours. You have written in ours. So, you have had a chance to take it around the test track, so yes, we will have -- we will display those at the Hanover show.","Ann Duignan","Yes, and remember mine was a manual drive too. It didn't make it easy for me.","Ron Armstrong","You did a great job.","Ann Duignan","And just a quick follow-up on the 26% order increase for DAF versus 41% in Q1, what does that mean Q2 orders where year-over-year? And then given the registrations are only any up about 4%, I\u2019m going to assume that these are dealer orders in anticipation of sales picking up. Is that the right interpretation and I\u2019ll leave it there?","Ron Armstrong","The orders are typically driven by customer orders and so, that's we obviously sell some stock trucks, but the vast majority of our orders are driven by customer demand. So, no exception with DAF, Harrie, do you have the second quarter?","Harrie Schippers","Second quarter was up 10% compared to the second quarter last year. Last year, we had a strong second quarter too.","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Potter","I guess one maybe two questions on Europe. First of all, I was interested if you could comment on any mix trends that you're seeing obviously not all trucks have created equal, so if its medium duty trucks or its heavy duty trucks or Eastern Europe versus Western Europe. Anything that we should know about in terms of what that volume might be for the margin profile of what you are delivering?","Ron Armstrong","So, I\u2019d say the share enhancement that is occurred has really been driven by the tractor side DAF. For the first half of this year, it was the -- had a number one tractor in the market in Europe. So, again the CF, XF, the fuel efficiency gains are 7% or so. On average, fuel efficiency gain is really well appreciated by the on highway long-haul customer. So, we did see a bit of a increase in that particular area.","Alex Potter","That should be margin accretive, if I\u2019m reading that correctly. Is that right or\u2026","Ron Armstrong","Yes, the margins are all up pretty, pretty representative when you talk about the heavy side.","Alex Potter","And then I guess also on Europe. Just if you could maybe take a step back, I know this historically it's not been maybe as violently cyclical as the U.S. If you could just maybe update us on your longer term maybe two, three or four years outlook for the European cycle, not a specific forecast or anything, just sort of the general feel?","Ron Armstrong","Just general feel, the economy has done -- it's been in growth mode for three or four, five years. And the central bank and others are managing inflation and growth quite prudently, and it's nothing that we see in our radar is going to change the economic outlook for Europe and for the near and mid-term.","Alex Potter","And then last one. Specifically on gross margin, you had mentioned there are some gross margin numbers for parts in particular. It sounds like the parts segments has been doing quite well or at least no major downside from a gross margin standpoint, which I was a little bit surprised about. It seems like\u2026","Ron Armstrong","I would go with quite well.","Alex Potter","Yes, that's what it looks like. Well, it seems maybe I'm reading it incorrectly, but it's from sort of listening to comments from out of the cost and supply chain. It seems like a lot of the pressure to the extent that pressure exist from supply chain bottlenecks or steel, aluminum or things like that have been borne primarily by part as people prefer to prioritize ordering or delivering the OEM oriented parts instead of the aftermarket. But apparently, you didn't see any of that, so just any comments on that topic would be insightful?","Ron Armstrong","No, I think as we look obviously you got to keep the factory running, and so that, that is job one. But the suppliers have done a great job supporting our total business both factories and the aftermarket products business. So, at this point, we're in good shape from a supply support standpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering, if you can talk about your expectations of gross margin cadence 4Q versus 3Q? Over the past three years, we've seen 4Q have wider gross margins than 3Q either because of timing of parts deliveries ore rebates. And I just wanted to see, if we can just get more granular comments from you folks. And you mentioned back half, margins look like first half. What does that mean? 3Q higher than that and 4Q lower than that. Can you just give us some more contexts on margins seasonality this year?","Ron Armstrong","They'll be in the range that we talked about.","Jerry Revich","For both 3Q and 4Q?","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Jerry Revich","And then, as you folks assess the impact on the supply base of the tariffs that were put in place on July 6th. Can you just talk about what's your rough sense and whether any of your suppliers could be impacted by tariffs? Do you have an early read on how that looks for your supply base?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think the early reed is that there is not going to be a significant impact to our business and our expectations for operations based on what we know now. As you know, things can change quickly in that arena.","Jerry Revich","And lastly, can you just update us on the productivity that you folks are seeing as you ramp up the production significantly in the U.S.? What kind of productivity are you seeing from the labor force and the next round of production increases? Can you just give us a flavor for how much of that will be overtime versus new shifts?","Ron Armstrong","Most of it is just adding to the first or second shift mostly the second shift operation to support our demands in our factories.","Jerry Revich","And the productivity that you are seeing as you are adding so that shift, how does that complete?","Ron Armstrong","It's consistent with what we typically would see. I mean you are leveraging that fixed cost structure and the supervisory structure and management structure of the facilities, as you go up for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","I wonder, can you give us a little bit of an update on Brazil and maybe just talk generally about any other geographic markets that you're looking at that that might turn out to be interesting.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, Brazil, the team as we talked about before has done a great job of having a great product for the market. It's very well received by our customers. We're going to continue to increment production. For the year, we'll probably deliver about twice as many trucks this year as we did last year, which will yield some further share growth I think through mid month roughly at about a 6% share of the above 40 ton market in Brazil. So, team is doing great, you're being able to leverage the fixed costs, and so we'll continue to develop that business. The dealers are doing well and so long-term prospects for Brazil continue to be excellent.","You know as you look at other parts of the world Mexico we continue to generate the highest share in our company at 35% or so sure of the heavy market in Mexico. Australia the economy is good, truck demand is good, building trucks at a strong rate in Australia and demand for products outside of our primary markets in places like Russia, Turkey is good, so things are good around the around the world as we sit here today.","Joel Tiss","And just a couple of like nit-picky, can you talk a little about the $300 million going forward of share purchases? Is that aimed at just soaking up options? Or do -- you aim to take the share count down a little bit? And your inventories and receivables are up about 36%, which is well above your revenues, and I just wondered is there a strategy there to have a little extra parts inventory? Or is there something else going on?","Ron Armstrong","So, the share repurchase I mean as you know from time to time we'll buy back shares at the current bargain price. It's quite a deal, so we should be -- should be active in the market. And thinking about the receivables and inventory, as you may or may not recall, we typically close some of the factories down over the Christmas holiday period. And so, inventories and receivables at yearend are lower than they are relative to activity levels than if you could look at the other three quarters of the year. So, we're seeing some effect of that on both of those metrics.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Seth Weber","Just want to ask go back to supply-chain discussion for a second. Is PACCAR making any extra investments in its suppliers to sort of help them along here? Or is it just kind of business as usual?","Ron Armstrong","I would say it is pretty much business as usual, but we have had a long history of where suppliers can benefit us and them from if there's a win-win circumstance we are more than happy to make those investments and support suppliers to support PACCAR.","Seth Weber","Okay but nothing kind of unusual for DAF?","Ron Armstrong","Nothing of significance at this point.","Seth Weber","And then just follow-up just the strength in the parts business, you raised the outlook, the revenue outlook there. Can you just maybe just frame what areas, whether its engines or just regular business activity has been surprising to you or the source of the upside relative to your prior expectations?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I\u2019d say nothing surprising, but engine parts growth is higher than average because we are growing the part of PACCAR MX engines every day. We are putting 100% of PACCAR engines in DAF vehicles and they are building it at record production rates in Europe. We are putting 40% 45% MX engines in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks which are at high production rates. And the engine is now been in the field for eight years and so we're starting to see just the ongoing benefits of the engine parts sales.","Our teams have just done -- they put together some programs of supporting fleets the TRP stores the e-commerce initiatives all those things are yielding just great results and support for our customers. A big focus with their uptime initiatives to service our customers in the best way in the industry and that's recognized and keeps customers coming back to PACCAR parts on an ongoing basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","On the outlook just going back to the Seth's question from a different perspective. Parts up to 13% to 15% from prior 8% to 10%, at the midpoint, it implies a slight decline I mean slight like 1% in the second half for revenue from the first half, and that's coming after 10 consecutive quarters of sequential growth and then clearly, also moderation year-over-year to about 10 from 18 in the first half. Can you help us with the key factors when you are looking into the second half that might be causing you to expect the flapping out?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think that's the conservative guys at corporate not listening to the parts guys that what they are going to be able to do. So the parts team is obviously doing a great job, a lot of initiatives ongoing and so we are just -- appreciate that the trends have been and we expect -- we are just being a little bit conservative in terms of our outlook at this point.","Andy Casey","And then I'm just wondering what the currency shifts that have occurred maybe it's a little bit too early to see this. But has that impacted any export demand in any region? And if so, where you're seeing any sequential hesitation?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I'm just sort of search in my mind, I can't think of currency impacting demand. I think demand is there and currency is impact price realization and our cost from time-to-time, but again nothing significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","I guess first question just back to visibility that you guys stated into 2019. Can you just talk about how far your visibility stands relative to sitting here last year and was that comment specific just to North America or Europe as well? And then my second question, as we think about 2019, if you think about what some of the industry experts are forecasting. I mean, should we expect can incremental margins given where we are in this cycle improved from this level? Or should we expect them to temper just because the growth rate is probably won't be as robust?","Ron Armstrong","If you look at the orders, again, order backlogs are strong around the globe, and there is a quarter intake as the combination of current year and future year and while the fleets are reserving and spots for next year's build to make sure that get their trucks that they need, and so we are in great shape in that perspective. And from end margin standpoint we've sort of talk about what we expect for the second half and will see what's next year bring.","Jamie Cook","But is your visibility is greater as we sit here today versus last year?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think for sure.","Jamie Cook","And then you've just said before, normalized incremental margins are sort of 15% to 20%. Is that off the table going forward?","Ron Armstrong","Well that's what it's been for years up and down, so I think that's pretty good metric.","Operator","Your next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Just going back to Steve's question on pricing, I think you guys have mentioned in the past that you've been able to get a little bit better pricing in some of your smaller truck orders. So I'd just be curious in the backlog right now, has it been a lot of those big orders from our fleets? Or have they -- has a lot of the pricing been coming through still on those smaller orders? And to offset commodity cost and then also, are you getting any pricing on the Parts business? Or is that all volume?","Ron Armstrong","I think the pricing has been pretty normal in terms of the mix of customers that are in the build as well as in the backlog. So, I don\u2019t think there is any particular mix difference. And on the parts side, pricing is again the competitive margin and we can constantly monitor what's the competitive price that we need to achieve our goals and targets. And the team does a good job of managing that on our ongoing basis. I think just in the 10-Q analysis system we've seen some price realization in the parts business in the first half this year.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then just when we think about the used market, I -- you obviously talked about how the pricing has you know been up. And just curious, is there anything about the mix of these used markets right now? Is it younger than it's historically been? Are there more automated versus manual trucks in it? Or you know anything we should be thinking about kind of what the used markets look like today?","Ron Armstrong","I would say from our used truck perspective what you'll see is that, the trucks that are coming back starting now going forward are more of the latest developed trucks, the Euro 6 trucks, the model 2.1 meter trucks in North America which will have some benefit on the our used truck pricing as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Just as a straightforward question, I must've missed this. Price versus cost in the quarter just reported. Did it improve from what we saw in the first quarter? And the rest of the year does price versus cost, not just price and the price versus cost improve from here?","Ron Armstrong","So, I think it was the second quarter was similar to what we saw in the first quarter, and I think you know without -- I think it'll be similar in the second half of the year.","David Raso","And again, I might have missed this, the extension of the orders the visibility into '19. Can you quantify it a little bit? Or give a sense of what percent of the builds for say, first half of '19 are spoken for assuming all the orders stick?","Ron Armstrong","No, we've picked up, don't want to talk about that at this point.","David Raso","Alright, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Sameer Rathod","I think there's been some recent discussion about the current administration revoking Clean Air waivers in the state of California, any potential thoughts or any thoughts on the potential impact that could have on the truck market?","Ron Armstrong","It's so hypothetical, we don\u2019t really think about that. We know what the current law is. We know what it has been established for greenhouse gas phase 2 for 2021, 2024 and 2027. And we're managing our business to deal with what we know, And so, that's what we're focused on, if something were to change we'd deal with that at the time, but right now we're focused on the laws that exist.","Sameer Rathod","Okay thanks, I guess the next question is on labor. Are you having difficulty finding labor in any of your facilities, thank you?","Ron Armstrong","We have great facilities. We have a great place to work. We provide a great salary and benefits package for our employees and so we're fortunate that we're in communities that that's well-recognized and when we typically recruit people to support build rates we don't have any problem increasing our head count to support that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","When you talk about customers now ordering for 2019 and I think what you thought there these are some large fleets so trying to make sure that they get build slots. Typically, we think about model year at this point 2020 prices is not really being set and I think there's some speculation that some of those orders could be an attempt to get in front of more price increases. I guess, how do you address that? And how do you make sure that you take advantage of the opportunity to price in the strong demand environment and not give some of that away by just early orders?","Ron Armstrong","Well, again, for those transactions, there is typically multiple brands competing and you have to be competitive in the marketplace. So it's what the market will bear.","Joe O'Dea","I guess just so you are seeing that competitive dynamic ease at all and the backlogs have done what they done in lead times have extended and when you get those multi-brand competitions and the bids. Have you seen a little bit less price competition on those?","Ron Armstrong","I\u2019ll say it's very typical. It's very typical in normal circumstances.","Joe O'Dea","And then when we think about Europe and where you are sizing the over 16 ton market midpoint about 310,000, at 16.5% share that would be 51,000 units or so. It looks like you are on a delivery pace that would be slightly north of 60,000. Can you just talk about the medium duty, how big that is? And are some of these deliveries going to dealers who are trying to stock on the new trucks just given stronger demand levels there?","Ron Armstrong","We are selling -- we sell a lot of trucks outside of European market. So, Russia, Turkey, Africa, Middle East, South America, Australia, so those, the production from Eindhoven and Leyland is not just for the European market is for the globe.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, but I guess if UK is going down and you have got a strong share there. Where is it that you are seeing some of the share outperformance now?","Ron Armstrong","So, we are doing really well in central Europe, Eastern Europe, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary is where we've grown share significantly, but also markets like Germany France and Spain.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global. Your line is open.","Mike Shlisky","So I wanted to start with the R&D budget. The run rate so far this year in the first half is at the low end of your outlook for the full year. I was wondering, if you anticipate a ramp up in spending in the back half of the year. And can you just give us a sense of what you might be seeing as far as the R&D run rate in 2019 as well?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think look at second half the quarter is about to be $75 million to $80 million a quarter and next year I think the pace of spending will be similar to this year.","Mike Shlisky","And I also wanted to just get a quick detail on Brazil and how it's going there? Clearly, you have very well received miles over there. My question is, there was truckers strike during the second quarter here where there was some freight that was jammed up on the highway or it sort of didn't get on the road. Those are fleets are kind of continuing. I was wondering, if there was any impact to your business in the quarter? And could there some be some pent up demand post-election and late in '18 into 2019 once it all gets sorted out?","Ron Armstrong","The truckers strike affected the entire country in terms of shipments, and so yes, parts getting into the factory. There was a week or so where that was a challenge, but those trucks have been made up or being made us as we speak. The Brazilian economy have lots of potential and we're seeing growth this year absent to trucker strike, and the demand from customers is excellent and particularly for the dot product. And so we're optimistic as we mentioned we're going to be increasing our billed rates in the second half of the year. And we hope, if that continued to grow our business in the future.","Mike Shlisky","Just a quick follow-up on that as well. If now you have 4 or 5 during Brazil in any kind of way. Is this point where you start to see parts ramp up in that part of the world? Or is that more of your 6, 7, 8 story there?","Ron Armstrong","It's ramping up all the time. It's relatively low numbers relative to their -- our other markets because of the extensive trucks parts, but it's basically increased incrementing every month as more and more trucks get in the field, more and more of our dealers get connected with the all the transport companies and get the service into the shops. So it's an ongoing growth business as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neel Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Neel Frohnapple","Ron, can you talk about the used truck pricing outlook in North America for the second half of the year and into 2019? It sounds like industry demand remains very strong for used trucks, but do you think that's the biggest risk for their Class 8 market in your view given the increase in supply that could be hitting the market over the next few quarters?","Ron Armstrong","No, I don\u2019t feel that's a significant risk at all in fact it's there is good demand.","Harrie Schippers","And as lead times from new trucks go up, used trucks become more and more interesting alternatives.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, so late model used as, it's a very good market right now.","Neel Frohnapple","You don\u2019t anticipate by changing or increase is moderating at all from here?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think, it feels like it's going to be a good second half and a good start in first half for used trucks as we said here day, but that we will see how it develops.","Neel Frohnapple","And as a follow-up just to my earlier questions on the products business, I mean the sales growth for the products business continues to exceed expectations and I would certainly imagine that's outpace in the industry. And I understand you won't provide 2019 specific guidance. But, is there any reason I think of the business can continue to grow double digits in 2019 when considering the benefits like MX engine penetration and the expansion of TRP?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, we will see how that develops. I don\u2019t have further comment on at this point.","Neel Frohnapple","And one last one, how much the TRP increase on a year-over-year basis in the quarter?","Ron Armstrong","So if you look at TRP stores and the same stores sales stores that have been in existence for more than 12 months I think the comp is at 20%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.","Rob Wertheimer","So maybe as the tricky question to answer also, but it\u2019s also on parts and you guys have had such tremendous execution and success in growing that business very steadily. Are you able to comment on the cyclicality of that business? I mean, should we expect when the downturn comes that I don\u2019t know whether it's you are getting 5 or 10 points of growth from cyclicality or whether it's really all of your running initiatives. So I just don\u2019t know, if you have any way to measure market share gains you've had or upswing downswing in that business that you expect, if there is eventual downturn?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it is difficult to measure market share, but I think clearly our business has grown at a faster rate than the overall industry. And again, I attribute that to all the initiatives that are keen to -- I've put together, if you look over time obviously the volatility of parts is much less than the trucks. And it's the steady revenue and cash flow source day in day out.","Rob Wertheimer","No, it's been exceptional and then just a quick question just on the margin. I mean there was a time a few years back when oil prices fell and maybe you and some other parts businesses maybe pick up some margin partly cause of distribution costs falling, but at the end of the day your margins just keep going up and up. So I assume your competitiveness at these margin levels is as good as or better than ever. You don't even have any fears on that part.","Ron Armstrong","No, not at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Your line is open.","Mike Baudendistel","You saw the press release you're going to offer the PACCAR transmission with MX-11 engine. Can you just talk a little bit about the share that PACCAR has within its vertically integrated and transmissions? Where do you think that's going to go? And is that big enough to move the needle?","Ron Armstrong","I apologize, Mike, I don't have a current sort of assessment of the penetration rate of that transmission with the engine, but it's excellent. I just don't know what that is, so let me -- we'll come back to you on that.","Mike Baudendistel","Okay, no problem. And just wanted to ask you also, it seems like you have more sort of confidence in the electric market than you did maybe a couple of quarters ago when you said there really wasn't a lot of demand from customers. Can you just talk a little bit about sort of you know which -- where you're seeing that sort of extra demand versus a few quarters ago? What types of customers are demanding electric?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I don't think there's much more demand. You just had to be prepared as the regulatory environment may dictate some level of zero emission vehicles. So, we've been quite active in developing our capabilities and we'll continue to do so. The reality of the price of an electric vehicle is more than two times the cost of a diesel engine. You've got some range issues, weight issues. So, the economic viability of electric is not great. And so -- but you have to be prepared, so I don't think there's going to be a huge demand for electric for hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure and other things. A lot has to happen for that to be any sizable portion of the market the next five or 10 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","First, let's start with a clarification on the deliveries that are expected in the third quarter. How much of an improvement are you looking for in North America, as we look for above normal seasonality is kind up make up some deliveries from the second quarter? And then related to that, are we taking a normal summer shutdown in Europe which is like I get down like 10% from the second quarter? And if so, why not cut the summer schedule to short to try to clear up some up the backlog and customer deliveries?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, we just have to manage the vacation period et cetera. This is the most efficient way that managed that vacation period. So it's proven over the years its more vision way. And so, we will be down Europe a couple of thousand trucks and that will be offset plus a little bit North America.","Adam Uhlman","And then, could you talk about the capacity that you have in North America today for the MX engine. If I were to order a truck with that engine versus a Cummins engine, is there any difference in, in lead times and availability?","Ron Armstrong","No, we have just completed about $35 million investment in the Columbus engine factory to be able to increase machining capacity by about 40 engines a day. We also completed a similar size investment in Eindhoven to be able to machine MX-11 engines in Eindhoven. So, we are a good shape from engine capacity standpoint for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Rob Salmon","As we lookout to the third quarter with the delivery update, can you give us a sense if you have got a bunch of effectively red tagged trucks that are just waiting on a couple of parts in terms of seeing that sequential uptick -- excuse me, on deliveries?","Ron Armstrong","It's mostly just production rates that we anticipate.","Rob Salmon","And then, Ron, with your commentary about the used trucks I think being up about 5% to 10% compared to last year. Can you give us a sense, if that included the benefit from mix in terms of seeing a greater portion of the newer spec trucks that guys are selling? Or is that just the broader market and you think you are going to get more of a benefit in the second half as those specs start falling through your use.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I would say most of that is the broader market and there will be some benefit from the model mix, yes.","Rob Salmon","And really the smaller piece of the business, the PACCAR truck leasing. Can you give us a sense of your plans for either fleet growth there? And what you're seeing in that end market from utilization perspective?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, the utilization in the leasing market is excellent with the transportation demand. When there's supplemental capacity needed, the leasing rental trucks, there is a good demand and the leasing business ours as well as our dealers who operate PacLease franchises, they have had a really good year, and orders for lease trucks are up year-on-year. So, that\u2019s been a really good year for PacLease.","Rob Salmon","Can you remind us, how big is the percentage of the financial services that the leasing business represents for you guys?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it's about -- we have a truck portfolio of around 190,000 trucks and there is 38,000 -- 39,000 trucks in the PacLease operations. So, there is a 20% to 25%.","Rob Salmon","So, as a proportion of earnings, it's the same regardless of its being financed or leased I guess over the cycle?","Ron Armstrong","That\u2019s correct, yes.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the Company?","Ron Armstrong","We\u2019d like to thank everyone for their participation. And thank you operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR, and joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media participating, we request that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported excellent quarterly revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2012. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.8 billion compared to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2011, a 45% increase. Quarterly net income increased to $327 million, a 69% increase versus the $193 million earned a year ago. I'm very proud of our 23,200 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","Increased truck deliveries in North America, higher aftermarket sales and a growing Financial Services business contributed to PACCAR's increased profits. Our customers in North America are benefiting from increased freight tonnage and higher freight rates, which are generating good profitability and enabling them to replace their aging fleets. The vocational truck market in the U.S. and Canada remains subdued due to the low levels of new housing starts.","One of the highlights and we're very pleased with the positive response to the launch of the new Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt Model 579. These exciting new trucks are the result of a 4-year, $400 million program that designed and developed a new family of 2.1 meter-wide cabs. These new trucks expand our product range and complement our existing vehicles. For the first time in our history, Kenworth and Peterbilt have a 3-cab family. PACCAR's range of 3 cab sizes is similar in format to BMW's 3, 5 and 7 Series of luxury automobiles. I think our trucks will haul a little bit more than those wonderful BMW cars, though. These investments in new products will contribute to the company's long-term growth.","PACCAR delivered 39,800 trucks during the first quarter, and our truck deliveries were about 45% higher than the same period last year. Market pricing has improved since the first quarter of last year and coupled with increased plant utilization and improving leverage, generated higher quarterly truck gross margins of 9.2% compared to 7.8% a year ago. PACCAR does expect to deliver slightly fewer trucks, 2% to 3%, in the second quarter compared to the first quarter.","Economic uncertainties in the Eurozone have resulted in lower industry truck orders compared to last year. Most European truck manufacturers have reduced build rates and scheduled shutdown days to reflect the lower market. The good news is that freight on Germany's motorways, which is one of the most closely watched freight statistics, is comparable to last year, indicating that freight traffic throughout the Eurozone is at good levels and our customers are generating profitable results.","U.S. and Canadian industry retail sales are estimated to improve this year to a range of 210,000 to 240,000 units, up from 197,000 last year. This is being driven by ongoing replacement of the aging truck fleet and some economic growth. In Europe, the greater than 16-tonne truck market is anticipated to be in the range of 210,000 to 230,000 units.","PACCAR's business initiatives worldwide are progressing well. Capital spending is estimated to be $450 million to $550 million, with research and development at $275 million to $300 million. Construction of the new DAF assembly factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil is on schedule, and we plan to be building DAF Trucks in Brazil by the middle of 2013. Kenworth and DAF deliveries in the Andean region of South America, that is the region not included in the Mercosur, more than doubled in the first quarter of this year compared to the same quarter last year. In addition, ongoing investment in our engine family for EPA 13 and Euro 6, new product development and expanding our global purchasing efforts are all progressing on schedule.","PACCAR is enhancing its network of 15 parts distribution centers, a new $40 million, 280,000-square foot distribution center will be constructed in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. The distribution centers in Madrid, Spain and Pennsylvania are increasing their capacity with the addition of a combined 100,000 square feet of warehouse space.","Turning to PACCAR Financial. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $261 million in the first quarter compared to $241 million last year. PACCAR Financial's first quarter pretax income jumped to $71 million compared to $50 million earned in the first quarter of last year. This was the highest level of quarterly pretax income since the fourth quarter of 2007, almost 5 years ago. The excellent results benefited from lower borrowing costs, growth in portfolio balances and good used truck prices. The credit loss provisions for the first quarter were $7.5 million and past dues were 1.3%, both at very low levels.","PACCAR is well positioned to deliver the highest quality products and services to our customers through all phases of the business cycle. We're starting the year in strong fashion and are very pleased with the enthusiastic response by our customers, dealers and the press on the launch of the new Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Robin E. Easton","Operator, we'll take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Mark Mihallo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, it's actually Mark Mihallo on for Andy today. Just a few quick questions. Just firstly, can you just provide an update on your margin guidance for the year? I believe in the last call you said something along the lines of flat to potentially down gross incremental margin. And just on top of that, just the cadence that you expect in terms of margins for the year, kind of 2Q through 4Q.","Mark C. Pigott","I think the margins will be relatively stable. It's what we're seeing in the markets really around the world. I guess that's probably the forecast for the year.","Mark Mihallo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of in terms of 2Q margin, in terms of the production cut in Chillicothe, is there any expectation for kind of a sequential decline in margin in 2Q versus 1Q and then heading out to 4Q, kind of an uptick there? Any type of guidance around that?","Mark C. Pigott","Let me kind of break that into 2 parts. One, in terms of Chillicothe, where we -- the good news in the last year, we've increased the employment at Chillicothe. We have almost doubled it, and we've got a lot of wonderful employees there. We've had to make some adjustments. What probably wasn't reported was the increase in hiring in our facilities in Mexico and Australia. So kind of looking at the bigger picture, we obviously hope that we can increase production at all facilities, but sometimes that's not possible.","Mark Mihallo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, Mark. And then just a follow-up, in terms of Europe, I believe a European competitor recently was talking about European build rates remaining weakened. Obviously, you guys willing to lower, or the upper end of your forecast seems to correspond to that. But just in terms of aftermarket opportunities, it seems like this competitor was saying that they're holding up relatively well. Are you guys seeing or capturing that? Are you kind of expecting it to be better expected in the back half of the year in terms of European aftermarket opportunities?","Mark C. Pigott","That is an excellent question. Let's talk a little bit about aftermarket. Our Parts group and all the aftermarket services are performing well, and we continue to introduce a lot of exciting innovative programs, whether it's selling parts and services for our products or for our competitive brands. So that's going well. As I mentioned in the prepared statements, we're looking to expand our facilities in Eindhoven and in Madrid. So I think that bodes well for the future as we look to continue to grow. In terms of the truck side, the market overall, when you look at the greater than 16 tonne over the last 10 years, this year will be the third or fourth lowest, I guess I'd put it that way. It's going to be a reasonable market. We have made a minor adjustment to the upper end of our forecast range. The good news is that DAF just had a very successful truck show in Amsterdam at the RAI, introduced the Euro 6 and some of their new aerodynamic products. Market share is holding up well for DAF. So Eurozone is certainly in the paper for a lot of other things besides the truck market. And as that gets resolved, it may take time, I'm sure the truck market will improve. Our customers are in good shape. We meet with them on a regular basis. A lot of them came to the show in Amsterdam. There's freight to haul but like any good business people, they want to make sure what's going to happen in the next 12 to 24 months. So that needs to get resolved first. So it's going to be a reasonable year. It's one of the lower years in the last 10 years, but DAF's doing very well in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, Mark, just a clarification on your commentary about the margins. You said they think -- you think they'll be relatively stable. Can you talk about, I guess, stable relative to last year, stable relative to the first quarter? And then can you talk about -- I mean, you had originally guided to margins being flat to down last quarter. So what surprised you on the upside? And then just my last question, how do you think the market reacts in Europe ahead of Euro 6? Do you think there's a potential for any pre-buy? And then I'll get back in queue.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. A couple of good questions. Euro 6 takes effect January 1, '14, so we're still about 19 months away. A number of our competitors and DAF now has shown their engines that will meet the Euro 6. Different countries are evaluating, is there or is there not a benefit to having some sort of incentive program. I think it's still early days. I think you're talking over 1.5 years. So I think we'll start to see -- if there's going to be any sort of pre-buy, that won't really happen until next year, if it happens then. In terms of margins, Michael?","Michael T. Barkley","Yes, the -- compared to last year, our truck margins are up on a dollar basis, up 85% on 58% higher truck sales. And during the quarter, we were -- had slightly higher sales which resulted in better operating leverage, which helped us achieve a little bit higher margin percentage than what we had originally anticipated.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, but we -- I mean, I guess we still haven't seen an improvement really on the incremental margins. I mean, do you expect incremental margins to be where we were in the first quarter and consistent with last year?","Michael T. Barkley","Well the incremental margins, we had 85% increase in truck margin on a 58% increase in truck sales, which was pretty good. And we also anticipate that during the course of the year, with truck sales being down slightly that there'll be some softness in margins, but it will be minor.","Mark C. Pigott","So I'd say pretty -- echoing Michael's side, it'd pretty stable to the first quarter. And I think what we -- you guys and we have been around for a long time. In the U.S. market, this is still one of the lower markets and of course in Europe, it's the third lowest in the last 10 years. So if you can get back to the upper half in terms of market size, that tends to drive some margin improvement as people are more eager to purchase trucks, and pricing isn't as competitive. So unlike a few -- well I see some other -- a few other industries, it's being impacted by still an uneven economic recovery. The good news is that we've got strong market share, we're introducing a lot of new products and I think the Brazil is an exciting venture for PACCAR that has some opportunities for improved margins. If that seems to be the location or the region of the world where most of our competitors achieve their highest margins, and certainly PACCAR is at the premium end of the scale, that could bode well. We'll actually have to get our factory up and running and sell trucks there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, Robin and Michael, I'm wondering if you can talk about the first quarter gross profit performance on a bridge basis, the way you typically do in your Qs. And I guess specifically, can you touch on the impact of pricing net of material cost?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think again, what you saw was primarily the benefit of higher production levels. When you look at, compared to the first quarter, more trucks, some operating leverage and pricing costs are not a big factor at this point. Pretty stable and then you're getting some additional price realization, as Mark mentioned in his comments at the offset in the call.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think that's a good one. Also on the suppliers, 6, 9 months ago that was the topic that we're talking about and suppliers are in good position. I know you've heard from a few of our suppliers and will hear from more of them over the next week or 2. I think their factories are in good position. They're getting good returns. The pipelines are in good shape. One item that certainly has been in the news is Nylon 12 and the fire in the factory in Europe. I just would address that our suppliers, particularly Eaton and Parker and a few others are working that very hard. We seem to be in good shape. The whole industry obviously is discussing it. That includes the automotive groups. And the good thing and one of the things we love about this industry is that when we do have these industry opportunities, everybody rallies around and they come up with some creative solutions. So I think as Ron mentioned, I think good pricing from suppliers, good steady deliveries to our factories and people love our products. And some of you were at the Mid-America Truck Show and you could hear by the roar of the crowd when we unveiled the new Kenworth and Peterbilt, there's -- we're taking these products to the next level in terms of comfort, reliability, durability, low cost of ownership. So a lot of good things progressing.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mark, how should we think about pricing versus material cost over the balance of the year? I think at the Truck Show, we spoke about better built-in material margin on the new Kenworth and Peterbilt aerodynamic products. Are we going to see a greater tailwind on net pricing of material costs in the back half of the year?","Mark C. Pigott","I would say that it's certainly one of the -- one of the benefits of these new products is not only better performance and profitable opportunity for our customers, but some reduction in cost. But I think to have any meaningful impact, it will be next year. We're just having a very limited released start-up in terms of production.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the R&D outlook, it looks like you trimmed it at the high end. Is that a function of project timing or projects coming in below budget?","Mark C. Pigott","I think a little bit of both. We got a lot of projects, as I tried to share with you, and we got a very dedicated team who's working, and some of them have been able to achieve what they anticipate will be lower cost in some of these projects. But we got a lot going on, and it's going to be an exciting next couple of years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, can you comment on how we should think about pace of stock buyback over the course of the year and just refresh us on any capital deployment opportunities you have outside of Brazil? You had spoken in the past about potential on opportunities. Are those any closer?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well on the stock buybacks, as you're aware I think we put in our press release, we have authorization from the board, and we periodically go into the marketplace as it makes sense to repurchase shares. So that's an open authorization, and we'll just have to see how the stock's doing. That's kind of really how we're looking at it. In terms of other utilizations, one of great things about PACCAR, we got a wonderful balance sheet and we're able to take advantage of opportunities as they come up. The big project right now would be building the factory in Brazil, which is going very well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious to get your color on what's going on in the U.S. market. I mean we saw orders slowed significantly over the last couple of months versus to your point, freight tonnage is strong, the fleet is building over [ph] than it's ever been. Do you think it's just customers paused a little bit over the last couple of months just because of higher diesel prices? Do you think there was some pre-buying at the end of last year? I'd like to get your color. You are closer to those customers than any of us.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. I think the term you used is certainly the popular term right now, pause. Now when I pause my television, then I can't -- I lose the signal. I think what we're seeing here is not so much pre-buy. I think people have been ordering a good amount. There's still certain segments of our general economy, as I mentioned in my comments, sort of the construction side. And I focused in on the housing starts as one. But commercial activity is picking up in some regions, but still pretty low in a lot of regions. So that's certainly a percent of our business, and we tend to do very, very well. So that market is very low. Right now, if we get back to 225,000 for U.S. and Canada, that's replacement level or what we anticipate as replacement level. And as we talk with the customers and you probably saw a lot of them at Mid-America, they're pleased where their business is, but they're not expanding their business. There's not that many, say, acquisitions of one truck company buying another. That's -- a lot of that's been worked through the system, particularly during the recession in the last few years. So I think U.S. economy is still at pretty low levels of GDP growth. I think people are just -- they're buying what they need. They certainly recognize the very tangible benefits of having a new truck versus a truck that's 5, 6, 7, 8 years old. That can be measured in thousands of dollars per year. So I think they're just -- they're cautious. All -- their trucks are running. You don't go to a dealership or a customer and see trucks standing anymore. That's a thing of the past. So I think people are saying, \"Hey, when I really get a good deal and I think that the economy is really strong and people are buying refrigerators and more computers and fixing up their houses, then you're going to see some good growth.\" And at 225,000, it's replacement value, but it would be nice to see the 250,000 and 275,000. That could be a while.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. As one of the major capitalist's been going forward, the construction sector, I mean Sandy Cutler yesterday was talking about -- quite bullishly about broader-based construction activity and an acceleration in a number of sectors in construction. Is that kind of the next leg up that we need in European?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it is. And I think obviously, Eaton is a wonderful partner with us, and they kind of have their hand directly in the construction business with a number of the products that they sell that go into buildings. So there I think when they said they're seeing some of that on the commercial side, which is certainly a driver but we also have the residential side, it's still at -- well it's literally at 50-year low levels. So that needs a kick a bit. Because the commercial side, that's one step then you can get the residential side, another step. I think you'll see our customers are in excellent shape. When you see their financial results, the ones that are publicly traded, they're making good money. They love our products. They're excited about the new products as they come onstream. And -- but right now, we're just kind of at that level. We've been able to grow our share because people like the products. So we're expanding elsewhere like in Brazil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, a numbers question. Can you break out for us the parts revenue and the profits?","Michael T. Barkley","Well, we don't have the Parts' profits. We can tell you what Parts' margin was.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure.","Michael T. Barkley","Parts' margin was $237.9 million compared to $219.2 million, up in line with the volume growth.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then Mark, a bigger picture as to kind of following up on what Ann was talking about. In an environment where we've got 2% GDP growth plus or minus, say for several years, it seemed like that the market, overall truck market stays relatively flat over that time period. Is there anything you would think that would cause us to go one way or the other in that type of environment?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it's an excellent macro question. I mean, 2% is okay growth for the general economy. I think we may get to a point, and it may not be a truck-driven solution. It may be more in the political arena in terms of people's demand for housing and what, let's call it, the more broader financial institutions are able to do in terms of selling home inventory, and once we get that home inventory sold, how that will then ripple into new home construction. Trucking would be the beneficiary of that. I'm not sure it will actually be the driver of that. So it could be -- we could still have 2% GDP growth but if there's other, let's call it macro political or macro financial stimuli, we could really benefit from that. But our customers are really in good shape. As I mentioned, we have good financial performance from our PACCAR Financial group, the PacLease group performing very well; very, very low past dues. And as you talk with the customers, I know you do, they're reasonably bullish.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","On then a different topic, if we look at your quarterly revenue here, you got 2 quarters in a row at essentially $4.5 billion. And if you go back in 2006, you peaked at $4 billion on a quarterly rate. With your margins today, they're at the gross margin or at the EBIT -- or about 200 basis points lower. What needs to happen to be able to close that gap here, and do you think you could -- that can happen?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it goes back to the discussion we had earlier about the markets. The fact that in Europe, the market currently this year is expected to be about the third lowest in the last 10. In North America, U.S. and Canada, it's fourth or fifth highest out of 10. So the markets just aren't as strong as we've seen historically. We've seen some of those peak margin levels. So at stronger market, stronger market conditions, I think there's upside to the margins.","Mark C. Pigott","And I would add one point to I think Ron stated very clearly, is that certainly there's been a lot of additional cost, and we've talked about this in the past, in terms of just the -- meeting the different EPA and European environmental regulation. I think the good news is that over time, the whole industry and usually PACCAR is the leader, you work with our suppliers and keep refining the cost of these after treatment systems, meaning reducing the cost. These are big cost segments to absorb, certainly for our customers. And I would say, having been in the industry for 35 years, over the last 10 years have been the biggest series of cost adjustments that we've seen in 35 years. And I think that probably needs to get a little bit more airtime. We didn't see it in the '70s, '80s, '90s but certainly from, say, 2000, 2002 on, we've seen it. And so the good news is we continue to work with our great suppliers like Cummins and others on reducing that cost. If we can then couple that with a stronger general economy that drives the demand for more trucks, as you've seen in your experiences as a stronger market people, they're a little bit more willing to pay more probably just for about for any item, but I'm talking about trucks now. So reduce the cost of the after treatment, get a stronger market and increase our pricing and we'll be doing very well. We're already doing very well. We had a great quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about credit conditions in Europe, and maybe the opportunity banks stepping back gives to your Financial Services business?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, I think we've -- we continue to not experience credit demand for our customers. They're able to get their trucks financed. PACCAR Financial in Europe has been beneficiary. They've seen their market share grow from 20% to 24% last year. So a record share level for them in 2011, and we continue to see strong share performance in the first quarter. So our portfolio's performing very well and we see further potential for growth as truck sales evolve.","Mark C. Pigott","And I think we've had PACCAR Financial in Europe for 10 years. So this is our 10-year anniversary or thereabouts, and so we're very pleased with the progress being made there. The dealers, it's just part of their integrated selling approach. The customers are comfortable and you recognize if you're customer and you have a 20-year relationship with a bank, it takes a while to shift allegiance to a different credit source. But they can see the benefit of working with one supplier, the dealer who supplies the trucks, the parts, the after service and the finance. So that's very good. Good credit availability in all our markets. That's really good news.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And in North America, can you talk a little bit about the penetration of the engines here and maybe the factors that your customers are looking at today to decide whether to go with your 13-liter engine or Cummins' 15-liter engine?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, sure. Well we're very pleased. We've installed 22,000 engines of the PACCAR MX engines. They're doing well. We've got customers that are reporting excellent fuel economy improvements. And I just -- so we're very pleased. The factory continues to increase its production. I think you had an opportunity to visit it and if you haven't, I highly recommend it. One macro element that probably hasn't gotten a lot of press is that when we look at the industry in total for the first time in North America, 13-liter engines are now selling slightly ahead of 15-liter engines. And that's a little bit of a -- not a little bit, it's quite a sea change and there's a couple of reasons. First of all, there's still a good demand for 15-liter and we are very happy to supply 15-liter. Our customers love them. But the 13-liter brings a lower price, 300, 400 pounds lower weight. It can deliver a better fuel economy and it's just a very proven engine worldwide. So I think in terms of the timing, I have to take my hat off to our engine design group and production people because literally for the first time, I'd say in history, the 13-liter is now selling slightly ahead of the 15-liter. So it's exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I had a question sort of on that same 13-, 15-liter and PACCAR engine line of questioning. I was curious as to -- of the trucks you're putting out now, what sort percentage of those are with growing [ph] engine, what -- how is that -- what kind of share are you getting there?","Mark C. Pigott","Still the 25% to 30% range. And it's exactly on schedule. And I'd say as we sell more of them and the customers are gaining the benefits, the word-of-mouth and the reports are positive and it's good.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. I'm kind of curious as to what your customers are saying about driver shortages and the CSA impact and improving economy and competing for labor and how that impacts their truck buying decision.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it is interesting because typically when housing is down, that actually frees up people for the freight truck industry in this slow period. It appears that a certain number, I don't have the exact percent, of those potential drivers who are working in housing decided, \"No, I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to maybe spend the time away from the family.\" And there's probably overlaid on top of that some element in terms of the higher qualification standards which is good for the industry in terms of getting -- we already have -- the industry has great, great drivers and putting, let's call it, a formal guideline, will continue to strengthen the great industry. So there hasn't really been an issue in terms of driver shortage for many of our customers, particularly ones who are buying new trucks. They're attractive. They get good fuel economy. They're very comfortable and people that may not have been driving for a few years are very pleasantly surprised when they get into a new vehicle because they really evolved over the last 3 to 5 years. So yes, it's healthy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of short-term questions, a lot has been asked and answered. On the positive pricing, does that include Europe and Australia?","Mark C. Pigott","I'm not sure what your question is.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Oh, in your comments, you talked about a positive pricing environment and clearly, U.S. is in there. I'm just wondering if that positive pricing environment is something global or if it is driven by the U.S. and not existing in Europe and Australia.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, Australia is good. Mexico is good. South America is good. I think Europe is probably relatively flat, stable. Does that answer it?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And then short term, are you seeing any demand dampening from some of the reported slumping activity in portions of the U.S. energy sector, mainly the hydraulic frac-ing?","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, that's a good question. Let me take it from a slightly different approach. The dealers that we've had in, let's call it, the shale, oil areas, they've seen demand that has been unprecedented whether it's in portions of Canada or Pennsylvania or the Dakotas, it's been pretty amazing. To be a dealer there is to do well. So I think in terms of just the frac-ing itself, I can't really comment on that. I don't think I can really relate that to sort of the trucking demand. But sort of the general focus on oil and gas has really been strong in terms of driving a lot of the, let's call it, local or super local regions. There's been a lot of demand for trucks in those regions. Let me just sort of segue off of that in terms of there's been some discussion about alternative fuels, LNG, CNG. And I think once again the good news is that PACCAR is a leader in offering the complete range of products including hybrid. We've got a strong market share, over 30%. And certainly in the press, maybe focused a little bit more on the car side than the truck side, but we've got good customers who like to buy that product. I think over time what will be driving that particular industry is the difference between the pricing for diesel and, let's call it, gas. What's going to be the differential, obviously the infrastructure in North America in terms of offering LNG, CNG is very, very small compared to diesel outlets. And I think we also have to recognize that the LNG or CNG in terms of the number of miles you can drive on 100 gallons of whatever the equivalent fuel you're using is about half of what you can get with diesel. So these are some of the elements that are not typically brought up in the press but when you're operating a truck company, you're looking at those very, very carefully. So the good news is PACCAR's a leader. We got the product. If that's what you want to buy, we're happy to sell it to you.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On that last one, on the alternative fuels, are you recognizing that you have the flexibility to ramp up demand if it manifests itself? Are you currently looking at, particularly some of the nat gas power potential as more of a niche market? Or is it something that over time, maybe 5 years, could approach a meaningful size of the market?","Mark C. Pigott","Well that is a question that's obviously getting debated in the press on, let's call it, a macro level. Right now it's a niche market. It's less than 1% of industry demand. The people who want it are generally pretty happy with it and we certainly are happy to build them and deliver them. Looking out 5 years, it's really going to be impacted by how fast will the buildout of the supply infrastructure be. That's important. The cost is almost -- it's almost twice the cost of just buying a normal Class 8 truck. So you got to have an operating environment that you can recover that cost. And for many, many customers, they just don't see where it's viable. So 5 years out, I think we maybe should be looking 10 years out. And if you look at the history in the automobile of hybrids and people like Toyota are probably leaders on hybrids, that's still a very, very small percent of the vehicles. I'm reading an interesting statistic in one of the magazines that the number of people who buy a second hybrid is roughly 25%. What that means is 75% of people that buy a hybrid don't buy another one because it's about 50% more expensive to buy it. So anyway, we're ready, willing and able and have a full range of product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Buckingham Research.","Joel G. Tiss - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So do you think the 2013 trucks coming out will be pricing and mix improvement will be enough to that they will notice it on your margins and your incremental margins?","Mark C. Pigott","You're talking about for North America?","Joel G. Tiss - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes. And when are those products going to hit? Probably late summer, right, or early fall?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that's right. That's right, but probably later in the year. I think there are some benefits to the new engine, that are the new EPA 13, that could have some minor positive benefit, but you probably won't see it this year, probably more next year.","Joel G. Tiss - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And any signs that the owner operators are coming back at all? There are whispers of it at the end of the show, but I don't know.","Mark C. Pigott","Were you at the show?","Joel G. Tiss - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well, the -- we talked about owner operators. We love all our customers. I think it has to be taken in a broader light for any industry and that these owner operators, they're small businesspeople, they're very dedicated, they're wonderful customers. But I think to continue to grow, they typically align themselves with a larger company so they get whether it's the health care benefits, they get regular freight, they know the routing, they might have some sort of maintenance programs with a larger fleet. So I think the concept of the owner operator, it's a wonderful thought. But I think it's moving on to, I would now say, it's sort of small, medium and large businesses. That's the way I kind of look at it.","Joel G. Tiss - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. Yes, I'm just trying to gauge if the negative mix shift that we've seen has run its course and if we can see enough profitability improvement, even if the U.S. and Western Europe stay depressed over the next 2 years to continue to see some of it.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think the mix has been very positive. We've seen continued growth as -- we sell to like all the medium, large and extra-large customers. That's great business or great customers, great partners. And I think it's all good. It's all good. And that -- say, we're in a strong position and that you saw the new products we're coming out with. There's been great interest from a lot of people. And we're just bringing in the, let's call it, medium-sized cabover product. And there's been a lot of interest, particularly for people in intercity, urban distribution are very interested in that. So right now, we have the broadest lineup of products in our history, and I think that positions PACCAR very, very well. We're very excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Quick question for you on North American market share. If I look at North America overall, including Mexico and I guess exports, your market share I think was a record in terms of the data that I have about almost 32%, which was up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Obviously, that's a very impressive result. And I'm just wondering if the oil and gas business that you talked about earlier was having a significant impact on that. And Alison Transmission said yesterday afternoon that they're seeing some cuts from oil and gas customers in terms of orders. So I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of a sense of how you expect your market share to develop throughout the year and what impact do you expect oil and gas sector to have?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Well a good question. The oil and gas sector for us is they're very good customers, but it has sort of minimal impact on market share for us. We are -- our market share is driven by, right now, on-highway haulers. We sell certainly to the oil and gas and other groups and we love working with them, but market share is really very, very minimal. I think the growth has just been people like the Kenworth and Peterbilt product. As you followed our company, you've recognized that first is really build the premium product and premium service and over time, the market share has increased as a result of that. People love the product. It's the low cost to operate. There's a lot of pride driving our products around the world. So in terms of our share, probably be in about the same range you're looking at. But that's not the #1 driver for us. The #1 driver is great premium product and that's what we work on hard every day, highest quality.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And a follow-up on Brazil. There were some recent announcements of new local content regulations essentially trying to localize more of the supply base down there. Has that had any impact in terms of your plans in terms of building out the facility? I mean, specifically on engines, I believe you had said that you're planning on exporting from Mississippi. Is that still the case?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, you are correct that Brazil as a country continues to evaluate local content requirements. Once again, the good news is we meet all the requirements. That is certainly one of the first areas that we took a very hard evaluation of. The vast majority of our suppliers have been in Brazil, are in Brazil. We're working with them closely. In terms of the engine, we'll be sourcing essentially the vast majority of the content of the engine in Brazil. And if Mississippi was mentioned one time, maybe that was a thought. But we have suppliers in Brazil and we'll be sourcing a large percentage of the content in Brazil. We may do some additional machining or things outside of the country, but it's being bought in Brazil.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. But you are planning to be vertically integrated on engine pressure in Brazil.","Mark C. Pigott","Well I mean, we're going to be -- we'll only offer the PACCAR engine. I think that may be one part of your question. We're buying the major components, the heads, the blocks in Brazil.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great.","Mark C. Pigott","And that's the big elements, and those are certainly the big cost drivers for an engine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just one quick question. I know it's kind of basic, but I wonder if you could just walk through pricing and how and the timing of when it flows through. My impression is you took us from a big hit on the components on the engine with the '10 and that you've been slowly recouping that. And I wondered especially this year whether you get the list price increase benefit in 1Q, 2Q, 3Q time frame. And you described the pricing as being sort of smooth throughout the year, so I just wanted to understand how that flows through.","Mark C. Pigott","I think you actually described it pretty well. You absorb these large cost increments and then you work with suppliers and try to keep refining it. The customers who are the -- they're the final judge on what they're going to purchase, work through. They see the benefits of buying the new componentry. They are perhaps a little more willing to pay a little bit more because they can see the benefit will come to their bottom line. And in terms of this year, I think suppliers are in good shape. We've got the vast majority of our agreements or multiple year long-term agreements with our suppliers. So I think it should really be -- I think it should be very smooth in terms of supplier cost increases affecting us. And as a result, I think the pricing will be stable. Because I think you also have to incorporate what's going to be happening to the general economy, and that's more than just trucking.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Your list price increases though, when would that sort of benefit your revenue for the current model year?","Mark C. Pigott","It's very similar to the rest of the industry. You either have 1 or 2 list price increases during the year. So at the beginning of the year and the middle of the year is pretty typical. And so that's the timing. And you hope that it'll have some impact. That's really all I can offer on that.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","That's fine. And then if I can ask you -- you kind of addressed this, Mark, just a second ago, but the market share look for throughout the year -- the build -- your share has been phenomenal. The build rate in the first quarter were a little bit strange with one of your larger competitors having sort of a lower build rate. And I just wondered if you could address whether your market share and build is similar to your market share in the order book. In other words, whether you would've built more of our backlog down or whether just the build is a true reflection of the share you've gained in the order book as well.","Mark C. Pigott","I think our share, I think -- I just want to jump in. We build the highest-quality product in the industry. That's what we provide to our customers. And we've been very fortunate and we thank our customers for buying them. And that's what has driven the share. I think our production, our dealers are in very good shape. Their inventory is in good shape. So when we build it, it gets to our customers and they register it and that's what reflects the shares, so it's a pretty straightforward process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on what your order trends have been like in the U.S. and in Europe. I'm trying to put the build reduction in the second quarter of 2% to 3% in perspective so we can understand why the builds are going down.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, you bet.","Michael T. Barkley","Our order intake in the first quarter was similar to the fourth quarter of 2011, if that's what your question was.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, and we had some adjustments, and you're aware of those. In Europe, it's pretty stable. We took the adjustments essentially in the fourth quarter, a little bit in January. And in North America, the orders have seen some decline on the industry for the industry. And we'll also see -- I think Ann asked the question, are we sort of in a pause mode. So we reflect that also as our competitors do. So we're saying second quarter might be 2% to 3% down and first quarter we got some improvement in other markets. Mexico and Australia and South America's going well. So that's kind of where we are.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, great. And then congrats on the success with the Peterbilt awards.","Mark C. Pigott","Appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I'm wondering, going back to the discussion about vocational. If you're able to size what the construction market could be for PACCAR. It sounds like it's meaningful just so we think about the upside opportunity as the market starts to come back.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, why don't we take that off-line, because that's a pretty complicated answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Most asked and answered, but appreciate you sticking around.","Mark C. Pigott","We're always happy to talk.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just to tag along -- it's a couple of tag-along questions. If I can maybe try and approach that last question in a different way. Can you frame how much the vocational business has declined for you from peak to where it is today?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it's -- why don't we take that off -- let's not make something that it's not. We'd love to have house building strong again. That would be wonderful because it's timber, it's concrete, it's glass, it's carpets, it's refrigerators. It's a whole host of products that obviously many, many industries are involved with. And the good news, our share has gone up. The Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF have done a fantastic job of growing on-highway business. We're into many, many more medium and large customers. So I think that's really the focus. But we're selling to customers who are out there. That's pretty basic.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just switching over back to the engine side then, can you give us I guess your build rate? And I think last quarter, you had talked about targeting 130 units, 130 a day, where we are in the ramp to that number and kind of your capacity utilization?","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. We've got plenty of capacity. That's the good news. 130 is not an accurate number, but we're increasing it. And over the course of the next 12 month, we're looking to double the engine production, and that's kind of why we're on schedule.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I've just got a couple of quick follow-ups. Just on the Parts business, you had said the top line was up basically in line with the profit growth, so margins are kind of similar as they were last year. Is that what...","Michael T. Barkley","That's correct.","Mark C. Pigott","Correct.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's what I thought. And I assume volumes in the quarter were pretty much down slightly in line with the guidance, correct?","Michael T. Barkley","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes.","Michael T. Barkley","Compared to the fourth quarter?","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, compared to the fourth quarter, yes.","Michael T. Barkley","That's correct, down about 2% or 3%.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, you bet.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And, Mark, I just wanted to follow up on the earlier question about build versus sales. You clearly have made strong progress in both the U.S. and Canada taking market share. But it did look like the production was a little bit higher at least with the public data that we have than the sales rate. That's just kind of timing of orders. Could you could help...","Mark C. Pigott","Very simple. Yes, just timing.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So kind of going forward, build and sales kind of equal to each other. That's how we should think about it?","Mark C. Pigott","That's typically the way we look at it. You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Basili Alukos from Morningstar.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","It seems like my questions -- but I'll come and get it at a different perspective. When you thought about building the engine facility, kind of going back to when you started, what did you expect or what were your goal for production rates to be so that the engines would ultimately be accretive to gross margins? At least the way I think about it because you're at a lower production rates -- or penetration rate on your engines, you're having that fixed cost or holding down gross margins. So I'm just trying to get a sense...","Mark C. Pigott","No, it's a good question, but I don't think it's quite -- reflects what's actually going on. We're right on target. It's accretive and it's been excellent for our customers obviously benefiting for our dealers because it gets them into the engine powertrain business which is also good on, let's call it, the aftermarket support. So no, it gives us additional global volume which is a real benefit when we're talking with suppliers. And it also increases our expertise in engines, which as we look at doing things like Brazil, just enhances our opportunities to deal with customers around the world. So it's been a real win, a real win.","Basili Alukos - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. That helps. And then I just want to follow back, you'd said kind of first time 13-liter engines are selling slightly ahead of 15. Do you think that the pie is shifting as more people are going more towards 13, or is it because maybe rail is becoming more efficient, you're seeing those 15-liter engine customers transferring their load to rails and so the pie is shrinking and as a result...","Mark C. Pigott","That's a great theoretical question. I think people enjoy the benefits of the 13-liter. I think we'll just leave it at that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of line of Brian Rayle from Northcoast Research.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Again, most questions have been answered. Just if we could look into Europe, I mean, I know you have the long-term target for 20% market share, obviously...","Mark C. Pigott","And we're at 15.5%.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Right. 15.5% was the end of the first quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it was.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Okay. Obviously, your market share targets in North America have been lower. And you've kind of blown past those. Is 20% where you really think the ceiling is or something that's achievable here in the near term...","Mark C. Pigott","20% for Europe?","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Yes. You could throw it out as a medium-term goal.","Mark C. Pigott","I know. It is a medium-term goal. It continues to be the medium-term goal, and it's a wonderful goal.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations and joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.","Preston Feight","Good morning. Harrie Schippers and I will update you on our excellent fourth quarter and record full year 2019 results and business highlights. Thanks to PACCAR's outstanding employees around the world, 2019 was the best year in the company's 114 year history. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $25.6 billion and record net income of $2.39 billion, a 9.3% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR strong financial performance in 2019 benefited from PACCAR Parts record pre-tax profits of $831 million and PACCAR Financial Services pre-tax profits of $299 million. PACCAR has achieved 81 consecutive years of net income and a total shareholder return in 2019 of 45%. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941. In 2019, PACCAR declared dividends of $3.58 per share a 16% increase over 2018. Total dividends declared were a record $1.24 billion.","PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $6.1 billion and fourth quarter net income was $531 million. PACCAR delivered 45,700 trucks during the fourth quarter compared to 49,300 in the third quarter. There were fewer build days and lower build rates in North America compared to the third quarter. [Indiscernible] remained steady.","The U.S. economy performed well in 2019, which contributed to a strong truck market. In 2019, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 309,000 units, the second highest truck sales in history. During 2019, Kenworth and Peterbilt combined market share increased to 30% compared to 29.4% in the prior year. In 2020, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by about 2%. The new U.S. MCA and China Phase 1 trade agreements could provide upside in the economy and are good for PACCAR. We estimate that 2020 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market to be in a range of 230,000 to 260,000 vehicles. European above 16-tonne truck registrations were 320,000 vehicles in 2019, reflecting continued robust customer demand after several years of steady economic growth. DAF delivered a strong 16.2% market share. In 2020, the European economies are projected to continue growing and we expect another excellent truck market with above 16-tonne registrations in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles.","I would like to recognize PACCAR's high performing Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF dealers who are the best in the industry and important contributors to our success. Truck and parts gross margins were 14.4% in the fourth quarter. Truck pricing increased during the quarter, more than offsetting costs. In the first quarter, we expect deliveries to be 5% to 7% lower than the fourth quarter due to normalized markets and build rates in North America. First quarter truck and parts gross margins are estimated to be around 14%. PACCAR continues to take a rigorous approach to controlling costs throughout the business cycle and delivers industry-leading operating margins.","Other 2019 accomplishments included PACCAR delivering a record 199,000 trucks worldwide. Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF expanding the range of battery electric, hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell trucks in field testing with customers; and South American deliveries increasing by 60%. The company's focus on sustainable business practices were recognized by the environmental reporting firm CDP. For the second consecutive year, PACCAR achieved an A rating, which puts us in the top 2% of more than 8,000 companies which report to CDP. PACCAR is one of only 35 companies in the United States to earn the A rating. In addition, we're proud that Peterbilt, Kenworth and PACCAR Parts were recognized as top workplaces for women by the organization Women in Trucking. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services, and PACCAR's investments in future growth.","Harrie Schippers","Thanks, Preston. In 2019, PACCAR Parts generated record annual revenues of more than $4 billion and record annual pre-tax profit of $831 million. Annual parts revenue grew 5% and profit grew 8% compared to 2018. Parts fourth quarter revenues were $994 million and quarterly pre-tax profit was a strong $205 million.","PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. At the same time, PACCAR has consistently expanded its network of parts distribution centers such as the ones opening this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Ponta Grossa, Brazil. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers have made large investments to increase their service capacity. The growing part of PACCAR trucks and power trains and the enhanced parts distribution and service network grant [ph] future long-term growth. In 2020, we estimate part sales to grow by 4% to 6%.","PACCAR Financial Services achieved 2019 records in annual revenues of $1.48 billion, new business volume of $5.6 billion, and portfolio assets of $16.1 billion. The portfolio continues to perform well with low past dues and low credit losses. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was $68 million, the same as in the third quarter. PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services profit contributions enhance PACCAR's financial results through all phases of the business cycle. I'm pleased to share that in 2019, PACCAR was recognized for its products and manufacturing innovations. DAF earned Truck of the Year awards in the U.K., Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia and the Green Truck Logistics Solution Award in Germany.","Kenworth Chillicothe and Peterbilt Denton each earned a prestigious 2019 Manufacturing Leadership Award from the National Association of Manufacturers. At the CES Technology Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, PACCAR showcased a Level 4 autonomous vehicle and two battery electric trucks. We had a terrific turnout of people interested in PACCAR technology and the opportunity to see the trucks first-hand. Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF have each announced that they will begin producing alternative powertrain trucks in the next 12 to 18 months. PACCAR is a leader in all powertrain technologies that drive our industry including diesel, battery, hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell. PACCAR invested a record $744 million in capital and $327 million in R&D expenses last year. In 2020, we're planning capital investments in the range of $625 million to $675 million and R&D expenses of $310 to $340 million. These capital and R&D projects will develop the next generation of fuel-efficient vehicles and enhance the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.","Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Timothy Thein","Thank you. Good morning. Preston, maybe, the first one just on the guidance here for the first quarter. I'm looking at build rate in the industry level at least projected build plans for North America calling for a modest -- a small sequential step up from 4Q to 1Q and I'm curious how PACCAR fits into that in terms of within the context of that I think you said down 5% to 7% deliveries where North America fits in relative to Europe and some of the other markets?","Preston Feight","Sure, as we just said, we do expect deliveries to be overall 5% to 7% lower and that's kind of matching to where the market really is. North America is more of that than Europe is. Europe's been fairly stable for us through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and real issues matching to where the normalized market has become where we're seeing the normalized market. So it's nice for us as we have a pretty good percentage of the backlog, I think it is roughly 34% of the backlog and compared to the inventory where there -- we are a smaller percentage of the inventory. In fact, we only have about two months' worth of inventory, 2.5 months of inventory sitting in there. So we are in pretty good shape that way and it's just normalizing to the market.","Timothy Thein","Okay, all right and then on the margins in the first quarter, there is obviously, you'll get a little bit more help from a seasonal perspective in the second quarter, but how are you considering that roughly 14% margin today in the first quarter relative to the full year?","Preston Feight","So when you look at the first quarter and it's kind of where we stop our guidance to it is we look at the 14%, I think that's really continuing to deliver as PACCAR does excellent industry leading margins and that's kind of consistently good for us and we're pleased to be able to deliver that and that's really because of the performance of our teams on the truck side, the financial services side, and the Parts team and in composite that works really well.","Timothy Thein","Alrighty, I will now pass it on. Thank you.","Preston Feight","Okay, thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Thompson Rich [ph] on behalf of Ann.","Preston Feight","Hello.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, quick question on SG&A, which came in a bit higher than we had modeled for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about what drove the year-on-year increase. Is Q4 a fair run rate for 2020?","Preston Feight","When we look at SG&A, one of the nice things for PACCAR is we have the lowest SG&A in the industry by a [ph] substantial. We do a great job of managing that. As a percentage of sales, it was actually down in 2019 at the end of the year and we always take a look, we have a rigorous approach to cost control at all elements of the business both in up cycles and down cycles and we continue to manage that cost to the great levels we maintain. It's how we think about it. Consider very little things, very little is fixed costs and just try to do a great job.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And can you discuss new orders in North America and Europe for PACCAR relative to the industry. I think last quarter you noted your backlog represented 36% of the industry backlog. Where does it stand at the end of Q4?","Preston Feight","Sure, our backlog is really sitting around 34% is what we have now. As we look at orders, orders are a complicated thing because it depends on everybody's inputs for what's an order and what's been canceled. So what we think about more is we make sure that what we're building has a firm order a customer name on it, and that's what we do and so we've been able to adjust our build rates aligned with our orders and that carries us forward as we look into next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Stephen Volkmann","Good morning, gentlemen. I'm curious, Preston, based on what you know today, obviously things could change, but are the run rates for each of your factories kind of what you'd expect to be sort of stable through the year or do you think at some point there will be another production cut needed?","Preston Feight","I think we think about it in a little bit more close in view than that. We think about whether the orders we have right now present the backlog we need to keep the factories running smoothly and that's where we're at right now. We've continued to adjust as I said, we think, first quarter's deliveries will be down 5% to 7% and build kind of matches that. Actually, it has to tie together. So that's where we're thinking about in the first quarter. We are operating in what we think is a good economy, GDP growth is going to be up almost 2% in the U.S. We think European GDP is growing. So there is some positive reasons to think about the economy and the operating environment. So we'll see what happens through the course of the year as far as build.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, thanks. And can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of used pricing and I'll pass it on.","Preston Feight","Sure, used pricing as we said in the last quarterly is continuing to be a headwind. I think in the last time we talked about it being somewhere in the double-digit declines and so a nice thing for being part of PACCAR, as we have an amazing team in our PACCAR Financial Services Group that does a great job of managing the used trucks. We sell the best trucks in the industry and the second owners love buying PACCAR products. It's really one of our inherent advantages and the other part of it is, I think we continue to invest in our used truck organization so that we add new used truck centers throughout Europe and North America to make sure that we are meeting the market needs as we grow our market share, it means there is ultimately more used trucks and we want to take care of our customers with those used truck centers.","Stephen Volkmann","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Andrew Casey","I want to kind of flip over to Financial Services. Revenue was quite strong. Can you comment on what drove the strength in revenue and then also within the Financial Services, the provision for losses on receivables dropped on an absolute basis sequentially against what continues to be a pretty challenging used truck price environment that you just described and I'm just wondering what the drivers were for that as well?","Preston Feight","Sure. Harry, you want to?","Harrie Schippers","Sure. So the PACCAR Financial had a good quarter. We have a good portfolio, record revenues, so that drives a lot of the profit improvement, but like Preston said used trucks continue to be a headwind for the finance company. We expect that that will continue in the first quarter and customers continue to pay their bills. Past dues are low, below 1% and credit losses are favorable too. So we expect with all of that the first quarter results of the finance company to be very similar to the fourth quarter.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you and just Harrie, back on the revenue, it went up pretty significantly year-over-year, but also sequentially -- was there any?","Harrie Schippers","Sure, some of that reflects the increased volume of used truck sales that flow through the finance company.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thank you very much.","Harrie Schippers","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, hi, good morning and good afternoon everyone. I'm wondering if you could please talk about what you're seeing out of your competitors in the U.S. and Canada. Typically, when we are heading into a production downturn, you folks are the first to cut production and your market share in the initial stages of a downturn is typically lower as a result and this time your production share actually went up in the first quarter, a reduction here, can you just talk about what you're seeing out of your competitors and what's driving the different cadence in terms of your production share in this fourth quarter compared to the past couple of production downturns?","Preston Feight","Well, what we experience right now is we have just fantastic products out there with great dealer network, great products out there, and I think there just is strong demand for our products. This really is simply as it can be put as people want to drive the best trucks and have the best services and the best powertrains and that's what we offer. So we build again -- coming back to what -- we build to what an order -- to the orders we have and that's driving our increase in share and that's as simple as we think about it, it's really kind of a nice picture for us because they're great products.","Unidentified Analyst","And when you look at the overall inventory picture for the industry. So we're exiting '19 with about 73,000 trucks in inventory, which if you apply prior cycles, looks like the industry need to take out about 20,000, maybe 30,000 trucks out of dealer inventories. What does that picture look like for PACCAR just as the natural transition for some custom end applications that are completed at the dealer site, how much do you anticipate your dealer inventories coming down in '20.","Preston Feight","It's a good question. Our inventories are in a really good shape. You said 73,000. So that's kind of a round number. If I use a round number for us, call it 18,000 of Kenworth and Peterbilt combined. It obviously depends when you start it, but as we have 30% of the market share, we really only have 25% of the inventory. So that says again that we're in pretty good condition and some of that inventory, quite a bit of that inventory is with body builders right now. So we have the leader in the vocational market and so some of those trucks are getting bodies put onto them right now.","Unidentified Analyst","And then, on the parts business; you folks have continued to have pretty steady performance even though there has been some puts and takes for freight markets, can you just talk about in your outlook for 4% to 6% growth how much is the contribution from your engines hitting the sweet spot -- the new truck lineup hitting the sweet spot for parts consumption versus underlying freight traffic. Can you just give us a bit context directionally how you're thinking about the pieces relative to the outlook?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think that there is a couple of things going on and the parts team continues to do an outstanding job. They have great technologies they are employing. It is something that we maybe don't give enough sharing of. Their e-commerce program is outstanding and that's doing a great job of making sure we have the right products at the right places. As we mentioned in our earlier comments, we're investing in distribution centers as well. A new distribution center coming online this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, another one in Ponta Grossa in Brazil. Those contribute to parts performance. We continue to grow our proprietary power trains you mentioned. So I wouldn't say that's stable. That's a growing opportunity for us. Last year, we finished at 43% for engine sales being with our MX engines. So that's great. It was 47% actually in the fourth quarter. That's another opportunity for us. You mentioned the great trucks and the growing share they contribute to the parts teams growth. There's just a lot of great things happening on the parts team and so we have a great future to look forward to there.","Unidentified Analyst","So you don't need really strong pickup in freight volumes to get the 4% to 6% growth target?","Preston Feight","No, I think what you see is the freight volume does drive demand, but it's really about the size of the part bigger -- bigger influences or size of the part, size of your proprietary content and that takes a few years to mature where parts consumption is really growing. Again, looking forward, I think that we have a great amount of freight being hauled right. Freight tonnage was up last year over 3% and so that's going to contribute to utilization, we agree with you on that.","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.","Preston Feight","Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, good morning guys. I just had a question on decremental margin. I mean, if you go back to 2016, you seem to have sort of a similar revenue composition of down truck production but very steady parts and that translated into kind of 15%-ish type decremental gross margin pre-R&D. Is there any reason why you shouldn't be able to sustain a similar level of performance or anything to think about this time around versus then?","Preston Feight","No, I think you characterized it well and then we think about incrementals and decrementals in that 15% to 20% range and so what as you said, we saw in the 2016 time frame and I think that's a nice way to look at it going forward.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, great. And then the parts business has remained very resilient but certainly did decelerate a bit as the year kind of grinded on. Are you seeing any type of maintenance deferrals amid softer market conditions and when you say that you expect the business to be up 4% to 6% in 2020, is that somewhat second half weighted or do you think we'll see this acceleration back to that growth trajectory out of the gate in the first half of the year?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think that the 4% to 6% obviously is what we said for how we look at it going forward and I don't think I would try to stratify that by quarter. I think it's going to be good performance throughout. Obviously, there can always be moments of cyclicality that are impossible to kind of guess where people are going to be by weeks or a month, but in general with great freight volumes, a great parts team, the right product lineups and the right investments, it's going to continue to deliver.","Ross Gilardi","And then just on the SG&A, the question you got before. Are you trying to say that SG&A as a percentage of sales overall should be roughly similar to where it was in 2019?","Preston Feight","Well, that's, if you go back and look, that's where SG&A has kind of run for us. Again, comparing it to the industry, it's significantly, the leanness of PACCAR shows through and we continue to do a great job of managing that SG&A and I think we'll continue to do that going forward.","Ken Hastings","Well, I think the context of the prior question was just that it did jump a little bit in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So just realistically, if we're looking at it for the full year, I'm just trying to get a sense if I take your sales if it's going to --","Preston Feight","Take a longer view of it and look where PACCAR has historically performed and know that we'll perform in that same level, as I think I would guess I'd share is we will continue to rigorously manage our costs and control them and make the right decisions to build the future of the company in a great way.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. And then just lastly on the R&D side, I mean you're guiding to sort of stable R&D, but in the context of getting to production models for your alternative powertrain models over the next year and a half, how should we think about that. I guess I'm a little bit surprised that that number is not ramping up a little bit as you're moving in that direction?","Preston Feight","I think we have an amazing team of engineering people around the world and they're doing a fantastic job of looking at how we should go to production. We're working closely with all the customers who's interest is in alternative powertrains and we'll have the right technologies for those customers when it comes time. We continue to do that in PACCAR's way which is with good decision, making prudent investments, and leveraging our supply base and the other companies that are out there.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks very much.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. I guess two follow up questions one within the U.S. when you're talking about your orders and your backlog, can you distinguish between what you're seeing on the vocational side versus line-haul side. If there is any variation there and then just second a nuance when you're talking about Europe relative to the retail sales guide and relative to what other customers have come out to set it sounds like you're seeing Europe sort of more stable. I'm just wondering if Europe is trending a little better than what you would have thought so far and if so what geographies are driving that? Thank you.","Preston Feight","Let's take the first part of the question, I think we are the leaders in the vocational market, Peterbilt and Kenworth are, and they do a great job of that. The vocational market is doing really well throughout U.S. and Canada. Housing start is up, construction being strong. PACCAR does a great job there and so that's a good percentage of our orders. We're obviously pleased with how that's working and feel like that will continue through the course of the year as the economy develops. I think from the European side of the question, I think Europe is working the way we thought it might work into the first quarter where our build rates have been stable there for two quarters now, more than two quarters and we're delivering good market share and people are loving the DAF trucks. Freight continues to be moved from Central and Eastern Europe into Western Europe. That's kind of a continuing trend line -- macro trend and we benefit from that because DAF is a market leader in those areas and it really contributes to our success.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Wondering how you feel about the second half visibility and your confidence in the outlook, obviously in the first half you have more backlog, but curious how you formed your full year market view and your assumptions in the first half versus the second half?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think what we did is we said that we have a growing economy. So that's contributory. We're very close with all our customers and we spend a lot of time talking to them about how their businesses are working because that's really the underlying principle for how our build will develop. In the last even few weeks last week or two, I've talked to several of my friends that are refrigerated carriers, flatbed haulers, and truckload carriers throughout the country just to see how their businesses are running, they're running well and yet, we still feel like there will be some, there was probably an over-buy in 2018\/2019 and so that's going to normalize itself into the 230,000 to 260,000 kind of a market for U.S. and Canada.","Steven Fisher","Are those customers telling you that they're going to start stepping up their orders at some particular point in the year to be able to hit that -- make that 230,000 to 260,000 market number work?","Preston Feight","It's not that specific. I think people buy trucks when they need them and there is a huge population of people buying trucks, so it would be not accurate to model it that way, not that specifically.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then just one quick one on the FinCo as you think about 2020, should we sort of carry forward this Q4 profitability level for the whole year of 2020 or do you think there would be some fluctuations on that relative to just demand and used values.","Preston Feight","I think the team has done a really nice job in the FinCo of delivering good performance. We expect that performance to deliver through the first quarter and then we'll watch as the year develops through that.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning, everybody. I just wanted to circle back on the Europe question, I think, if my numbers are right, your market -- the DAF share actually ticked down a little bit 2019 versus '18. Is there anything you'd call out there from a regional or country perspective and do you think that that reverses here in 2020? Thanks.","Preston Feight","Yes, so two thoughts to that is, we had 16.2% in the 2019, which was the second best year ever, which is coming off of our 16.6%, you're right, that was up 1 [ph] point and 1.3% [ph] we had huge gain and we've held on to that gain and we have good momentum right now I think. The other part of it is on the medium-duty side, we grew our share from 9% to 9.7% during the course of 2019. So we actually grew there and then I think it's -- I wouldn't try to isolate down from that. The U.K. did really well, but we are performing well in a lot of the markets in Europe and I think the DAF trucks are really performing and helping our customers be successful.","Seth Weber","Okay, thanks. And then just to follow up on, I think you mentioned pricing price-cost was positive in the fourth quarter, anything you'd call out for your thoughts for 2020. Do you expect that to continue?","Preston Feight","I think what we saw was prices were a little bit realized over a little bit over 2% [ph] and costs were less than 2% and we'll watch what happens in 2020 and see how that model develops for us, but there's obviously going to be fluctuations as we go forward?","Seth Weber","Okay. That's all I had. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Hi, thank you. I wanted to pick up on the point about price cost. Is the first quarter, the implied deliveries are down about 17% year-over-year and in that context, I think the 14% gross margin would be viewed as fairly impressive? Price cost you said was positive in the fourth quarter, can you give us some sense the cadence or what do you expect for the first quarter. I think people are just trying to figure out if there is a risk to the top line, what's the decremental on it. In the first quarter, the setup on the guide, again relatively impressive at 14% gross margin with that kind of delivery decline. So can you help us a bit on maybe mix in the backlog, price\/cost in the first quarter. We're just trying to get a sense of the resiliency of that again, relatively impressive decremental in the first quarter?","Preston Feight","I think -- thanks for the question, David. I think when we think about it, it's really about making sure we have the right -- that we are building the right quantity of trucks, which is obviously based on having the right orders and so we have those matched well together. We're not seeing tremendous fluctuations in costs. We're not seeing tremendous fluctuations in price. So the fact that we had a good price realization in the fourth quarter was advantageous to us and we'll see what happens as we get into 2020 and watch what that model looks like?","David Raso","So the price\/cost spread in the first -- in the fourth quarter, you don't expect it to be terribly different in the first or second, I think we were just trying to figure out is that really a mix, price cost benefit to get you to stay at 14% gross margins or is it just structurally with parts and so forth that we can be somewhat comfortable even if we do want to model more conservative top line that the gross margin resiliency is there, I mean that's the kind of spirit of the question.","Preston Feight","Yes, I think if I try to get the spirit of it, it really if you think about prices because the team does a great job of supporting customers and people are willing to pay for our trucks. That's the overarching thing on price to me is that people want PACCAR products because they are the best and then they are willing to buy those products. I think that part of the truck part and other gross margin performance has to do with the strong performance of our parts organization. So that is a -- as truck sales is down, parts mix is up, that's a contributor as well and really just both of those things that keep us performing at the industry leading levels?","David Raso","But it's not necessarily because price\/cost gets notably better in the first quarter as and maybe some thought your costs are down from steel?","Preston Feight","So there's nothing substantial there.","David Raso","All right, appreciate it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Morning, guys. Just back on the FinCo again. I just wanted to understand because it seemed like your pre-tax profit was down and I think Steven asked earlier, just about carrying forward the margin, but was there anything one-time that was impacting margins this quarter or is it just the weaker used values. Are there any impairments or increased depreciation expenses that are really causing that big step-up in the interest in other borrowing expenses?","Preston Feight","Yes, your final statement is characterizing it accurately. What you say is we had record new business volume in 2019, the $5.6 billion that was a contributor to revenue growth and then more volume on the used side was the other contributor to revenues and that was the headwind on the profit side.","Courtney Yakavonis","And I think you mentioned that you're still seeing the double-digit declines in used. Have you seen any stabilization in used values or is it's still wait and see kind of how that market checks out?","Preston Feight","Well, it is a dynamic market. I think that the nice thing is, as I said and it can't be over-stressed, the fact that especially maybe the second or equally the second owners really like our products. So that's helpful to us from the price position compared to the rest of the industry. So that works to keep us at a premium, not just for the first, but the second owner and then I would share your comment that things have stabilized a little bit. We see one way to look at that is that the amount of inventory coming in is equal to the inventory going out. So that's helpful as well. We're not building used inventory and so kind of the state of where it is right now.","Courtney Yakavonis","And then just on the CapEx side, I think your CapEx for the year came in about $100 million below what your guidance had been and you obviously didn't change the CapEx guidance for next year. So just wanted to understand kind of what that discrepancy was and if anything, is proceeding ahead of schedule or any projects got cut?","Preston Feight","No, in fact that's not exactly how we saw it. We saw CapEx was kind of slightly higher than where we'd started and we have a good cash flow or CapEx plan for 2020 as well, which is going to deliver the great products we need. I wonder if you're looking at the cash flow statements more than your CapEx commitments.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Yes, I was looking at the 575 [ph] versus the guidance for $625 million to $675 million but maybe that's the issue.","Preston Feight","I think that's what you're looking at. I think so -- [indiscernible] is the number that we're talking about for 2019.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay, perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then, and then just lastly, I think the comments that your build has remained steady. I just want to make sure that, that means that you really don't anticipate any further production cuts from the build rates that you are at currently?","Preston Feight","I think what we said is we would expect in the first quarter that deliveries will be down 5% to 7% and that's obviously matching the order intake.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Hey guys, how is it going?","Preston Feight","Really good how about for you?","Joel Tiss","Hanging in there. Yes, so I wonder if we could, if you could spend a minute just talking about Latin America, about how the setup is? Kind of what your market share is looking like and how you think you can gain a little bit more share in 2020 and just kind of the setup of the market there?","Preston Feight","Sure, it's been a fantastic journey for us there. We have a great set of dealers really neat products down there. We've got a lot of success with the dealers and the customers. I think the brand reputation for DAF in Brazil has grown tremendously in just a very short period of time. We're looking at our market share growth opportunities as being substantial. We think that the market is relatively stable down there. So Brazil comes in at 75,000, the South American market overall is 100,000 to 110,000. As we noted, we increased our deliveries by 60% last year in South America. So, substantial growth that way. We'll just look forward to continuing growing the truck sales. The parts business is doing really well. We introduced the Financial Services business for customer financing in Brazil last year. So a lot of good activity happening for us in South America.","Joel Tiss","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Felix [ph] with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks for squeezing me in here. I appreciate some of the color on the parts outlook but as for sort of dissecting some of the different buckets within the business, I'm curious if you have an update on the TRP Stores. How many do you plan to add next year and maybe any color on some sort of same-store sales growth number in that existing base of the stores?","Preston Feight","TRP has been a great addition for us in reaching a new customer base. They've done a fantastic job of that. There's 210 stores now that are in operation. So that's growth year-over-year. We'll keep growing the number of stores where they make sense with our dealers all around the world. That's in Europe, it could be in Russia, it could be in South America and North America, all of the above, really. So we'll continue to see the brand grow and perform well and bring new customers to PACCAR.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then just curious to see if you have an update on the margin profile into next year for the parts business. On one hand, you obviously have the aging MX engine population and then the other one the TRP revenue increase. So any color would be appreciated on that?","Preston Feight","I think the margin profile will stay relatively in the same range.","Unidentified Analyst","Oka, like 27%, 28%?","Preston Feight","That kind of range.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Adam Uhlman","Hi guys, good morning, good afternoon. Going back to the MX engine, it looks like you had a pretty strong fourth quarter. I don't know how much of that increase was mix of customers that you're shipping the engine out to, but how are you thinking about your penetration rate for this year?","Preston Feight","So we have a great powertrain offering, obviously the MX engine that's a core of it. We have great relationship with Cummins as well who does a great job of supporting our customers with their powertrain. We did grow our MX engine share to 47% in the fourth quarter for a full year average of 43%. Part of what enabled that is we invested in manufacturing capacity in the course of the year last year. So we have adequate capacity to build as many MXs as we want for the customers and we look forward to seeing that continue to grow as we move through the cycle.","Adam Uhlman","Okay, got you. And then just a clarification, again on the Financial Services revenue, can you tell us how much your used truck sales were up in the quarter?","Preston Feight","I don't have that detail sitting around in front of me, but they did increase. I just don't know the number in front of us.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Matt Elkott","Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I think your heavy-duty percentage tends to be around 85% historically. So first, are you still comfortable with that breakout longer term. And the second part of my question, what was it in the fourth quarter?","Preston Feight","So, I think that that general percent is okay but we have great growth opportunities in the heavy side and the medium side as we look forward to it. So we'll continue to see share develop at PACCAR positively. Take a steady approach to it and been very successful growing share and we'll continue to find that same success. I don't think there'll be much of a shift though and I don't have the exact number, but you can -- your numbers of ratios are about right.","Matt Elkott","Okay. And do you think that you may have picked up some share with the GM strike in the Class 6 to Class 7 categories in the fourth quarter?","Preston Feight","I think we picked up share because we just have great trucks, great people, great dealers.","Matt Elkott","Got it. And then, just one other question that's -- if we take a longer-term view, could you update us on your strategic priorities, anything that's likely to become more of a focus, more of a growth driver, whether it's a specific region or more vertical integration of PACCAR engines or alternative technologies or anything else?","Preston Feight","Well, you hit some of them, right, we're going to keep growing organically. We're going to grow geographically where it makes sense and provides a profit for the corporation and we're going to keep making the prudent investments in technologies that deliver great trucks and powertrains to our customers when they need them. So all of those will be areas that we grow in.","Matt Elkott","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Wertheimer","Yes, hey everybody. My question is, you gave helpful comments on the European market share. Are you willing to sort of talk about your theme of improving straight truck market share, where that's progressing and whether you need that to work to sort of get above a certain threshold. Any update you can give us there?","Preston Feight","It continues to be a focus. We continue to do well with it. We did grow as a percentage there in the straight truck market. That's going to continue to be an area of what we just talked on the prior question is organic growth for us.","Rob Wertheimer","Are you growing both -- well, you have room to grow both tractor and straight truck share in Europe or is there any kind of limit on the tractor side?","Preston Feight","No, there is no limit. I mean, we're the market leader in tractors and we'll continue to be enjoying that and looking for extension of that and growing on the straight truck side as well.","Harrie Schippers","So we have the product in the straight truck side. So if you look at markets where that has been for a long time, the U.K. Netherlands, Belgium, a straight truck market share is about the same as the tractor market share. So we do have the products. It's just a matter of growing that business also in markets like Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay, thank you. And if I can, I don't know if this is an answerable question, but I'll ask it anyway. Just what's your -- in a normal up and down cycle, what's your preferred pacing of production changes given supply chain given ramping et cetera, would you be looking to make adjustments one and two quarters out or two quarters and three quarters out, just, I know you don't try to hold a lot of inventory and not trying to stop the dealers, just a little bit about the rhythm of how you think about production changes?","Preston Feight","Yes, I think we build trucks to order is the essence of it, which is different than the automotive industry. What we do is when we talk to our customers and they need to truck, then we schedule that in and we try to maintain some kind of a visibility whether that's four, eight, 12 weeks and that's how we define our production schedules.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay. No, thank you.","Preston Feight","All right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, good morning. My impression so far and commentary around pricing expectations is that it's more of a wait and see into 2020? What we saw the last time, demand did soften in 2016 is that there was a little bit of pricing pressure and I'm just curious whether you anticipate that we should be looking at something similar just given a little bit softer demand or if you're seeing anything different out there across competitor behavior that would suggest that the pricing can hold up?","Preston Feight","I think if you think of in terms of truck part and other, in the truck side, there will be obviously market dynamics drive differences, but we have a continued strong performance, an increasing percentage of our performance coming from parts and they are doing a great job. So it's a little bit of a balancing factor to it looking back to prior cycles, but no, I don't think you should think that PACCAR's going to do anything except deliver the best margins in the industry.","Joe O'Dea","And then I guess related but a little bit more of a mix type question. Similarly, going back from if we just track 2015 to 2016, the average truck price was down and it was more than just a pure pricing effect. Is there anything to just be aware of with general mix in a softer demand environment and what that means for average unit pricing just given the mix effect.","Preston Feight","I don't really think so. I don't think there's anything in there.","Joe O'Dea","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Hi everyone. Hey, you know, lot of the real smart questions have been asked here, I just want to follow up with one. I think I know the answer to and just a detail, but when you're giving the 5% to 7% down figure. That's sequentially versus 4Q, that's not a year-on-year number. Correct?","Preston Feight","Yes, correct.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, thank you. And then secondly, with the U.S. pulling back a little bit more than Europe, at least in the outlook. How should I think about tax rate or are there any other changes that I would think about to some of the other line items that would occur as a result of that?","Preston Feight","Yes, I don't think -- there is not going be much change in tax rate overall.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, so consistent with where we are this year.","Preston Feight","Yes.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, that's all I have. Thank you very much and congratulations.","Preston Feight","You bet. Have a great day.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew Casey","Hello. Again, thanks for the follow-up. Two questions, one short-term. I know it's a smaller volume market for you, but you have a pretty good share over there. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether you expect the Australian natural disasters to have any tangible impact on 2020 demand?","Preston Feight","Well, first of all, our hearts and prayers go out to the people there and the country that has been affected -- adversely affected to it. No, I don't think in the longest term that it is going to have any impact to us. We'll continue to be the market leader.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thanks. And then separately, longer term, you talked about it at CES and then again in the release today, the battery electric trucks expected to hit the market a year to-year and a half from now. Are you, based on your work with the customers, seeing any potential for acceleration in adoption rates versus what you originally expected or is it pretty much on track?","Preston Feight","I think it's pretty much on track. It has to make commercial sense or be regulated in and we have really good partnerships that we're working with to bring the right trucks to the customers and we will supply them the best trucks, the best alternative powertrain trucks as they need them.","Andrew Casey","Thanks. And then a little bit more detail on that, Preston, you have kind of divergent, I think divergent potential regulations going on between the EPA and CARB maybe that's been closed, but is there potential for a significantly different adoption rate in let's say California and associated states versus the rest of the country?","Preston Feight","There could be. I mean that can happen. It can happen in Europe that way as well. I think from our standpoint, that's not going to material effect how we develop the products. What we're going to do is develop the best technologies with the highest performance and then we will just supply those for the markets they need based upon where the customers are operating.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Preston Feight","We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you, operator.","Operator","This concludes today's PACCAR's earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are: Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; Bob Christensen, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","[Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2013. PACCAR's second quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $4.3 billion, and quarterly net income was $292 million, an after-tax return on revenues of 6.8%. I'm very proud of our 22,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR's second quarter truck results reflect gradually improving industry truck sales in North America compared to the first quarter of this year. In fact, second quarter truck and parts revenues increased by 10% compared to the first quarter.","Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada were 54,000 units in the second quarter this year compared to 45,000 units in the first quarter. Customer truck purchases are focused primarily on replacement vehicles for their fleets. PACCAR delivered 34,800 trucks during the quarter.","In addition, PACCAR generated record parts revenue in the second quarter. PACCAR Financial Services results for both the second quarter and the first half were records. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 210,000 to 230,000 units this year.","Turning to Europe, freight in Germany, as measured by truck miles driven, or the MAUT, continued at levels comparable to last year. DAF truck orders for the second quarter increased by 34% compared to a year ago and were up 19% from the first quarter. Customers, particularly in the U.K., are accelerating purchases of Euro 5 vehicles before the introduction of the Euro 6 emission standards in January 2014. In Europe, the greater than 16-tonne truck market is projected to be in the range of 210,000 to 230,000 units.","Looking forward, PACCAR truck deliveries in the third quarter are expected to be 1% to 2% higher compared to the second quarter. The benefits of a slightly higher daily build rate are offset by the regular annual 2-week factory summer shutdown in Europe. Third quarter gross margins should be similar to the second quarter.","There are a number of encouraging macroeconomic data points in North America that should benefit truck demand. First, construction activity is picking up, specifically, the housing sector. Housing starts in the U.S. are projected to be approximately 1 million units this year. Second, North American auto production is expected to be 15 million vehicles this year. And third, freight tonnage in the U.S. is at a seasonally adjusted record level, beating the previous record set in December of 2011. These economic improvements have enabled many dealers and customers to generate strong results.","PACCAR Parts business had record quarterly revenues of $709 million, an increase of 6% compared to $666 million in the prior year. Parts quarterly pretax income was $109 million, an increase of 21% compared to $90 million earned in the second quarter last year. The excellent results were driven by record freight tonnage and improved fleet utilization.","PACCAR's capital spending this year is estimated to be $425 million to $475 million, and research and development expenses are estimated to be $250 million to $275 million. PACCAR has continued its new product introductions by launching new vocational and distribution trucks. We're very excited about the DAF CF Euro 6, which will be in production in the third quarter this year, and the Kenworth T880, the Peterbilt Model 567 and the DAF LF Euro 6 will go into production in the fourth quarter of this year. PACCAR, as you know, has the most modern vehicle range in the industry, and our dealers and our customers appreciate it.","PACCAR has expanded its range of proprietary engines with the introduction of the updated PACCAR MX-13 and the new PACCAR MX-11 engine. The PACCAR MX-11 engine will begin production at DAF in the fourth quarter of this year and is planned to be available in Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles in 2015. These new engines will benefit our customers with their excellent fuel efficiency and operating performance.","I hope you all noted the wonderful picture of our new DAF factory under construction at Ponta Grossa, Brazil. We are right on schedule, and will begin production of DAF Trucks in Brazil for the South American market in the fourth quarter of this year. Exciting program.","PACCAR Financial Services revenue were $289 million in the second quarter compared to $266 million in the second quarter last year. PACCAR Financial's second quarter pretax income was $82 million compared to $77 million earned last year. This is the best pretax profit quarter in PACCAR Financial history. Great job. The excellent results benefited from growth in portfolio balances.","In summary, PACCAR is enhancing its leadership position in the global truck market by launching the highest-quality products and services in the industry, and by continuing to invest in new geographic regions. Thank you. I'd be happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs & Co.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on the dealer development efforts in Brazil, just in more context if you don't mind. How many dealer groups do you have signed at this point? And how many dealer locations do you expect to have by the end of next year? And then, excellent SG&A control in the quarter. I'm wondering, to what extent should we expect that to move higher as you continue to build out the network in Brazil?","Mark C. Pigott","Absolutely. That's an important part of the foundation that we're setting in Brazil. Right now we have 12 dealer groups and they will have approximately 25 dealer locations complete by the end of this year. Over time, we'll have 100 dealer locations throughout the country. We're very pleased with the quality of our dealer groups in Brazil. Every one of our dealer signees in Brazil, we take over to Europe for an extended period of time so that they can see, firsthand, the DAF factory. They can talk with the current existing DAF dealers in Europe and get a real appreciation for the quality standards and the customer service that we expect. So the construction's ongoing right now throughout the country, and it'll be a very exciting and important plank to support our customers as we grow in Brazil.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in Europe, Mark, we've seen some pretty good pickup in replacement tire volumes. Looks like your Parts business really saw an acceleration in the quarter. I'm wondering if you could just step us through how you're thinking about the market developments at this point, how much of the new truck demand that you're seeing, do you think, is prebuy versus recovery and -- are aligned demand off a low base? I appreciate that might be tough to break out the 2, but would love your broader thoughts.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, looking at the prebuy, which right now is focused primarily in the U.K., I think U.K. and 1 or 2 other countries have defined what the program is for our customers or our dealers in terms of when they can buy, when they can sell Euro 5 vehicle. I'd say, if I had to put a number on it, probably 3% to 5% benefit in terms of number of units that we're looking at. And that's probably comparable to what our competitors are seeing also. Although, since we're the market share leader in the U.K., it might be a little bit more of a benefit for us.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, you've had a pretty big new product development push out over the past couple of years. I'm wondering how you would guide us to think about your R&D and CapEx plans over '14, '15, '16 timeframe compared to what we're seeing this year.","Mark C. Pigott","We have had a wonderful 18 months of introductions with the finest products I've ever seen and great engines. I'd say, we'll see slightly lower investments, but in this very exciting and challenging competitive world, I think even in the truck industry, you're seeing an acceleration in terms of midlife model introductions. And obviously, the engineering teams are already excited about working on new models. There's always new regulations in terms of the engine development. So you might see something slightly lower, but not too much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow-up again on overseas or Europe. I mean, because you mentioned, I think, in this quarter that orders for DAF were up 34% year-over-year, I think it was up 19% sequentially in the first quarter too, I think DAF was up, I don't know, 30% or something like that. So I'm just trying to understand the disconnect between the order trends and I guess, what we're seeing in the sales in Europe specifically and just, at what point do we see that translate on the sales side? And then just, my other question is, can you give us an update on what you're seeing in the overall pricing environment with one of your peers back in the market?","Mark C. Pigott","Good question. On the DAF sales and DAF production, when we look back at last year, it was at lower levels, obviously. We're seeing DAF has done a really remarkable job of maintaining a very consistent build rate for 18 months, and growing business outside of Europe and maintaining their share inside of Europe. Right now, we're seeing a pretty strong growth in the U.K. because of the prebuy, and DAF will increase its production towards the end of this quarter. I think we'll probably see some of our competitors doing the same thing. Obviously, we'll have to see how that translates into next year. We're still waiting for Germany to outline their Euro 5, Euro 6 transition program. But all in all, I think DAF has done a very good job. In terms of pricing, I think there's slight improvement in pricing. I think as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our dealers and our customers are doing well. There's record freight levels out there. Obviously, still looking to attract drivers. Fuel has been reasonably consistent. They're getting the benefits of improved efficiency out of our new vehicles. Right now, talking with many customers, they're primarily focused on replacement. But there's still -- there's a few that are starting to talk about growing their fleets, which would be good -- I'm talking North America now. In terms of any of our competitors, there's -- we enjoy the competitive environment and people come and go, and we're just consistent doing our job every day.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm sorry, Mark, just 2 follow-up questions on the -- I appreciate your color on production, that was very helpful. Just -- you said production up 1% to 2%, an improvement, sequentially, can you just break out what Europe is versus U.S.? And then, did you get any material cost benefit in the quarter? I'll get back in queue after that.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, sure. I think the benefit would be a little bit more in Europe than in North America. North America is probably comparable in Europe because of the prebuys, it's a little bit up. And in terms of material there, obviously, has been a lot of discussion in the international press about material costs going down. So we see some benefit, but the vast majority of our relationships with our vendors, our long-term contracts and I think it's a little bit of ebbs and flows. So slightly beneficial, but not really noteworthy. Thank you. Good questions, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was -- I was kind of struck by your margins in the quarter, which were, I think, a little better than in terms of...","Mark C. Pigott","In a good way?","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, in a good way. They were, I think, a little better than the flattish kind of guidance we talked about a month ago. And I'm wondering what you think might have driven the upside there, whether it might be, I don't know, mix or pricing or whatever you think might have contributed to that?","Mark C. Pigott","I think the -- we have a pretty long, established program of driving efficiency improvements every year, regardless of the competitive and economic landscape. I think the people in the production side, because of the slightly higher build rates, have been able to get some of that, let's call it, production efficiency, which translates into slightly better margins. Maybe a little bit of it, also, is because of the new products that we've been able to launch and enthusiastically received by our customers. I think that would be 2 main elements for improvement.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And the new products would be the trucks and the engine both?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. It's a complete package now. I mean, that's -- kind of, when we look at our vehicles, we look at it with the PACCAR engine and say, all-new family of engines, all-new family of trucks.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So is it reasonable to expect that penetration of those new products to continue to grow as we go forward over the next several quarters?","Mark C. Pigott","That is certainly -- the plan here is to continue to grow both the engines and the new products. And we're in good shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mark, I'm interested in your perspective on the backdrop -- from a fundamental standpoint, you've seen quite upbeat with activity up, and automotive production up, freight tonne -- tonnage at record level. And yet, we've had a couple of months of weakish, maybe slightly disappointing, truck orders. I'm wondering if you can reconcile that for us or what you think is going on? Was it just a step-back by fleets, as hours of service got implemented or diesel prices rising, or do you have any explanation for why we might have seen that slowdown?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, yes. I mean, there was -- it was a slower month in June, but -- and we modified our industry forecast, which I think you noted, Ann, both for Europe and North America. But I think there's getting to be some fundamental improvement throughout our industry. I guess, we've seen many, many of our dealers and they're in very good position, they have relatively low inventory. They've got a good population of trucks. The parts and service business is good. There's really an excellent utilization by fleets. Fleets are making reasonable money, some are making record results. So the general economy in North America, let's say, it's growing 2-ish percent; flat to down, depending on what country you're looking at in Europe. And in North America, I think people are saying, \"These vehicles are getting old now, not only age but also in terms of miles.\" And they're excited by the benefits they see on our new vehicles. So I think it's -- the foundation is getting strengthened, and I think it will translate into improved sales over time.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, a follow-up on natural gas. I was at the Alternative Fuels Conference there, a couple of weeks ago, and there was huge excitement around the 12-liter natural gas offering by Cummins Westport. Does that engine -- because both Kenworth and Peterbilt are going to offer that engine, does that cannibalize your own MX engine, your own 13-liter?","Mark C. Pigott","No. Of course, we are very strong partner with Cummins around the world and we're very pleased -- and I think you probably ran into some of our team there at the conference. I think we had a lot of people there. It's a little hard to get exact market share data, but we figure we're -- 30% to 40% of the natural gas industry is taking Kenworth or Peterbilt vehicles. We feel very good about that. It's still, Ann, 1% of the total industry sales. But if it improves, whether it's because of the differential between natural gas and diesel or as the infrastructure starts to get built out, I think we're in excellent position to continue to ramp up our business within the industry. So it's an exciting element. It probably gets a lot more press because it's a very topical item right now. Other parts of the business that only are 1% to 2% of the industry don't get anywhere near that press, but we are pleased to be a strong performer in that area.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I appreciate, but there does seem to be a lot of interest in the 12-liter, maybe not the 15-liter.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the 12-liter, it's a very good engine and I think it's -- it has really very little impact on our product offering. It's a nice addition.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Crawford from UBS.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just following up on some earlier questions on Brazil. Have -- how have developments there, economically, politically, shaped your view as you prepare to enter that market? Are you seeing a need to fine-tune your marketing or financing or dealer support?","Robert J. Christensen","This is Bob Christensen. We really don't see any of the near-term impacts that you read in the press impacting our long-term direction to participate in the market. We see that the fundamentals in Brazil remain strong from a long term point of view and PACCAR intends to be there for a very, very long time. We'll start slow but ramp up over the next 5 to 50 years.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, just briefly, could you provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of the vocational market and how that trended through the quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","We're seeing some improvement in the vocational market, and as I mentioned, we're launching a new Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF vocational vehicles now until the end of the year to take advantage of that. So we're excited about it. Obviously, the housing industry and the car production uses a lot of, let's call it, vocational vehicles. So that's continuing to be a strong point for us. In Europe, of course, car production is at about a 20-year low, so we're not seeing quite the benefit there. But in North America, it's a good, consistent performer for us. And we have brand-new vehicles, which the customers and dealers are looking forward to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick ones and then, a broad question. The first one, on your answer to a prior European prebuy impact, the 3% to 5%, was that on industry sales or on your orders?","Mark C. Pigott","Let's say it's on industry sales. It's a little hard number to get, but let's use that as an estimate.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, on your orders, do you think it was all impacted by that or is it more related to the stability and people are starting to replace again?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we have an underlying improvement in the orders we're getting, and there is some, let's call it, benefit from a prebuy. Primarily, in the U.K., we have about 30% share in the U.K. overall. And the U.K. is still 1 of the top 5 truck markets in all of Europe. So there's some benefit there. But it's just a couple of percent.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, one last quick one. The new segment reporting format, could you help us understand, is there any seasonality in Parts, Q3 versus Q2? Or is it pretty consistent depending on what the trucking activity is?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. No, not really any seasonality. We've got a very talented Parts organization that works very hard to not have seasonality. They only have programs tailored for each part of the year. And of course, they're also doing a great job of driving into new markets such as regional transportation, buses and after, let's call it, all-makes vehicles. So there's -- they're a very creative group and have set up very good programs, and working directly with fleet customers. And our dealers continue to generate very solid earnings for the company.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, stepping back from the quarter a little bit, a broad question on the U.S. Class 8 market. Your customers are facing a couple different regulatory headwinds, one on -- as you've talked about in the past, the capital cost part of their cost structure and then, operating expense with some of the driver regulations. Do you view that as somewhat causing a hesitation, or is it kind of a more, more of a long-term dampener on industry volumes?","Mark C. Pigott","I think the -- the customers -- and of course, they just -- one of the industry publications just published the top 100 fleets in North America in the last week or so, it makes good reading to see the strength. But the customers have been through a challenging time over the last dozen years. A few tough recessions in there for our industry. So the -- the customers that are operating today, I really give them a lot of credit. They're very smart. They analyze their business. They take a look at their capital expenditures, obviously, they're dealing with a whole host of regulations, hours of service, cost of new vehicles, a changing customer base for themselves. So when we had 300 -- over 300,000 units back in '07 and '08, there was a strong GDP growth throughout all of North America that's dampened down to -- I think the customers, in some ways, are even better now. They're at higher utilization. Obviously, they're continuing to work on attracting drivers. I think they're actually doing pretty well. A lot of them are generating record profit results and I think as a number of the analysts pointed out, it's still a very up-and-down economy in general. And so I give our customers a lot of credit for navigating through the challenges. As the general economy improves, which we're starting to see some of the -- some of the benefits of, I think truck sales will improve because it is a fairly old fleet out there and the new products that, certainly, we're introducing and have introduced will directly benefit their bottom line. So we're encouraged by it. We're pleased by the strength of the dealer and customer body out there and it should be an exciting couple of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a few questions, just back to the Parts business. I mean, obviously, you saw a big pickup in margins year-on-year, and I -- just hoping beyond normal seasonality, can you talk about the sustainability there? And if you see an acceleration of replacement cycle, do you think we will be on an upward trajectory for parts margins in the coming year or is it kind of the goal to sort of sustain where you are now?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think in terms of parts margin, we look at it as sort of comparable. We always have new programs introducing and retiring older programs and of course, all these wonderful new trucks that we've introduced don't really generate much parts business for the first couple of years. So I think margins will be comparable.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the international markets about Russia, Australia, the Andean region?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. For Russia, the Russian market continues to be solid. It's comparable level to last year and DAF continues to grow their presence. They've gone from 2 dealers to nearly 20 dealers and then, plan to add additional dealer locations in the coming years. Last year's deliveries were in the 2,700 level and expect to increase that further this year. So Russia is an exciting opportunity for DAF as they continue to build their business there. As we look at Australia, Australia is a strong market for PACCAR, always has been a market leader there. Australia is a reasonably good economy, and some of the challenges, currently, with some of the minerals, but long-term outlook for Australia in our business, is very positive.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And in Colombia, what were you seeing there? You were seeing some slowdown earlier in the year, last several quarters?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think the Colombian slowdown, we've -- we talked about that I think previously, continues to be subdued. I think we -- again, we have a strong presence in that market, we're the market leader with the Kenworth brand in that market, and we see good long-term opportunities to kind of -- to grow that business as the demand recovers.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, just lastly, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the order trends you're seeing in North America amongst the larger fleets versus owner\/operators and where you think we are in terms of age of fleet amongst the different classes of buyers?","Mark C. Pigott","Of course, many of the \"owner\/operators\" have really aligned themselves with medium and large fleets, but although they may continue to operate under their own colors, if you will, I think the age is still in that sort of 7-plus year average. And orders have been pretty, pretty steady for the last couple of months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, can we go back to Germany for a second? You mentioned that they're still sort of deciding what they're going to do, prebuy, no prebuy. I mean, is this kind of what you guys thought Germany would be like, that they'd make their decision sort of late summer and fall, and then, you could see a pickup there in that country? Or are they making -- maybe taking a little bit longer than you thought to sort of decide what to do?","Mark C. Pigott","I -- when we were at the Hannover show last year, the German officials commented that they would be coming out with their plans in the September timeframe this year. So I think they're following their -- what they said their plan was going to be.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And that's helpful. And then, going back to vocational, you've talked about vocational being higher-margin. Has that also helped mix -- I think I remember, Mark, from a previous call, that you said it wouldn't really help mix this year, but has it, did it have some impact in 2Q?","Mark C. Pigott","No, but we're starting to see some better orders coming out of the -- let's call it the construction segment. Obviously, the residential home construction gets a lot of positive press. You don't really see too much on the commercial construction side at this time. In fact, I think a number of large, international companies that do, let's call it, commercial construction, are sort of adjusting their forecast. But on the residential, I've seen some benefits there.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, just one other quickie, like one of the previous questions was around sort of the other markets. And one thing that we see, Mark, is a pretty decent inflection this quarter. And it's been going down for -- the other segment has been going down for the last few quarters. You've talked about Colombia. Our -- or did one of these markets materially pick up sequentially or is there some seasonality to the other business that we should know about?","Mark C. Pigott","No, not that -- you're talking specifically about the...","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Other countries, so like Mexico...","Robert J. Christensen","Yes, we had a very nice second quarter in Mexico that offset some of the softness in Colombia.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I liked your comments on efficiency of customers, and I was just kind of curious if the -- if there -- if what they have said to you regarding hours of service requirements has maybe changed attitude toward buying or capital needs, if you could comment on that?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it -- it's a good question that way, I'm not sure that -- let's call it, one regulatory law introduction will sort of trigger a buy, no-buy decision amongst these fleets. These are very thoughtful, insightful customers who, of course, they recognize what regulatory actions will increase or decrease their cost of doing their business. I think it's really more in the aggregate that -- how do they remain competitive, how do they take care of their end customer, the benefits they see from our new products and the new products we've introduced or about 30% of our current production now. So that's going very, very well. It's just -- it's a myriad of different inputs that the customers have to decipher in order to make that purchase, no-purchase decision. But I think they're -- say, they're generating good results and if we get a few more elements of the economy starting to improve, it could be good for the truck industry.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So a little bit of a nuance, but certainly, the macroeconomic drivers are bigger?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that's very well put.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then I had -- maybe you could comment on kind of general trends in your credit quality, seems like Financial Services have done pretty well.","Mark C. Pigott","You bet.","Robert J. Christensen","Yes, the financial services business continues -- the portfolio continue to perform very well for -- at the end of the quarter, our over 30-day past dues were 70 basis points. And so credit losses are relatively low and obviously, generating record profits was a big... recognition of the efforts that our teams put together in the Financial Services segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So real quick, the deliveries were up 14% in the quarter sequentially. I think your guidance was 5% to 10%. Can you just talk about where things were a little bit better than you might have expected?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Well, I think the -- most of it was in North America. The short answer to that one. Guys just did a very good job of not only continuing with our vehicles that we've had in production for a couple of years, but also incorporating and launching the new vehicles and updating the factories and continuing to improve the efficiencies. So they, the production and engineering material team, did an outstanding job.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess in Europe, on the -- barring any changes for other countries or whatnot, would you expect the prebuy to basically peak here in the third quarter, then?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it depends on the country, as we mentioned. I think Belgium, the Netherlands and the U.K. have pretty defined prebuy transition plans. So the orders come in, but we'll be building them in the third and the fourth quarter.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But the orders should peak in the third quarter then?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, you would think so, but depending on the country's guidelines, there may be customers who are waiting -- and I think we talked a little bit about the guidance from Germany. If that comes in September, I mean, you're going to be placing your orders in the fourth quarter.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. Understood. Okay. And I guess, on the first quarter call, I think you mentioned that some of the weakness in the Parts business in the first quarter was related to Europe. So should we interpret that the strength here in the second quarter reflects a recovery in the European Parts business?","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think it's pretty much strong all over. Maybe a little bit more for North America than Europe. I think Europe reflects just a little bit more of a challenging economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Mark, I think you mentioned the mix of the T680 and the 579 was 30%, I don't know if I heard that right, of production. Is that still higher in the order book and how high do you think that could get?","Mark C. Pigott","It is a little higher than the order book and obviously, the teams are working hard to continue to grow that. Coming -- in the last 12 months, it's been right on target and we're very pleased.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, and it was production, then, the 30% you mentioned?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that's right.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then, I know it's been parsed over and over, but in Europe, your orders did pick up, you didn't take the industry forecast up. Did you think that you were gaining more share than you had expected or is this just a little bit of a lumpiness when the prebuy comes for you?","Mark C. Pigott","I think part of it is the prebuy. We're maintaining our share comparable to last year, still have half a year to go to see how the share translates. But people really enjoy and benefit from the DAF vehicles and I think we're certainly getting the benefit out of the U.K. market at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering, can you talk about dealer inventory levels both in Europe and in North America? Do you think you have enough inventory to meet any projected prebuy incremental demand out of Germany for the fourth quarter? And in the U.S., do you have enough inventory on the dealers lots for improving vocational demand?","Mark C. Pigott","Of course, it's always -- inventory levels, always, are probably looked at a little bit differently between the OEM and the dealer. I think our dealer inventory levels in North America are at a lower level. I think our dealers probably think that's a good thing. But certainly, we think the inventory levels could be a little bit -- a little bit higher, but we're certainly meeting our customer demand. In Europe, slightly different economic outlook. As we get into the prebuy, orders are moving through the dealers very quickly and right into the customers hands. So I think the dealer inventory level in Europe is -- it's satisfactory.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Got it. Could you also talk about what you're seeing, in general, for leasing trends in North America? Or where do we stand in terms of your own unit deliveries, and has that changed much?","Mark C. Pigott","For leasing? Yes, I'd say, it's pretty consistent with levels that we saw in the prior year, probably up slightly. PacLease continues to add additional locations throughout their system, which is very beneficial, as more and more customers look to have nationwide or support for their vehicles as they cross the country. So leasing is strong and continue to make a good contribution to the Financial Services segment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So I just, basically, have one question. There are a couple of other people who alluded to this, but basically, it's this disconnect, seeming disconnect between the production forecast and it's not just you guys. I mean, there's a number of different folks who are out there projecting an increase in production, an increase in orders in the back half. And then, you referenced here this recent publication with the Top 100, that same publication is talking about surveying fleets and how they're not excited about buying new trucks or are less excited about buying new trucks than they were this time last year. So it seems like there's this potential disconnect. At some point, something has to give, either inventory builds up and it ends up being a pressure on the entire industry or end market demand picks up and everything is wine and roses. I'm just wondering, which of those 2 scenarios you think is likely to play out? If you could just kind of talk through what the puts and takes are there?","Mark C. Pigott","I don't think it's either of those scenarios, actually. As I say, our inventories are in excellent shape. Of course, we build to order. So we get an order in for a dealer who, typically, has a customer in mind and we build it. So we flex our production levels that way. In Europe, we're seeing increased orders coming in, as I had mentioned, some of it is related to a prebuy, primarily in the U.K. We may see some of that in Germany as we get into the fourth quarter. So the inventory levels for our dealers in Europe are at satisfactory levels. So I think that's a very normal business. Yes, you're correct. Obviously, we not only read that article, I alluded to it. But of course, we know all of those customers. I think if you look a little closer at that article, it will say that many of those fleets are looking to increase the number that they're ordering compared to a year ago. But be that as it may, in North America, we're looking at comparable production in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. So I think -- I think it's all in balance. It should be pretty much business is normal. We find that the benefit, of course, is all these wonderful, new products we've launched and the benefit that will bring to our customers. So I think it's -- it's very much in balance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I want to dig through the Parts business a little. Very strong performance there versus what we saw in the first quarter. It seems like it's stronger than just what utilization would be. We hear you talking about the truckers, it sounds like there's a little bit of a weakness on the freight side in Q2, but you had a pretty strong Parts business. Can help explain that a little?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think the Parts business in the first quarter was good also. I think we have to understand that there was -- it's gone from strength to strength, is the way we look at it. And I think as we -- we just begin to break out this segment, so I think obviously, a lot of new information. But Parts has always been a very solid contributor to the growth of PACCAR since the beginning of our company, and we've got the largest population of vehicles. We have Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF over 1.5 million vehicles running around the world. We have the most extensive and strongest dealer network, I'd say, in the industry, and we continue to add dealers every year. We've got a lot more fleet-defined programs in Parts, whether it's the way we do centralized billing to the way we have all-makes parts. So there's a lot of very good and focused programs that are contributing to the growth of Parts. Not every quarter has such strong growth, but over the long term, we look for steady growth out of Parts.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Are you at the point where the Parts revenue stream from the MX engine is starting to be part of the driver?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no, not at this time. It's a -- that'll be off in the future.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Another couple of years there, probably?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, probably. Maybe.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then, one last item here on the Euro prebuy. I want to ask the question, a little bit different way. As we go through that in these 3 countries and potentially, Germany, in most of these regions where we've had prebuy that first quarter afterwards, things fall off pretty dramatically. What are your thoughts about that in early '14?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it just depends on what type of derogation guidelines are implemented by country. Some countries may allow a certain percent of your production in the previous year to be built in the following year. Also of course, the biggest driver for our whole industry is the economic development within the Eurozone. So if you got some insight into that, I'm sure there'll be quite a few people interested in it. So obviously DAF, as with Kenworth and Peterbilt, are also committed to continuing to grow their business. And so I think -- there might be some adjustment in the first quarter, but easily work through it. We've seen, gosh, what have we seen? Four of these in the last 12 years, so you work through it and move on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I got to be honest, my questions at this point have been asked and answered. So let me just throw a small one at you. The improvement in gross margin, I apologize if you hit this, I got on the call about 5 minutes late. How much of that is a mix issue in the manufacturing business with the Parts business being better, and how much of that is your raw material costs are actually down and lower?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Good question.","Robert J. Christensen","There's really 3 parts to it. There's obviously, a little bit of a volume impact, some factory absorption that's been to our benefit, a slight improvement in material cost and then, there's a mix impact associated with our Parts business as well. That, more or less, accounts for it.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And how would you split up the improvement between the 3?","Robert J. Christensen","Oh, I'd say, they're probably all about the same.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3.

Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ken, and good morning. Thanks to PACCAR's 23,000 employees around the world, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company with many records established. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $19.1 billion and record net income of $1.6 billion and after-tax return on revenues of 8.4%. Net income increased 18% versus the prior year.","2015 was PACCAR's 77th consecutive year of earning a net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North American heavy-truck market since 2006, and the highest European heavy-truck market since 2008. In addition, PACCAR Parts earned record pre-tax income and PACCAR Financial Services achieved another strong profit year. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones in our 110th anniversary year.","This included the delivery of DAF's 1 millionth truck, the production of the 100,000 engine in our Mississippi engine factory, and 35th anniversary celebrations at Peterbilt's Denton, Texas factory, and at PACCAR leasing. During the year, PACCAR continued investing in premium quality products and services in our core markets, and expanding our presence in emerging markets to provide the foundation for future growth.","PACCAR's fourth quarter sales in Financial Services revenues were $4.4 billion and quarterly net income was $347 million, a strong 8.8% after-tax return on revenues. During the quarter, European truck deliveries increased, partially offsetting reduced North American truck deliveries. The strong contribution of all company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry.","PACCAR declared cash dividends of $2.30 per share last year, a 25% increase compared to 2014 and the highest total dividend in company history. The regular quarterly dividend was raised by 9% during the year. PACCAR's total dividends in 2015 provided a yield of over 4%, which is in the top 100 companies in the S&P 500.","During 2015, PACCAR repurchased 3.8 million shares of its stock for $202 million.

Vehicle deliveries and truck and other margins in the first quarter this year are projected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a good market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada heavy-duty truck market in 2015.","Class 8 truck industry retail sales totaled 278,000 units for the year. Peterbilt and Kenworth also achieved a record 17.4% share of the U.S. and Canadian medium-duty truck market last year, resulting in a record 27,300 medium-duty truck deliveries for PACCAR.","2016 will be another good year for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck market with retail sales estimated to be in a range of 230,000 units to 260,000 units. Additional good news is that Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer inventories are in great shape entering this year. DAF increased its market share to 14.6% in the European above 16-tonne truck market last year, compared to 13.8% in 2014. The market was a strong 269,000 units in 2015.","Looking at this year, we anticipate that the European above 16-tonne truck market has the potential to expand further and be in a range of 260,000 vehicles to 290,000 vehicles. Economic growth in Europe is expected to increase this year to 1.7% with more than 2% growth anticipated in the UK, DAF's largest market.","PACCAR Parts generated record pre-tax profit of $556 million and strong revenues of $3.1 billion in 2015.","The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. During the year, PACCAR Parts set records for parts deliveries to fleets, online part sales, and TRP part sales for all makes of trucks and trailers.","For the fourth quarter, PACCAR Parts achieved revenues of $750 million and pre-tax income of $126 million. Our expectation for 2016 is that parts and revenues \u2013 is that parts revenues, excluding the effects of currency movements, could increase 3% to 5%.","PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $293 million in the fourth quarter, and pre-tax income was $90 million. The good results benefited from continuing strong portfolio performance. PACCAR leasing end of the year was a record 39,000 units in its full-service leased portfolio. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned pre-tax income of $363 million.","At this point, I'm going to have Michael Barkley address the effects of currency movements on our segment operations.","Michael T. Barkley - Vice President & Controller","For the truck segment, the quarter-over-quarter comparison has us \u2013 the impact of currency was $200 million on revenue, and for the full-year, the impact was $940 million on revenue. The profit impact was minimal given that we have a large amount of material coming for engines into our Columbus engine factory from the eurozone. For parts, the quarterly impact on revenue was $38 million, and for the full year was $193 million. The impact on profit was $4 million for the quarter and $34 million for the full year.","For Financial Services, the impact on revenue was $17 million and the impact for the full year was $79 million. And the impact on profit for Financial Services was $5 million for the quarter and for the full year was $22 million.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Michael.","As we look at next year, PACCAR's projected research and development spending of $240 million to $270 million and capital expenditures of $325 million to $375 million will expand Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF product offerings, enhance the PACCAR engine range, and increase the capacity and operating efficiency of our factories and distribution centers.","As the company begins its 111th year, we are in an excellent position to lead the industry with the highest quality products and services.","Thank you, and I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citi.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks. Good morning, Ron.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Tim.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just on the first one, maybe you could extend, I think you had mentioned the margins, 1Q being comparable to 4Q based on the way things look today. Can you extend that to your expectations for the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that as we think about margins for the year, I think that we see the full year being barely comparable to 2015.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, got it. And then just on the market share trend in Europe, obviously, how the individual countries play out can influence that quite a bit. Just in terms of some of your key markets, what are you thinking in terms of how you're planning for that expectation of just overall share? I know that's not easy to forecast at this time of year, but I guess just based of your gains, can you continue to gain further share for DAF across Western Europe?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","DAF has a really long history of continuing to grow their share progressively over the long term, and that would continue to be our target with the investments that we made and the great new Euro VI products that they have in the marketplace, the continuing enhancements that we make to the PACCAR engines. We've got a great product lineup. We have great service capability with PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial. So our anticipation is that we'll continue to increment that market share on our way to our medium-term target of 20%.","Tim W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right, thanks a lot.","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on inventory, I guess, broadly in the channel. You mentioned during your prepared remarks that you think Peterbilt and Kenworth are in good shape when it comes to retail inventory. I was just wondering if you guys think that PACCAR was maybe more nimble than some of your competitors when it comes to responding to the recent downturn in orders because obviously a lot of folks have been talking about the buildup of inventory out there in the channel? So if you guys have I guess low inventory, that would imply that most of the inventory concerns are being felt by other truck companies. Is that accurate?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I can't really comment on the nimbleness of our competitors, but I know that we monitor our business very closely and manage it to balance the delivery of trucks with the demand that's in the market. I would say that based on what we know we have 45 \u2013 50 days worth of inventory in the channel. I think the industry is closer to a 90-day measure. So as I said, we are really in great shape in terms of where we're at starting the 2016 year.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, very good. That's good to hear. I was wondering, I guess, also if you could maybe make a couple comments here on pricing. Obviously, if you look at just pure truck revenue and divide it by the number of units sold, it looks like there was a pretty material degradation in sequential terms. But obviously, you've got some ForEx in there. You've got presumably some mix maybe toward medium-duty. I was just wondering if you could maybe help us interpret that sequential decline and how much is, I guess, \"real pricing\".","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, the margin performance for the quarter and the year were excellent. We expect that, as we've mentioned, margins in the first quarter to be comparable to what we saw in the fourth quarter. Almost all of the per unit degradation is exchange-related. So that's just the effects of translating currencies around the world into the U.S. dollar.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay, very good. Thanks a lot, guys.","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Steven.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of used truck pricing and how that's influencing your forecast of demand for 2016 on new sales at this point. I think last quarter, it sounded like it wasn't much of an issue, but wondering if anything has really changed there.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think what we're seeing is there are more used trucks coming into the market, and that's dampening used truck prices a bit. But the great news is that the Kenworth and Peterbilt products continue to earn a premium relative to the competition. And so we're very involved with selling used trucks last year. As a company, we sold about 9,000 trucks globally, and we'll do that again this year. So we'll use that as a tool to be able to support new truck business and our finance operations.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I think the margins have favored North America over Europe based on volumes and Euro VI program over the last year or so. Do you anticipate that in 2016 the margins kind of in balance again between the two regions at this point?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We think the margin \u2013 as we said, we expect it to be comparable to last year, and I think that would \u2013 on a market basis, I think that would be true as well.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So still, in other words, favoring North America over Europe sounds like then?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Morgan Stanley.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Ron, my first question is around your 1Q production outlook. I know you guys had flattish Q-on-Q, but what are the thoughts on U.S. and Canada versus Europe? Do you also expect like a flattish outcome for both of the regions?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that North America is going to be up in the 10% to 15% range, and Europe would be down in that range just because of workdays and production, beta (15:57) production levels in each of the markets.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, Ron.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then my second question is just what have you guys seen or heard from U.S. customers with respect to the MX-11 launch so far?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's just \u2013 we're just getting those into the field. The customers who have had the test trucks that have been running in the market \u2013 we have hundreds of thousands of test miles on those trucks, and the feedback from those customers has been excellent. So, the MX-11 has been in the European market now for two years, with great responses now, 25% of the production in our European operations. So, we're excited to offer that and think that'll be a nice enhancement to meet customer needs both in the vocational and regional haul applications.","Nicole Deblase - Morgan Stanley & Co.

Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ron, I wonder if you could talk about your bookings in Europe in the quarter. Did your lead times widen out? It sounds like you're taking the build rate higher, if I'm not mistaken, in the first quarter, given the number of working days. Is that right? Can you just flush out for us what you're seeing in that market, please?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Can you rephrase your question, Jerry?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure. So, can you talk about whether your lead times extended in the fourth quarter? It looks like in Europe, it looks like your build rates are moving higher. So I would guess your book-to-bill in the fourth quarter was greater than 1. But I'd appreciate any color there.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Order intake during the course of last year really outpaced the build rate in the first parts of the year. And so we were ramping up build rate, and build rates as we start 2016 are comparable to where we ended up last year with fewer work days and just a slight reduction in the average daily count for the first quarter. So it's \u2013 lead times are in excellent shape, really, in all of our markets as we begin 2016.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then obviously, we'll get the details when the 10-K comes out. But I'm wondering if you could just help us bridge the year-over-year gross margin performance for fourth quarter 2015 versus fourth quarter 2014 in terms of the contribution of pricing, net of material cost. Any piece that you could help us with would be helpful.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's a lot of moving pieces in there, Jerry, with pricing cost movement, customer mix, model mix, et cetera. So that's \u2013 we really don't have that level of granularity here.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then in terms of the 2016 outlook, for the full-year, you mentioned you're looking for comparable gross margins even though shipments, I think, are expected to be down based on your outlook for North America and European truck markets. Can you talk about what's favorable at the gross margin line that's providing that tailwind despite lower volumes?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our teams are just doing a great job of rigorously managing the cost structure. We, obviously, work very closely with our suppliers to make sure that we're getting our fair share of commodity cost movements. We have great products. The Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF products are the highest quality and demand premium price in the market. So, as we look at this year, we feel that 2016 will be comparable to our 2015 levels.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right, thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon here.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can we talk about your Parts business a little bit? It came in weaker on revenues and significantly weaker on EBIT margins than I was forecasting. Now I don't know if I was just setting too high an expectation. Can you just talk about Parts in Q4 and what went on there, did I miss something from a seasonality perspective?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think as we look at Parts \u2013 Michael talked about the exchange rate effects and so when you compare the fourth quarter results with the fourth quarter the prior year, they're essentially the same as last year, very strong fourth quarter last year. There were fewer new trucks being delivered as well as I think a little bit of rebalancing of inventories in the market, but as we commented, we think Parts will continue to grow as we enter into 2016.","Our Parts team has done a great job with some of the many programs that they've put in place. And we continue to see, obviously, growth in the engine parts business as we go forward. So, we think there's continued to see positive momentum as we go to 2016.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful color. On your outlook for North America down 12%; U.S. and Canada down 12%, most of the industry is forecasting significantly greater decline, going back to replacement levels of somewhere around down 20%. What are you seeing out there, what are your customers telling you, what are you teams telling you? Where do you think the strength is coming from versus where others are forecasting?","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","Obviously the on-highway business is supported by strong freight tonnage metrics. They've been pretty flat but at a very high level. I think the last numbers that came out were like the second highest level on record. So, freight activities look good, the estimation for growth for next year for North America is 2% to 3% growth. So, consumer demand is strong. And so, we see a lot of positives that are going to support a good market.","If you look at the 230,000 trucks to 260,000 trucks, it could be the second third best in the last decade. So, it's a good market for next year. So, we're optimistic about how things will develop as we talk to customers, as I think we commented last quarter. Customers are ordering \u2013 that have ordered are ordering levels comparable to what they ordered in 2015. I'd say a little bit of the difference is just that their expectations last year, the expectations for delivery were, they needed them as soon as they could get them. And now, they're thinking a little bit spreading those deliveries out a little further across the year. So, we're seeing positive things overall.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would add that Kenworth and Peterbilt are very strong in the vocational segment and construction activity continues to be strong, forecasted to grow once again for residential housing in 2016 and so the vocational segment for us is performing very well, especially with the new products that we're introducing into both Kenworth and Peterbilt.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And does that give you confidence in guiding to flattish or comparable margins, year-over-year despite a decline in revenue?","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","As we look at the expectations for the year, cost and...","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Our parts mix will grow a little bit and the parts margins are obviously good. We'll continue to operate it at a very high level in the Parts business and that should be a net positive for margins as well.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, very good. I appreciate the color. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","A couple questions. One, it sounds like you guys are obviously more constructive relative to your peers, but if you look at the industry numbers, cancellation rates have picked up over the past several months. Have you seen any of that, or have you been immune to that?","And then I guess a broader, just cycle question, do you view this as a \u2013 obviously, the level decline you're expecting this year is less than the industry, but do you view this as a one year, mid-cycle pause, or would you look at this more as a normal downturn? Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Cancellation activity in our operations are very normal. There's nothing unusual that is happening in that arena. And in terms of where we're at in the cycle, I think that's to be determined. The economic fundamentals are positive, and we see that we're going to track what the demand is, and we think the demand is going to be a good market for 2016.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Ronald E.

Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hello, everybody.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","First question on the Parts business revenue in the quarter, Ron, you mentioned inventory rebalancing in the channel. Was that broad-based, or was it concentrated in some of the regions?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think that was general across the dealer body.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then on the margin question somebody asked earlier, if you compare the margin in the quarter with the run rate of the first three quarters, which was very strong, the margin in the quarter went down roughly a couple hundred basis points. Is that all seasonality, or was there an impact from this rebalancing?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there are obviously some operating leverage effects in there, and it probably reflects more the mix of parts that were being distributed during the quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then in truck, I just was hoping a little bit more clarity to one of Jerry's question. Could you talk about what you saw in European truck in terms of the order activity in Q4? Was it as strong a growth as you saw in the first few quarters, or is it moderating in line with your outlook there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's steady and I'd say in line with our outlook. Yes, I think that's a good way to say it.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then in the U.S. and Canada, you had some order volatility toward the end of the year, November weak, December better. Did you see that December better continuing into January, or are we into a little bit of the seasonal doldrums there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think most of the ups and downs are just timing of when some of the larger fleet orders appear in the order board. So I think as I said, large fleets are planning buys, and their buys are generally pretty consistent with what we saw for deliveries in 2015.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with Bank of Montreal.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. How is it going?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good. Good morning.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's good. Good morning, good afternoon, whatever. Anyway, we keep dancing around this question. I just wondered if you could spend a couple of minutes giving us a little more of a comprehensive list underneath the volume numbers which you obviously give us for the industry. Can you just give us a couple of the bigger factors? You talked about mix and parts being better, but some of the bigger factors that are going to drive profitability, pricing, under-absorption, any manufacturing efficiency improvements, people reductions, mix between the U.S. and Europe, just a couple of the bigger ones to help us get a feel for what some of the levers are you have inside to control the margins.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think if you just go down the list, I think pricing reflects good markets. And so we have great products to offer the market, so we feel good that our products demand a fair price in the marketplace.","Cost, I think there's probably a little bit of downward momentum on prices with commodity cost reductions. so that's a bit of a benefit. But everybody is getting that same benefit in the industry. Our factories and businesses around the world do a great job of managing their cost structure. And our purchasing groups around the world do a great job of procuring and working closely with our suppliers. We have a great supply base that provides us timely deliveries, quality parts. And so we work closely with them to make sure that we can support our business and our factories can operate efficiently.","So all the factors as we talked about R&D for next year, we're projecting a little bit of an uptick. That R&D spending will occur pretty ratably during the course of the year. We manage our SG&A closely. We're thinking SG&A for next year will be comparable to our 2015 levels, and that those amounts will be pretty comparable quarter to quarter. So as we look at next year, we feel good about the prospects of being able to continue to manage in a very prudent, cost effective way.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's great. And then have you shared at all a medium or longer-term view on medium-duty market share? I know you've had a big new product push for the last couple of years, and it seems to be working.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We have great medium-duty products and more and more of our dealers are becoming engaged in the medium-duty business. And I think we're seeing the benefits of that over time in North America. We have great products in Europe. As I mentioned, with the increase in share, we did get to a record level of medium-duty deliveries last year. And we'll continue to invest in our product, to continue to make enhancements, and look forward to continuing to have opportunity to grow that business going forward.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. So there's no number on where you could be five or 10 years from now.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't. We obviously continue to push the number. We're 27% share of the heavy-duty market, 17% of the medium-duty market in North America, so there's lots of upside for us.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right.

Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're seeing prices pretty stable in the U.S. and Canadian market as we progress through the first parts of the year. So, we expect that that will continue.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That's great. And then just a clarification on the parts outlook. Could you just go through that by region?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's our expectation, really in both regions, some level of growth in the 3% to 5% range for both North America, Europe. And obviously, we're starting to grow our business in Brazil. So...","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Got you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","...that's our overall perspective.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then when we think about your parts margin outlook going into 2016, should we expect the mix that impacted 4Q to continue to be a headwind, or is that something that largely corrects itself with inventory rebalancing and would sort of go back to the levels of the first nine months of 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think our margin expectations for next year will be comparable to 2015.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.

Absolutely.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we got 105,000 engines that we've produced out of our Columbus factory.

Maybe I missed it. The production for the full-year of 2016, North America and Europe, I know you gave us the first quarter sequentially, but what's the full-year assumption?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't have \u2013 provide that level of detail. But you can look at the market size estimates, and I think get to a pretty good number.","David Raso - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","So your production versus those industry forecasts, you'd say, are very much in line?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","David Raso - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Again, I know we're asking the same question again, but over the last 30 years, you have eight years of revenue declines; and seven of them, gross margins go down. So is there something about the currency benefit, North America buying from Europe? But obviously North America is down more than Europe is in 2016. So that one has fully explained it.","Can you help us more on price cost? It's just obviously history would tell you, for you to be forecasting flat gross margins is abnormal. So, with a little more specificity, can you help us understand where is the difference between your history that down volume equals flat gross margins? I know the Parts is helpful, but at 17% of the business, it's not that large. So, again, it's an important issue for all of us, so we appreciate the detail.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. It's all the factors that we talked about. I mean, it's the cost management aspects, the favorable potential movement from commodity cost movements. So, all the elements of our total margin picture play into that and there's no one individual item that I can point to and say, that's the difference.","David Raso - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","The kind of arguments that Parts being bigger is today you're more vertically integrated in North America, so thus bottom decline would be more painful than prior down cycles. I mean, I know it's not a big number, but there's something about heavy expenditures, building up Brazil now the market that weak. There's some easy retrenchment of recouping of levels of losses in Brazil. We're just trying to flash out why are you that comfortable guiding flat gross margins.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do you have anything else to add, David? Thank you.","David Raso - International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. No, I appreciate it.

We put a lot of medium-duty trucks into the construction market and so that's been strong. And as a result, our deliveries into that market have been strong. And we would expect that to continue at good strong levels in 2016.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Okay.","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","We've also introduced some new product, the Cab-Over products at Kenworth and Peterbilt are both beginning to develop good traction. More and more of our dealers are stocking and selling those trucks. And that's a net contribution to our medium-duty production as well.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up to used truck pricing in North America, what are you seeing with regards to used truck inventory levels in the channel currently? Are they a bit high and then would you expect them to normalize at some point this year?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think used truck inventory levels for PACCAR are very normal, yeah. We have a pretty normal level of used trucks and we expect that sort of stay as we look at lease returns, et cetera. As we progress through the year, we should be able to keep that at very normal levels throughout the year.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","All right, thanks. I'll pass it on.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just on the Europe delivery volumes last quarter and what you're looking for in the first quarter, it seems like it would be at a higher rate for the market than where your 15% shares or so. So could you talk about whether there's an inventory build effort right now into the year, or are there opportunities where you think there's an increase in market share in 2016?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Again, as we talked about earlier on market share, we have a long tradition of building that share and our teams had done a great job of getting the products in place, great products in place with really industry-leading fuel efficiency, and so we continue to target growing our share into various markets. And there's inventory levels throughout the channel, dealer inventories in Europe are in great shape. And so there's no real inventory buildup or reduction. It's pretty steady.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just a last one, I guess. On the share repurchase, it looks like a little bit faster pace into the end of the year than where you have been previously. Any reason that that was maybe abnormal, or is that kind of a level that you anticipated and you would only need another authorization to keep going at that level?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Obviously, as we said in our press release, we think the shares are an attractive option at the current pricing level. And so, we expect we'll continue to do some share repurchases during the course of 2016, as we do in many years.","Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning. Good afternoon.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","I was wondering if we could dig into the Finance business, your aspirations for 2016, how you expect that business to unfold. And then within there, the Leasing business, maybe you could talk about some of the key operating trends that you follow. What have you been seeing in the business, and how are you thinking about it for 2016?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think as we look at our portfolio and our asset base, I think the earning asset \u2013 average earning assets that we'll have for 2016 would be fairly comparable to our 2015 levels, which were really at record levels. And the Leasing business has done very well over a long period of time, celebrating their 35th anniversary in 2015.","They continue to work very closely with our dealers and our customers to continue to grow that business. They ended the year with a record level of units in the fleet, and we continue to look for opportunities to expand our business in Europe. And during 2015, we launched our PacLease business in Australia. So continue to look for ways to have leasing make a valuable contribution to the overall company results.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then could you talk to \u2013 it's not a big expense for you. But could you talk to your pension expense expectations for 2016?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think they'll be very comparable to \u2013 it's a pretty steady level. It obviously gets impacted by the level of employment, discount rates, et cetera. So I think we'll see maybe some benefit from a slightly higher discount rate that will benefit pension expense a little bit in 2016 for North America.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Rathod with Macquarie.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","There seems to be a lot of press recently on autonomous vehicles from large tech companies. It seems like they're moving regulation forward in various s states. And if you look at it objectively, the technology is getting better. The miles driven autonomously is going exponentially. How does PACCAR think about this? What steps are you guys taking today for a potential market in the future on the truck side? And generally, how do you feel it's evolving?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So all of our truck divisions and our engineering teams around the world are involved in evaluating all the technologies that can benefit our customers, including the technologies that will support autonomous driving. We've demonstrated autonomous vehicles at various exhibitions in North America. Our team in Europe has also demonstrated their autonomous capabilities with tuning activities, working with government and educational institutions. So a lot of work in that area, working closely with suppliers who have the technologies that can support that activity. So it's an ongoing activity. I think we're several years away from seeing that in the truck business. But we're right at the forefront of all the developments that are going on in that arena.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Jeff, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Sorry about that. I had the mute on. Good morning, everyone.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. A lot of questions have been asked on the margins and the gross margins in your core markets. I'd like to go in a different direction and talk about some of the emerging and expanding markets. That was a big highlight of an analyst meeting you had just a little bit ago when you were talking about your plans in Russia and your plans in Brazil. These markets are obviously very weak right now. Wouldn't you think that this is a very good time strategically to be moving in and making investments in these markets? So I guess two questions. Number one, how are you doing in the various emerging markets, and what are your forecasts for those areas? And then of the CapEx that you're spending, how much of that is dedicated to emerging market investment right now?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Obviously, Brazil, we've made a significant investment in our new plant operations, the products that we've launched and are launching in the market. We're excited about the prospects for Brazil and the rest of South America as we go forward. Our teams are doing a great job. We have a great dealer representation that is representing the DAF product in the Brazilian market. We have the opportunity to increase our production and increase our penetration. We had an excellent showing at the Fenatran truck show in November in S\u00e3o Paulo. So our team enters 2016 with a lot of positive momentum in a challenging market.","In Russia, the DAF organization there has done a good job over the last years of increasing the number of locations representing the DAF product. And when the economy improves in Russia, we'll be able to grow our deliveries in that particular region.","If you look at Asia, still an area of opportunity for our company. We continue to evaluate ways that we can participate greater. We have great presence in India and China with our purchasing activities, our technical office in Pune, India that supports our information technology and engineering activities. So we're very cognizant of what's going on in those markets and continue to look for opportunities to play a bigger part.","As we look forward, we just invested in Brazil with the launch of the DAF CF product, so expanding the product offerings. We're now assembling the MX engine in our DAF Brazil factory. So we'll continue to make investments in expanding the product offerings and improving the productivity and efficiency and the capacity of our operations in these markets.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And just following up on that, you did about 16,000 units of what I would call non-core markets last year. This number is small, but you gave a forecast for North America, you gave a forecast for Europe. How should we think about this non-core market's number?","Ken Hastings - Director of Investor Relations","Relatively flat 2016 compared to 2015. Certainly, that would be the case in South America, somewhere in the range of 70,000 units to 80,000 units, heavy-duty in the whole region.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I agree. I think that's a good estimate for next year.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, thank you and congratulations.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mike.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning. Hey. Do you have anything on the MX-11? Can you give us your thoughts at the \u2013 what kind of penetration you expect now there's launch for 2016? And perhaps more broadly, what should we expect to see PACCAR Engines penetration rate in the overall Class 8 market in 2016?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the MX-11, we think that will be very well-received. It's been very well-received in Europe. We think that as customers get more exposed to it and accustomed to its capability, that it will become a greater portion of our engine build in North America. We continue to ratchet up our MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt products, averaging around 40% for the year, 42% in the fourth quarter. The MX-11 will help move that further forward. And we see in the near term, next year or two, getting that up closer to the 50% range.","And as we look at the capability of our engines currently and in the coming years, it will meet roughly 80%, 85% of what customers need to do their work. And we continue to get more and more of our customers starting to take some MXs to really test them in their fleet. And typically after customers have had that chance to have that test and they see the great performance of those engines, the great fuel efficiency, more and more of those are converting their business to the MX engine. So, it will continue to progress over the next years.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Great. I think I also wanted to ask about on the large side, some of the larger moving parts here in the first quarter. Does not having a big presence at this year's Mid-America Truck Show do anything that's material to support the first quarter margins here versus the prior year?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","It's not enough to be a factor.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's not a factor.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities LLC","All right, great. Thanks, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Just want to ask you about the next upcoming greenhouse gas standard. Is that something you're already meeting or expect to meet by the deadline?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","When you say the next standard, you're talking about 2017 or the...","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, 2017.","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we're in the midst of beginning the certification process with the EPA and CARB.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. And also wanted to ask you under the new parts distribution facility in Renton. Is it possible to quantify how much you expect to have to add to the parts revenue and do you view that as being something that is more able to maintain the historical growth rate you've had of about 8% in parts revenue growth, or is it something that can enable you to grow faster than that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I think it supports and we've got a long history of incrementing our parts distribution capacity, almost every year, in some form or fashion and so this is just the next step to continue to support that ongoing growth level for our parts operations.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. That's all I had. Thank you.","Ronald E.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; Bob Christensen, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","[Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. It's a pleasure to share that in 2013, PACCAR achieved record annual revenues and earned our third best annual net income. For the year, PACCAR reported record revenues of $17.1 billion. Net income was $1.170 billion, an increase of 5% versus a year ago. 2013 was PACCAR's 75th consecutive year of earning a net income.","Having been at the helm of this great company for each of the top 10 years for revenue and net income, I can say that each year has its own unique path. What is consistent is the quality and determination of our 22,000 employees, who delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers every day.","PACCAR reported strong revenues and net income for the fourth quarter of 2013. PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $4.6 billion, and quarterly net income was $334 million and after-tax return on revenues of 7.3%. This was the best quarterly net income since the first quarter of 2007.","Net income increased 32% compared to results generated in the fourth quarter last year. Positive contribution of all the company segments enables PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry and to deliver excellent shareholder returns while investing during all phases of the business cycle.","PACCAR declared cash dividends of $1.70 per share last year, an 8% increase compared to 2012. PACCAR's total return to shareholders was 34.9% last year, and stockholder equity at year-end was a record $6.6 billion.","PACCAR delivered 36,400 trucks during the fourth quarter, a 3% increase versus the third quarter. The improvement reflects increased European truck deliveries as customers purchased trucks ahead of the January 1, 2014 implementation of the Euro 6 regulations.","PACCAR began production of many new vocational vehicles in the fourth quarter, the Peterbilt Model 567, the Kenworth T880 and DAF CF and LF Euro 6 models. In addition, we began production of the new PACCAR MX-11 diesel engine for Europe. This engine is planned to be available in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks in 2015. We expect to increase truck deliveries in the first quarter by 5% compared to a year ago.","A major highlight during the fourth quarter was the start of production at DAF's new truck assembly plant in Brazil. This wonderful accomplishment was due to the efforts of many PACCAR employees worldwide. Truck production of the DAF facility is planned to gradually increase over the next 18 to 24 months. DAF has a long-term market share goal in Brazil of 20%. Brazil truck market above 6 tonnes was 149,000 vehicles last year and is expected to be at comparable levels this year.","Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved excellent market share of 28% in the U.S. and Canadian heavy-duty truck market last year. Industry retail truck sales totaled 212,000 units. U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 210,000 to 240,000 units this year, reflecting ongoing replacement demand and some expansion of the industry fleet. For the full year, DAF achieved record market share of 16.2% in the above 16-tonne European truck market, which totaled 240,000 units last year.","Looking at this year, we're encouraged by the improved GDP growth of the eurozone, which should benefit the truck market. Excluding the effects of the pre-buy, which is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 units, we anticipate that the European industry truck sales could be slightly higher this year.","Switching to parts. PACCAR Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $730 million, a 9% increase compared to $671 million in the same quarter of the prior year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $105 million, an increase of 12% compared to $94 million earned in the fourth quarter 2012. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, improved fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts. For the full year, PACCAR Parts achieved record revenues of over $2.8 billion.","PACCAR Financial Services revenue were $300 million in the fourth quarter compared to $298 million a year ago. PACCAR Financial's fourth quarter pretax income was a record $90 million compared to $79 million earned a year ago. The excellent results benefited from growth in asset balances and continuing strong portfolio performance. For the full year, PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $340 million. Many records last year.","PACCAR's capital spending of $350 million to $400 million this year is targeted at enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency of our assembly facilities. R&D expenses are estimated to be in the range of $225 million to $275 million.","On a personal note, I'd like to say thanks for the excellent questions that you have generously asked on our quarterly calls during the last 17 years. It's an honor and a privilege to work at PACCAR, and I appreciate your interest in the company as you tour our wonderful factories and meet our outstanding employees.","Thank you. Pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. Just, one, you talked about deliveries, I think, being up 5% in the first quarter. Can you talk about what you expect the mix is versus -- U.S. versus Europe? And then, I guess, also any color you're seeing in order trends in Europe as we look to January, given the strong pre-buy that we had. And then my last question, how are you thinking about the ability to improve margins in 2014 over '13, given your retail sales forecast?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Let's start with margins. We think margins for the first quarter will be comparable to about a year ago.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is that on gross or operating?","Robert J. Christensen","Gross.","Mark C. Pigott","Gross margins. And in terms of production, first quarter versus fourth quarter probably will be down about 10%, and most of that is in Europe. But as I say year-on-year, production will be up about 5%, so we're pleased with that. And as the year goes on, we look for some steady improvement in the margin side. All of Kenworth, Peterbilt, DAF are all doing a very good job, and all the new products that we've been working on for the last 3, 4 years seem to be met with very strong market reception. Customers like it. They're delivering all the attributes we wanted. And I think when we will look at things like record market share at DAF it's a very positive signal for the company.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, just last question, how do you feel about your ability to pass through -- fully pass through the Euro 6 cost? And is that margin accretive? Is the margin dilutive?","Mark C. Pigott","Initially, I think we've been able to do it reasonably well. And, obviously, that's our goal, and it's been our goal every year or 2 as we have new environmental regulations to comply with. So that's certainly something that I think we're becoming quite proficient at incorporating into our designs and working with our dealers to pass through most of that additional cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wondering if I can switch over to Brazil. And I know you mentioned that you sort of see gradually improving production rates down there. I guess, I'm just trying to sort of maybe get a little bit sharper pencil on that. Really, what I'm trying to get at is thinking about the impact on profitability in 2014. I assume it's a drag, as it was in '13, but less of a drag. And I don't know -- as we end the year, is that business breakeven? Or is that too optimistic?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the good news is we're doubling production in a week or so from 1 truck to 2 trucks a day. That's always positive.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you do that every day?","Mark C. Pigott","If you've got the magic wand, we'd be interested. So that's -- it's going well. Obviously, it's a multiple-year program as we gradually ramp up production, but we're encouraged during the early days. And I think as we get towards the end of the year, certainly, we hope to be at least breakeven at the facility. So I think your analysis is accurate.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I guess, just back on Europe for a second and then I'll pass it on. The registration data in Europe was huge in December, much bigger than what your revenues might suggest. And, I guess, I'm trying to figure out just how this whole cadence worked. Was there some inventory build that happened and then things got registered out of inventory in the fourth quarter? Or -- it doesn't look like your market share changed in any negative way. I think it was actually up a little bit, so...","Mark C. Pigott","Our market share is a record. In fact, we've got very strong market share in the fourth quarter and in December for DAF, over 17%. And so we're very, very pleased with that.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So did you sell a bunch out of inventory in the fourth quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we -- the pre-buy started in the third quarter, and inventories increased at the end of the third and during the fourth. But as we got to the end of the fourth, a lot of those trucks started to be delivered to customers, registered, and so we finished very strongly.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I got it. And then is there some delivery potential in the first quarter that's still sort of Euro 5? Or was it sort of a hard stop on January 1?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. That's a good question. Really, as we look through this year, we probably have about 20% of our production will be Euro 5, primarily for markets outside of Western Europe. So that will be ongoing for a number of years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, mostly, surprisingly around Europe. Earlier in the week, different manufacturers talked about a difficult pricing environment. Are you seeing that?","Mark C. Pigott","No. I think the pricing environment is pretty steady. If anything, it might be a little bit better. I'm not sure who you're talking about. We've increased share. Some of our competitors might have lost a little bit of share, which might have some impact on them. But our products are very well-received. We're having a lot of great truck shows. The dealers are excited about it. And our goal is to continue to have the best products in the industry and gain a little bit of share every year. So we're -- pricing is reasonable.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. It was a Scandinavian, soon-to-be German competitor. And then second, if memory serves, the U.K. had an earlier stop in terms of the Euro 6 transition, like September time frame. We're now a few months past there. Have you seen any improvement in the demand, given that the economy is doing pretty well?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, the economy, they're talking about over 2% GDP growth, I think, for the U.K. this year, which should be very healthy. Yes, they had a slightly different program in the U.K., and as a result, we still are delivering some Euro 6 and Euro 5 vehicles in the U.K. They seem to be very upbeat in the U.K. right now, which is encouraging. I know even on the car side, they're going to be well over 2 million units for the car industry. So...","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Have you seen a greater uptick in the Euro 6 appetite in the U.K. than other regions?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think there -- U.K. is always pretty forward-thinking in terms of embracing the new products. So I think our share, once again, went up in the U.K. as a marketplace, and the dealers are -- have embraced all our new products. But everybody -- in all the regions that we operate, this is every couple of year program. So I think the industry, the customers, the dealers have been through it in the last 10 years 3x. So they know the drill.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then switching over to U.S. and Canada. We've had, so far, kind of a muted cycle relative to the last 2, and we've had some recent volatility in the orders, 2 good months, 1 weaker relative month in between. How are you characterizing the cycle? I mean, is it...","Mark C. Pigott","I think we are on a steadily improving path. And a couple of reasons for that. First of all, in the fourth quarter, I'm talking about U.S. and Canada, the industry had a little over 70,000 orders, which is the best quarter since the first quarter of 2006. So that's quite a few years ago. Second, as you've seen, but just the macroeconomic data, the U.S. GDP growth in the fourth quarter was a little over 3%, which is good for all industries. And finally, as we talk with our customers, we just had our large dealer meetings, more and more fleets are saying they feel good about it. Construction is going to be -- home construction starts over 1 million, 16 million car production estimated this year. They're starting to say, \"Let's start to replace our vehicles. We feel good about our own industry. We see our end customers are improving their business.\" So I think steadily improving path, positive. So we feel good about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, can you talk about your Rest of World sales, your other sales? Those sales have continued to weaken a little bit sequentially. Do you think you are at the bottom in those markets now and you should actually start to grow again in '14? And maybe you could sort of parse out the regions for us and what you're seeing in the different regions.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. We look at Rest of the World or -- we look at all these home markets. That's how we look at them. Russia continues to be a very strong growth story for us. And 3,900 units, primarily DAF and some Kenworth trucks in there, adding new dealers, very excited about that market. Taiwan, we're now the second largest market share in the sort of 16-tonne market, and that continues to grow. Mexico is down a little bit because of some, let's call it, economic changes that they're implementing, but we think that's starting to stabilize. Colombia, which is a very strong market for us for most of the last decade, has declined because they finished some major infrastructure projects. I think that's now probably at a stable platform, and hopefully, that will improve. Australia, actually, is improving again. It's been pretty good through all the last decade. So for us, we see that's a very important part of our business, and probably, we're -- we might be at the low point and look for some positive improvement there.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful, Mark. And then maybe if I could shift to PACCAR Parts. For the year, you had about 6% growth, but your fleet continues to get larger. You've talked about adding distribution centers. You've added them. We're going to see some growth here in the overall aftermarket. So can we see some acceleration in that business in '14? And should we see some margin improvement still? I mean, it's been good margins, but it has been improving. But could we see that continue?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well, I'm very proud of the team at Parts, record total revenues, $2.8 billion, and as you've indicated, they continue to grow. We're looking for some growth again this year of, hopefully, at least 5%. We did add a number of the Parts distribution centers. Our largest one in Eindhoven opened up about a year ago. And we continue to examine. Do we need additional one? We have a new PDC in Brazil connected with the factories. That's starting to -- its operations. So they're all -- these Parts guys are always coming up with very innovative ideas that we still -- we have a record truck market out there in terms of number of vehicles, and they're doing a very good job of growing the business into other businesses, whether it's competitive brands or bus business, trailer business. So that's a big driver for us, at least 5% growth this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Michael Shlisky - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's Mike Shlisky filling in for Ann. Kind of a 2-part question here on Brazil. Can you maybe share with us what market share of retail sales you expect to get by the end of the year in 2014? And then, I guess, part 2 of that would be, would production -- would the share of factory shipments be above retail for 2014, given the ramp here?","Robert J. Christensen","Yes. Our share -- it's early days, but 1% to 2%, I think, is a very reasonable target. And as soon as we get the orders in, we build them, we ship them, we sell them. So it's pretty quick process for us in Brazil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, a bit of an improvement in market share and financial position since '97, I think.","Mark C. Pigott","It's been a great company for 108 years, and it's just a great company going forward.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering, Ron, if you could just talk about what are the biggest strategic priorities that you see for the business over the next 3 to 5 years. And obviously, we're building out the business in Brazil, but I'm wondering if you could just expand and talk about additional opportunities that you're evaluating.","Mark C. Pigott","Let me jump in on that. Probably, that'll be a great topic probably when I'm not actually in the seat. So let's kind of take that off-line.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Alright. Fair enough. Mark, for the Parts business, can you just talk about the trends that you're seeing in Europe? Obviously, everyone is focused on the pre-buy, but the underlying freight volumes have actually been really positive over the past couple of quarters. Are you seeing the same thing in your Parts business? And does that -- I guess, what does that mean for your expectations of production ramp over the course of the second quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","For Parts?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry, for trucks. So if the Parts business is picking up steam, presumably, we could see orders picking up for new trucks once we get through the overhang.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, Parts -- well, let's just start with Parts. But Parts in Europe is -- has done a very good job, and they said they've got some new infrastructure and new programs there. The dealers have completely embraced a lot of the new innovative program that they've introduced. So we're encouraged with Parts, and we think that'll have some growth this year. I think on the trucks side, everybody, the whole industry benefited from the pre-buy, and I think a number of the manufacturers are back to production levels that they were at about a year ago. And as Europe gets a positive GDP, we expect to gradually increase production.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And, Mark, in terms of the Parts performance of the quarter, was it stronger in Europe or in North America? Can you just give us some color?","Mark C. Pigott","It was pretty good all the way around, yes. Aren't they all? All the different areas made a good contribution.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And lastly, in the U.S., your trucking customers have had trouble pushing price increases or at least as anticipated in '13. I'm wondering if you could talk about what you're hearing from them about the pricing landscape for their business at this point as they set some of their annual contracts in the spring.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think, basically, the customers are doing well. Some of them have seen profits down from a year ago. Some have seen them up. But I think, overall, as the U.S. and Canadian economies achieve some strong GDP growth, I think that will be good for our customers, and I think they're optimistic. They've been through some tough times, but over the last year or 2 or 3, things are improving. So you're starting to see some pretty good results from a wide range of industries, and most of them have some sort of trucking impact in terms of deliveries or shipments or whatever. So I think our customers are feeling pretty good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montreal.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","It's a shame you don't have the pleasure of Navistar competing in Europe. I'm sure they'll find a way to ship those '05 engines all the way out until '17.","Mark C. Pigott","I'm not sure.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wonder if -- since you sound like you're being a little more generous than usual on trying to help us out, can you help us understand some of the mix implications for 2014? Because everyone's asking about margins. I think this would help to clear it up, the growth rate of Parts relative to Europe, relative to the U.S. and what all those pieces do for the mix.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think the -- we're looking at, as I said, 5%-plus growth for Parts, and we expect to see that both in North America and in Europe. So I don't know what else I can really add in terms of that. Kenworth, Peterbilt, we're looking for steady growth in terms of increased production. DAF, we think we've covered in pretty much good detail. And we continue to have some growth outside of Western Europe, so that's encouraging. And to say we just launched a whole new range of vocational vehicles just in the last few months in Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF, and I think the timing appears to be very good as the, let's call it, the construction markets, different applications are starting to see some improved economics. So we feel good about that also.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Is the faster Kenworth, Peterbilt growth relative to DAF good for margins?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think all of our truck groups have good margins. So we look to improve every one of our truck brands.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. It was worth a try. And then even -- I guess, your seat is still warm, so I want to ask if there's any chance to use the balance sheet a little more aggressively. But is there any updated thinking? Lots of companies have piled up the cash, and they're looking at other ways to deploy it. And I know you spent a lot of time building out engines, and you're building out Brazil and the rest of the planet. Are there any other things on the horizon?","Mark C. Pigott","No. We've had strong return to our shareholders, very important platform for our company versus, say, 108 years, and that will continue to be a main driver for PACCAR. And we've had steady growth in our quarterly dividend program. And when appropriate, we've had the special dividend. And I think our cash position is pretty much in line with where it's been for a number of years. And yes, as you say, we have invested a lot in many parts of the world, and I think that'll start to really generate some positive benefits for the company over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to gauge your confidence in the 150,000 [ph] Brazil market forecast relative to your confidence in the growth of some of the other markets.","Mark C. Pigott","Last year, as you know, it's 149,000 [ph], and we said it's going to be comparable. We are increasing our production rates. As I mentioned, Brazil, certainly, has been in the news in the last few months about different macroeconomic policies. In terms of the effect on us, probably not that much because we're really just growing our business right now, people like the DAF products. Our dealers are investing and putting in new service locations throughout the country. Obviously, we track what's going on in a macro level, but we continue to invest in Brazil. And we look at this as a 50- to 100-year program, and we're excited about it.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","More of your own company actions are going to be more impactful than what overall market is there, it sounds like.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the vocational side of the new products you launched, at what point would you have a view on the traction that those new products are gaining in the marketplace?","Mark C. Pigott","I think we're having already a positive view just in the last month or so, and it's certainly very early days. Certainly, on the dealer side, on the customer side, we're starting to get some orders, and the product seems to be doing very, very well and meeting the expectations of what our customers expect. It's a little bit wider cap and very fuel-efficient, very comfortable and seem to be just what the customers are -- have been looking for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So just to expand on the comments earlier, you mentioned a little bit of a broadening recovery in the U.S. Construction across different types of machines had some pretty mixed results. What are your thoughts on whether you're actually starting to see a more sustained improvement in the construction, vocational, dumps, cement, all the different kinds of trucks serving the construction industry?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think 2 major ones. One would be home construction. The other one that's been in the news, obviously, is with natural gas. Looking at home construction, it's rebounding at a reasonable rate. Everything that goes into a house is brought by a truck. A lot of trucks are in that business, whether it's steel, brick, glass, sofas, white goods, whatever. So that -- I think that is very encouraging on the natural gas exploration. That's -- I think it's been pretty stable to a little bit lower in the last year or 2. But I think home construction is very strong. And then on the cars, 16 million cars, trucks play a very important part of that. And moving componentry to factories, completed goods from factories to dealerships. So we're encouraged by that also.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Let me ask you a different question. Just you had a little bit of a pulse on the R&D with all the emissions, and you did seemingly a very, very successful launch [indiscernible] with the penetration-type [indiscernible] and everything. So really, really successful. And then R&D is coming down a little bit as a result. Do you think that this is sort of a temporary down and you've got a couple of ways of investment to come as more -- I mean, there's a little bit less tightness on the emission. There's always fuel economy. Or do you think that -- or that was the pulse before and we're at a new level at this point relative to sales?","Mark C. Pigott","You're talking about the R&D expenditures?","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. That's right.","Mark C. Pigott","I think R&D -- we've had so many wonderful products and projects underway in the last 5-plus years, as we always do. We have a lot of programs going on right now. I think R&D might be a little bit lower this year than last year. As you say, we've concluded a lot of these programs. They're doing well and maybe a little bit lower for next year or so but still at a very steady rate.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just had a question on -- I mean, you may have addressed this, but I apologize if you did. Can you give the penetration of the PACCAR engines in North America currently and sort of what your goals are there?","Mark C. Pigott","We did in sort of high-30%, 37%, 38%, and our goal is to keep growing it. I think as we look at the entire industry of last year for North America, as we mentioned this in the last year or so, the 13-liter, which is the engine that we have -- of course, we just introduced a new 11-liter for Europe, soon to be in North America. But 13-liter is about 50% of the market, and the 15-liter is about 50%. So that seems to be holding very true. And we think that the 13-liter will continue to grow, so we feel good about it. And we've now manufactured over 50,000 engines at our Mississippi factory, and it's doing well on the launch.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Good. And maybe one for Bob. Could you address what happened with that provision in Financial Services in the quarter? Is that just a true-up for the year? How did that work?","Robert J. Christensen","Yes, it really reflects just the timing of some recoveries on some previous charge-offs that we've had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Going back to a question about your customers, fleet utilization is running very, very high. It's in the high-90% range. I mean, do you have a view of what the upward limit of that is? And do you get the sense that your customers are pushing that higher relative to prior cycles?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, yes. I think you're correct, it's probably mid-90s, low- to mid-90s. Sometimes it's a little hard to actually get an accurate number on fleet utilization. It's certainly higher than it's been because we've been through some challenging times. But starting a few years ago, I think fleets have focused on their improved fleet utilization. Obviously, there is an upper limit. It's hard to get more than 100%, but -- basic math. But -- and I think that's one of the positive drivers for our industry in terms of orders. And as I mentioned, fourth quarter was 70,000 units for the industry. That -- you get to mid-90s, and for a customer to grow, you've got to probably take on additional trucks. So I think that's another positive factor in our industry this year.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just separately on the smaller fleet, smaller customer, smaller fleet side, are you seeing anything with more available financing? And, obviously, PACCAR Financial or just across the industry, have you been noticing any loosening up towards the smaller operators?","Mark C. Pigott","I think there's pretty good financing available out there. Certainly, we've got a great program with PACCAR Financial. Then we have our leasing arm, which is doing pretty well and achieving strong results. And then we see a few more banks coming back into the business. As the economy improves, everybody wants to get back into it. So I think for the small to medium to large fleets, there's certainly good availability for financing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Sticking with the engine team a bit, you sold 50,000 units in North America. It seems that some those are starting to come into the warranty, out of warranty coverage. I'm just wondering if that is a bigger factor in 2014 than it was in 2013 for the Parts business.","Mark C. Pigott","No. It's a good question, but I don't think it really has any impact. No. We're still probably a little ways away from sort of the positive impact on maybe parts and service side of it, still really growing our population of engines is the way I'd look at it.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got it. And then could you guys comment on the impact of currency to the quarter for revenue and earnings?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes.","Robert J. Christensen","Yes, sure. The impact on earnings was about $12 million, and the impact on revenues was about $80 million, positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the currency question, Bob and Robin, if I can. You said it was $12 million positive to earnings in the quarter. Could you differentiate that, say, your euro exposure versus your real exposure? And then talk about, given the big moves we've seen in the currency markets, particularly emerging markets, how could this impact 2014 just based on your outlook?","Robert J. Christensen","Well, the impact on the quarter -- that $12 million is a pretax number, just to clarify. And the impact was mostly from the movement of the euro. And currently, our revenue stream from Brazil is low enough that it's not going to have a big impact on us, the movements of the real.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then looking toward the year, you would say no real real impact as you're ramping up Brazil?","Mark C. Pigott","Correct.","Robert J. Christensen","No.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then I was just kind of thinking about cash. You mentioned, Mark, that maybe this year is an off year for R&D, but normally, relative to your revenues, the spending is a little higher. Is this more of a respite for a year and then the spending picks up a little? Or do you think this is a good run rate for R&D for you right now?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think right now, it's probably a reasonable run rate, and then in a year or 2, you get into, call it, early midlife updates on the vehicles. There's always engine work going on and continue to look at enhancements to our facility but I think reasonable run rate right now.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And final question. I'm sure this is something you'll hit at the truck show in March. What are the 1 or 2 new products that excite you most as you head into 2014?","Mark C. Pigott","I think as I mentioned earlier, the timing for Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF to come out with their new vocational vehicles seems to be -- it looks like we have some great sales and marketing guys. I think they really hit the timing perfectly with these new products coming out. And the MX-11, I think that's going to be a big win for PACCAR for -- once again, for all of our truck guys around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from KSA Capital.","Timothy Denoyer","I had a couple of quick cash flow questions for you. I'm wondering if you can help me understand the cash flow -- operating cash coming from the manufacturing operations. I know you don't break it out that way, but if we look at the $2.4 billion of total operating cash flow and take out the $300 million of finance income, $600 million of equipment depreciation and it looks like you usually have about $200 million of residual value and deferred revenue, are there any other big factors to consider when just trying to get out the manufacturing operating cash flow?","Mark C. Pigott","Excellent question. No, I mean, that's -- you've hit most of the main segments.","Timothy Denoyer","Okay. Great. And then one other cash flow question. I noticed that you didn't buy back any stock in 2013 after buying back about $500 million in '11 and '12. Could you talk about why not? Obviously, you're still in a very healthy cash position to just not financially viable [ph].","Mark C. Pigott","We continue to evaluate it, and we do have authorization, as it makes sense to do it. Right now, we're -- we've been investing in new products and engines and factories and distribution centers. But certainly, an ongoing strategic road for us.","Timothy Denoyer","Great. Okay. And if I could throw just one more in. You talked about the success of your own -- of your natural gas products. Can you talk about whether or not you would consider taking some of your PACCAR engines and using -- and putting -- switching those over to natural gas?","Mark C. Pigott","Absolutely. Yes. No, it's -- we got great engines and it's something that is always being evaluated.","Timothy Denoyer","Is there any time frame?","Mark C. Pigott","No time frame at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So, Mark, you mentioned a couple of times about the strong order momentum in fourth quarter. Can you give us a view on kind of what you're expecting for first quarter order momentum? So certainly, the truckers are seeing tighter capacity and rates starting to move up. Do you feel like there's any improving momentum on first quarter orders? And I know it's early, but the range of 210,000 to 240,000 for '14 is kind of wide. Do you have a view towards the upper or lower end of that range at this point?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think as we're here in the last day of January, I think we'll stay with that range. But I think your analysis is correct, and we look forward to updating you in a few months. And I can say we've got an important truck show coming up in probably about 6 weeks. We'll get a better flavor then. But it looks encouraging, I'll just put it that way.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on that last nat gas question. What do you -- what price do you think nat gas needs to be for that to be a competitive option? Is it losing some competitiveness with gas at $5 right now, nat gas at $5?","Mark C. Pigott","Excellent question. I think we've got [ph] probably a little more time than we might have on this call because it's -- I think the price of natural gas, the price differential to diesel is just one component of that equation. The other ones have certainly been discussed and debated and reviewed, and that is the infrastructure, the benefit and the effects of the improving diesel engines. So the way we look at it is that we're very pleased to have a strong share of the natural gas market. It's still in that 1% to 2% range for the total industry as it grows, and we expect it will grow over time. We will look to grow our own business with it. And so that's a broad, broad discussion that probably we don't have time to do right now.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes. Just one follow-up on that point. Where do you see the spread right now and the cost of the truck for diesel versus nat gas? And has that started to come in yet?","Mark C. Pigott","One more time with that question.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","The spread -- the difference between the cost of buying a diesel truck versus nat gas truck right now. And is that coming in?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think that cost is declining as we are getting a little bit more volume of installing natural gas onto our trucks, our chassis. And some of the suppliers are gearing up to improve the efficiency of making some of the componentry. So I think, over time, that spread will decline, will decrease.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - G. Research, Inc.","A question for you on just kind of from a directional perspective. I've seen you use prices on some of your trucks over the course of, let's say, the last 9 -- 3, 6 and 9 months. I guess I'll take it from there.","Mark C. Pigott","Used trucks, really, both in North America and Europe, our brands continue to maintain their strong position relative to the competition, and it's been really steady over the last year.","Brian Sponheimer - G. Research, Inc.","So I'd say a truck coming off of a program in December, would you be getting the same price for that truck in December that, say, you would have gotten in April or May of this past year?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Yes, we would.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Robinson from Susquehanna.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could give us an update on the investments you're making in the enhanced powertrain development, maybe give us a sense for the timetable.","Mark C. Pigott","We're working on the SuperTruck project with the government and Cummins, and that's exciting. And we're just looking at the whole, let's call it, powertrain componentry and what we can do, either working with our suppliers or working independently on continuing to enhance and make it more efficient. So I think that's about all we really can talk about.","Tim Robinson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, Parts, the margins were great all year, and it looks like there was a bit a tail-off in 4Q. I'm just wondering, is there seasonality in that business that we should be aware of? Or what drove the sequential decline there?","Mark C. Pigott","There's really not that much. I mean, I would say each quarter has its own season, but we look to ramp up each quarter, depending on that season. So that really is not a factor. I think there was just a lot of Parts business in the fourth quarter, and I think they did a great job of handling it. So I don't think there's much to read into that.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Robin E.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And if anyone has any objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior calls, if there are media -- members of the media participating, we request that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the third quarter of 2012. PACCAR's third quarter sales revenue were $3.8 billion, and quarterly net income was $234 million, an aftertax return on revenues of 6.1%. For the first 9 months of this year, revenues were $13 billion, up 13% compared to the same period last year. Net income for the 9 months was $858 million, a 20% increase versus the same period last year. Earnings per share for the first 9 months this year were $2.41, an increase of 24% compared to the same period last year. I'm pleased to report that the results for the first 3 quarters of this year are the fourth best 9-month results in PACCAR's history. In addition, PACCAR's dividend increased by 38% compared to a year ago.","I'm very proud of our 22,500 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. Our dealers and customers in North America and Europe are benefiting from good freight demand and good freight rates, as evidenced by strong aftermarket parts and service business and excellent PACCAR Financial Services performance. Customers are focused primarily on truck replacement as they navigate the uncertain global economy.","PACCAR delivered 31,200 trucks during the third quarter, about 17% lower than the second quarter. However, year-to-date, we delivered 12% more trucks than the same period in 2011. More good news is that Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF grew their market share to record levels as customers recognize the benefit of our high-quality and efficient trucks. PACCAR's retail share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market was 29% for the first 9 months. DAF's market share of truck registrations in Europe, above 16-tonnes reached a record 16%. In the Andean region of South America, that's the region outside of Mercosur, Kenworth and DAF deliveries increased by 38% to record levels in the first 9 months of this year compared to the same period last year.","And looking forward, PACCAR could deliver 1% to 2% more trucks in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, recognizing that in Europe we have our traditional summer shutdown. U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to improve this year to a range of 210,000 to 220,000 units, up 9% compared to the 197,000 units registered last year. In Europe, the above 16-tonne truck market is anticipated to be in a range of 215,000 to 225,000 units this year compared to 241,000 units registered last year.","Looking at the 2013 market, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to improve to a range of 210,000 to 240,000 units. In Europe, the market next year for above 16-tonne truck market registrations are anticipated to be in the range of 210,000 to 250,000 units, as some customers may purchase Euro 5 vehicles ahead of the introduction of the Euro 6 emission requirements in January 2014.","2012 has been a milestone year for PACCAR, as we've launched more new trucks than at any time in our history. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have updated over 60% of their product range with new, fuel-efficient, ergonomic and I'd like to say, stylish vehicles. At the IAA truck show in Hannover, Germany, DAF launched its newest model, the DAF XF Euro 6, which is powered by the fuel-efficient PACCAR MX-13 Euro 6 engine. This is the most comprehensive design and development program in DAF's 84-year history. Customer and dealer feedback has been excellent. And I think some of you listening today have had a chance to be at that Hannover show and see the truck in person. DAF will commence production of this new model in the second quarter next year. The new Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt Model 579 are now in production, and customers and dealers are very enthusiastic. PACCAR is well positioned for future growth as the truck markets recover.","It's also interesting to note, speaking of products, that the North American truck industry, 13-liter engines are now at 50% of the market, comparable to the 15-liter share. That's good news for our MX engine.","Looking around the world, our business initiatives are performing well. Capital spending this year is estimated to be $475 million to $525 million. And in 2013, we'll invest between $400 million and $500 million. Research and development expenses this year are estimated to be $280 million to $290 million. And next year, R&D will be in the range of $275 million to $325 million.","Construction of our new DAF assembly factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, is progressing. And we plan to be building DAF trucks in Brazil late next year. And there's a nice picture of the plant in the press release.","CapEx will also continue to be invested in our regular product development programs. PACCAR is enhancing its network of 15 Parts Distribution Centers. We're building a new 280,000-square-foot distribution center in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, to be open next spring. We're doubling the capacity of our distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And we're also constructing a new distribution center in Brazil to complement our new DAF factory.","PACCAR Financial revenues were $274 million in the third quarter compared to $264 million last year. PACCAR Financial's third quarter pretax income jumped to a quarterly record $80 million compared to $62 million earned in the third quarter last year. The record results benefited from growth in portfolio balances and a lower provision for credit losses. PACCAR Financial, with its strong A+ credit ratings, has excellent access to the commercial paper and medium-term note markets. PACCAR Financial has issued over $1.9 billion in medium-term notes this year.","In conclusion, PACCAR is enhancing its leadership position in the global truck market by investing in new geographic regions, building on the strength of our dealers worldwide, a robust finance company and the highest-quality products in the industry. Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, you mentioned delivering 1% to 2% more trucks in 4Q. Can you talk about truck production in 4Q? Has it stabilized for you guys? I mean, we've -- we noticed inventories are up a little bit as sales have fallen. So how do we look at margins in 4Q? Do we have more absorption issues in 4Q than we did in 3Q, I guess, is what I'm trying to ask.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. We're talking about 1% to 2% more production in Q4. And as I indicated, we have our normal couple-week summer shutdown in Europe, as most companies do. And we're past the summer, so we're just back to business as usual. And margins for the fourth quarter, I think, will be comparable to the third quarter.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Mark, it's fair to say that the current production is set for what the current order rates are, correct?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it reflects incoming order rate at the higher market share that we've been able to achieve, which we're pleased about.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. And then can I ask you about the seasonality of the U.S. trucks business? I mean, it seems like since the recession, seasonality has been stronger than it was prerecession. Do you guys see that? Do you expect orders to ramp up here over the next few months as the fleet guys get ready for the '13 trucks?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, that's interesting you talked about seasonality. It's probably been dampened down a little bit since the recession because an important consideration will be the vocational market, particularly -- well, let's call it residential and commercial construction. You had some of that, I think not offset, but by the let's call it natural gas, oil. And I wouldn't call that seasonal, but that's offset it somewhat. Now as you've seen in the papers, there's some improvement and housing starts across the U.S., in particular, which is good. Still at relatively low levels, but certainly, it looks like it's off the bottom. So we're seeing a little bit more interest from some of the major construction groups in getting some new vehicles.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey that with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of detailed questions for you relative to the '13 outlook.  The comment about a prebuy in Europe, kind of widely expected. I'm just wondering what sort of magnitude you're building into that industry forecast.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. I think looking at the industry, probably in the 5% to 10% range of our total industry outlook.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in kind of just building off of Andy's question earlier, the 2013 U.S. and Canada industry sales outlook, could you comment on, not so much your production, but what you think the impact of kind of modest improvement in sales would have on the industry production given pretty sizable 2012 year-to-date industry overproduction on many measures.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think that's a -- it's a good question, sort of a relative question. I'm not sure that there's overproduction, obviously, as we've talked the last few years, and you've been asking good questions. There's a lot of older vehicles out there. I think as I see many of our customers, there's -- customers are doing well, and they're very happy with our products, and that's contributed to our growth in market share. And when I talk to them, there's a lot of interest in purchasing new vehicles. They've been, I think, more of a replacement cycle at this time. But as we have some general, slowly improving economic outlook, whether it's housing or consumer spending, I think we may see a little bit of, first, replacement of older fleets and then possibly some expansion of those fleets. The companies that are operating today, that have been around for the last decade, are very well managed. They know how to analyze the market, they've got good customer relationships, and frankly, they would like to get some of the new products that certainly we've introduced over the last 12 months.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Sure. I guess a follow-up on that. If we look at your fourth quarter production more on a daily rate as opposed to the quarter total, do you expect that probably goes up during the year?","Mark C. Pigott","You're talking about fourth quarter this year?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","We're anticipating building more trucks this quarter than last quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. I'm just wondering, based on what you're seeing in both U.S. and Canada as opposed -- as well as Europe actually, is that production in the fourth quarter kind of underproducing demand relative to what you're seeing to kind of rebuild backlogs?","Mark C. Pigott","No, we really match -- I'm not sure what our competitors do, but we really match and align our production levels with incoming orders and having a reasonable backlog of demand. So I think our production really reflects what the market is doing at least for our customers is all I can really say.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one last one for me.  There's some potential short-term tax law changes out there. When you develop your total dividend payout on any one given year, do you consider things like short-term tax law changes?","Mark C. Pigott","We certainly take into all the relevant laws out there and what will be the most beneficial for our shareholders, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is around your outlook for 2013, both U.S., Canada and Europe. Could you just talk about what kind of macro environment is encapsulated in kind of the low end of the guidance and the high end? I'm just trying to understand as we go through the year how your views might change.","Mark C. Pigott","I think on the macro side, it would very much reflect what's going on in total GDP for each of those regions, whether it's U.S., Canada, Mexico or overall in Europe. You see the headlines as well as we do, particularly in Europe, what's the next steps towards the resolution of some of the challenges throughout the eurozone. I'm not sure as the final chapter is being written, and I don't even know what's going to be in that final chapter. So that will have -- that will certainly have an impact on consumer confidence, how our customers are doing, freight demand. We follow the MAUT kilometers driven through Germany, and they're better than the last few years but certainly not at the levels of '07 and '08. That's one of the macro criteria that we track. And the good news is, I know our inventories are in very good shape, our dealers are doing well, our customers are doing well, but certainly, the macro will have a lot of impact on our business. So if people feel good, whether it's after the election, or we get the fiscal cliff behind us in one some way, shape, people feeling good, probably going to buy more and build more, and hopefully, that will drive demand for trucks.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I haven't asked this, but what's your personal view? Do you think that we will see an acceleration in economic activity post elections in Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","I am --  my job is focused on building the best trucks in the world for the greatest customers and provide those services. I want to take that off-line sometime.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Well, let me ask a different one then that you might answer. Your assessment of the prebuy in Europe, there's a lot of discussion around that, whether that would be a prebuy or there won't be a prebuy, and we haven't had any precedent for a prebuy in Europe, albeit there had been tax incentives in prior cycles. But can you talk about what are you hearing from your dealers or what are you seeing that has caused you to assume there will be a prebuy?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, talking with particularly our customers, and we saw quite a few of them at the Hannover show in the last month or so, there's a price increase of EUR 14,000, EUR 15,000, so that's real. And if you're a person operating trucks in your business, that's something you got to be thinking about. And I think that's going to be a very important consideration for a number of our customers if they want to have a prebuy. And as I think I mentioned to Andy, we're looking at maybe 5% to 10%. It's not a large prebuy if it happens. And I think your assessment is correct. There typically hasn't been too much of a prebuy. Each country takes a look at their infrastructure sort of separately and determines if they want to make any incentives for the customers to purchase greener vehicles. We'll just have to see how that shakes out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, can you talk about your expectations for your Latin America and Australia businesses in 2013? Perhaps give us an update on order trends or how you're thinking about the outlook broadly.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. Well, looking at Latin America, we'll be excluding Mercosur because we're just building our factory. The Colombia market is a very strong for us as they have transferred a lot of oil. But they're building a pipeline now, so they're just coming out with some new regulations in the country of Colombia to begin, I think, some infrastructure investment, which will be good. I think overall for the non-Mercosur, it will be maybe a little bit lower than it has been. What we're looking to do is offset that with growth. We're appointing new dealers. Our current dealers are investing in their territories. We've introduced the DAF product line in a number of countries in Latin America. So I think overall, it might be a little bit of a slower market, but we're looking to see what we can do working with our dealers who continue to deliver and get a higher share in that region. In Australia, it's been good for us. They've had a strong market and had a little bit of a slowdown but now seems to have rebounded a little bit. Australia seems -- the economy seems to be in good shape, so I think steady as she goes.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mark, is there a way to put the new locations in Latin America in their context, how many are you expecting to add dealer locations in 2013 versus where you're running now?","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, I'd say probably -- without putting a number on it, 10% to 15% more locations would be in the ballpark.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Perfect. And on capital deployment, you've just delivered major new products in the U.S. and Europe. I'm wondering if you can just provide high-level view of where you're deploying your R&D budget over the course of 2013 and the next couple of years just from a high-level standpoint.","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. As I mentioned, a milestone year this year. Great, great new products. Obviously, one of the major CapEx users next year will be building a beautiful factory in Brazil, that's ongoing; and then we have our normal cycle of new trucks being developed; and then parts warehouses, there's always lots of initiatives to keep our factories the most efficient in the industry -- R&D centers. So that's kind of the high level, but I think primarily focused on factory in Brazil, new products, engine development, pretty normal.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, your comments on the North America production schedule for the fourth quarter implies, I think, that you picked up some order share over the course of the third quarter because the industry as a whole has been outproducing orders by about 30% in the third quarter, so they probably need to cut. Is that a fair comment? You've seen the industry order numbers. Have you picked up order share in the third quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","We -- well, we picked up a little bit, but our dealers are in great shape. They're at very low inventory, and they're very excited about these new products that Kenworth and Peterbilt introduced in the Mid-America Show in March, and those are really coming into production now. So I think it's pretty steady with the third quarter, with a little bit of improvement for Peterbilt and Kenworth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J.B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to kind of square up this sort of beat a dead horse here, the Q4 outlook versus -- one of the retailers had some pretty dour comments on Q4 sales. This is just a truing up of their inventory levels, is that what it is? I mean, I think there's a coming down?","Mark C. Pigott","I don't -- I'm not sure who you're talking about and -- I know what we're doing. That's all I can really say.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe you could help us on the provision for losses in Financial Services has been coming down pretty nicely. Sort of give us some insight there.","Unknown Executive","It primarily reflects the portfolio performance as we progress through the year. Past dues at the end of last year, 1.5% for our Financial Services companies worldwide. And at the end of the third quarter, that had come down to 90 basis points. So just as Mark mentioned, our customers are performing well, and we're seeing that in the performance of our portfolio.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I know it comes out in the queue, but can you give us the breakdown between the truck sales and the part sales?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, yes. The truck sales were $2.8 billion in the third quarter, and aftermarket parts was $650 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from BMO Capital.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I guess you're not going to answer this anyway but...","Mark C. Pigott","What is it? What is it?","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you just frame for us the -- what Brazil looks like in terms of is it accretive in 2014, what kind of market share, like just so we can try to get a sense of where things are going, like how big?","Mark C. Pigott","No, it's a great question, and we're investing now, as you know. It's a $300 million investment, and I was just there a few weeks ago, and it's really shaping up, but it'll take a year to actually build the factory after we've had all the preconstruction work. So we're looking to get a few trucks out next year. And in 2014, we begin to ramp up. Of course, we're appointing dealers, and we've got some great dealers joining our team. We're looking forward to having them with us, and they're looking forward to selling DAF trucks. So 2014, we begin the ramp-up of production. I think it really has a tangible benefit in 2015, would be the pretty normal way when we're building and bringing a factory online.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then if we just wanted to think about 2015, I'm just trying to get like a normalized, early-stage revenues. Is it sort of $300 million to $500 million? I mean, you can make it as wide a range as you want, just think about it.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. I mean, 2015, our goal for the medium term is to get up to 20% share. But right now, we're starting at 0, so it's going to take some time to get there. And in 2015, why don't we say $200 million to $400 million.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then does the replacement cycle, the number of units in replacement demand go higher over the next couple of years as this big bubble of 2006 trucks come to the end of their useful life? Or is that really not affected, it's smoothed out? Do you know what I mean? [indiscernible]","Mark C. Pigott","I think they will certainly contribute to some of the demand in the marketplace, whether it's a bubble, some of those companies that purchased in 2006 may not be around anymore. Depending on what total GDP growth is, that will have an impact on how much freight is being transferred. I think it makes a contribution, whether it's a bubble or not. Well, that's hard to tell. There's a lot of great customers with products they would love to -- they'd love to trade in right now. And having just talked with many of them in the last week or 2, they're saying first half of 2013, they're going to be really taking a serious look at starting to update and upgrade their vehicles.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","How hard is it going to be for one of your competitors who's been struggling with market share when they come back to the market with their new product that's not all of a sudden the cheapest product out there anymore? How hard is it going to be for them to re-brand and to gain that share back?","Mark C. Pigott","I'm not sure. That's obviously, a great philosophical question, but we're focused on [indiscernible] It's a milestone year and best products we've ever had. We're excited about them, and dealers are in the strongest position they've been for years and years. So we're going to keep focused on what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I, too, am going to focus on what you do. I had a couple of things to ask you, and I'm trying to think a little bit about kind of mix, I guess, is a way to put as we go into 2013, the T680, 579. How much of your North American production just by order of magnitude could that be next year?","Mark C. Pigott","I'd say it could be for the whole year, obviously, we'll be looking to improve that through the year as we begin. And we're ramping up production now. For the whole year, I think 20% to 30%.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my understanding was that, that has been sort of specifically engineered to have sort of more commonality and better margins than some of your historical products. Is that accurate?","Mark C. Pigott","We -- it's a highest-quality product, the most automotive, and certainly, there have been some lower costs associated with the design. So...","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the DAF XF, can I think of that in similar terms?","Mark C. Pigott","It's -- I mean, it's the highest-quality, most-automotive product, absolutely. But it's also aligned with Euro 6. And as I indicated, there are some significant cost increases that the industry will face with Euro 6, so it's not quite the same. But a fabulous new vehicle, absolutely.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then what do you think the MX engine mix is in 2013, again, order of magnitude in the U.S., sorry.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think it will continue to improve. I'm not going to put an exact number on it. But as I indicated in my prepared comments, to have the 13-liter now be essentially 50% of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 market is a significant number. And I think that may continue to grow the 13-liter. So as we tie this, our MX engine, in with the new Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, it's a very exciting, fuel-efficient combination for our customers. So we're looking for steady growth.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are all those MX engines now coming out of Mississippi? Or are you still getting some parts of some of them or anything from Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","I think, certainly, early next year is going to be all out of Mississippi. I mean, you get parts sourced from different sections of the world, but you need to think of it essentially as a Mississippi engine.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can I assume the cost structure on an engine that comes from Mississippi is better than one that comes from Europe for you?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Yes. We're -- that's why we build it in Mississippi.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's what I thought, but I just want to make sure we're on the same page here. I appreciate that. And then my final one, just quickly.  Some speculation about pricing pressure in the North American market because of -- with a little bit of weakness we're seeing here, any comment on that?","Mark C. Pigott","I think margins for the fourth quarter will be comparable to the third quarter. And I think that's kind of reading between the lines of your question. And I think our industry is pretty straightforward. When there's a strong market and good demand, margins tend to move up. When demand slows down, whether it's macro or micro, margins tend to move down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citibank.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last one, Mark. Can you maybe just switch over to Western Europe in terms of what you're seeing there on the pricing side? I don't know if that fits into your commentary with regards to margins in the fourth quarter, but what specifically you're seeing in Western Europe, and then if we can just quantify it in terms of what the average truck sales price change was in the sales bridge. I know it comes out in the Q, but I'm wondering if you have that for the third quarter.","Mark C. Pigott","I think pricing is pretty flat in terms of -- in Europe. We're -- we've been very good. The DAF team has done a fantastic job of not only developing great products and services, but growing share. And DAF is either #1 or #2 in every market, I think except for Germany, where we're #3. And there's a lot of variables in Europe, and obviously, some of them affected the truck market in terms of what the customers are willing to pay for the product. And I think it's been relatively flat.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then back on -- you alluded to dealer inventories earlier. And I'm wondering if -- based on what it included and what we can see anyway from the cash flow statement, it looks like wholesale receivable payments exceeded investments in new loans. And obviously, that reflects a weakening sales environment. But I was wondering if we can extrapolate anything from that further in terms of dealer inventory levels, both either here or in Europe. Can you comment on that?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, the number in our cash flow statement is a year-to-date number. And so I think if you look at that for the quarter, there actually was a reduction in the amount, and we've seen dealer inventories in North America declined, dealer inventories in Europe were steady, and they are in great shape -- I mean, very well balanced with the market demand.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Right. I think it was actually a source of cash, right, in the third quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Third quarter, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","Actually, this is Andrew Buscaglia on behalf of Jamie. So I just have a quick one. Can you guys comment a little bit on your -- what you saw on material costs this quarter, and then just sort of walk through what you're thinking about it into Q4 and then potentially in 2013 as you begin your planning process?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Material have been probably relatively flat. It was in a narrow range. We've seen -- of course, we track all the major indices for raw materials, and a lot of those have gone down. The sort of worldwide demand has softened. There's been a few exceptions, but a lot of that is offset because we have -- over 75% of our supplier agreements are long term, so multiple year, which is a nice arrangement for us and our partners or our suppliers. What was your next question?","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay. And then just to clarify, so I know you said you have about 5% to 10% baked in for the prebuy in Europe. So if we don't see this come to fruition, I guess we could assume as the year progresses, maybe that your initial industry outlook might come down a little bit, or is that you're not expecting a prebuy until later in the year. Can you just talk a little about that?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think in terms of the prebuy, you're absolutely correct. That will be third, fourth quarter of next year. And what -- on the positive side, we still may achieve that range if the general economy has some improvement. Of course, reading in the press nowadays in Europe, you've got sort of limited growth for many countries. But we're also looking at gaining some share. If the macroeconomic environment in Europe does not improve, then it may have an impact on the total truck industry even if there is a prebuy. So there's a couple moving parts that have to be taken into account, depending on what's going to happen in the total market. Obviously, on a quarterly basis, we're going to be revising and updating our total industry forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm down to one question here. You've done a nice job. Some of the expenses have stepped down here recently. Do you think that's sustainable going forward? I guess what I'm getting at is in a flattish build environment in 2013, would you expect margins to be flat or up?","Mark C. Pigott","I think margins for 2013 will -- our initial look is probably flattish. One of PACCAR's strengths is excellent cost control and controlling our expenses. So we -- we're very diligent about that every single day, and we look to have a very low SG&A ratio. So I think we'll continue to focus on that every day, selling a lot more of our --- these wonderful new products we introduced this year.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So SG&A may come back up from where it's ticked down here recently, so we may expect that to come back up next year?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it's very much -- is going to be reflective of what's going on with the marketplace. We're going to be producing more units, reflecting a stronger market. SG&A will probably go up a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I had one question here on 13- versus 15-liter, and then I had a couple of housekeeping questions. So first on the 13, I guess if we were 5, 10 years in the past and I were to tell you that by today, the market would be 50% 13-liter, would you have been surprised that it progressed that quickly? And if you look 5, 10 years into the future, where do you think that breakdown will be?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I have to get you on my strategic staff here, Alex. The vast majority of the world in the truck world, 13-liter is the engine of choice. When you look at Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, it provides a good combination -- excellent combination of horsepower, torque, weight, cost, all the things you're looking for when you're operating a truck business. The -- so I think North America, U.S., Canada and Mexico are just really moving towards a reflection of what's happening in the rest of the world. And I would expect that will continue. Now there are some applications where a larger engine, a 15-liter, may have some advantages. You're talking about a lot of weight you're hauling, a very arduous operating environment. There are certainly benefits for having that larger-size engine. But for the vast majority of truck operators, 13-liter is what's driving the industry. If you're carrying -- if you have a 80,000-pound total payload in North America or 80,000-pound in Europe or Asia, it's still 80,000 pounds. And everybody has got mountains and long areas, so 13-liter is probably going to continue to grow. You've got a good combination of torque and horsepower, and it's a great engine. 5, 10 years ago, we knew it was going to transition. I think it's probably moved a little faster than the industry anticipated.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then housekeeping. I was wondering if you could give me gross margin in new trucks and aftermarket. I know you gave revenue already, but just sort of for gross margin.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. For the quarter, the truck gross margins were 7.2% and 34.5% for parts. Overall, it's 12.3%.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. It's very good. And then could I also get deliveries by region, North America, Europe, South America, slash other?","Robin E. Easton","Can we take that offline?","Mark C. Pigott","We'll take that offline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I guess, first of all, on the inventories, I might have missed it, but why exactly have the inventories grown so much year-to-date relative to the second quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think 2 areas. One is in line with the rest of the industry. We have some engine inventory anticipating the EPA 13 transition, so it's very normal. This happens every couple years as we go to a new EPA emission level. So that's a portion of it. And the other portion is some trucks, bodybuilders getting ready for delivery, that will be gone by the end of the year. That's pretty straightforward.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Now the emissions standard, the on-board diagnostics, it doesn't seem to be that expensive. Is that correct or is that a bigger price increase than I would've...","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think you're correct. It's part of the ongoing program of producing a greener and greener engine. But this one wasn't -- it's not as significant as, say, EPA 10.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then...","Mark C. Pigott","A lot of work though.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Yes, sounds like it. And then on the fourth quarter build rates, I'm sorry, I'm a little bit dense, but we're picking up a couple of weeks extra production in Europe relative to the third quarter, so does that mean that the fourth quarter production in the U.S. is going to be down 15%?","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think it should be relatively flat.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Flat. Okay. And then on Brazil, I might be looking into this a bit too closely, but has the timetable changed? It sounds like now it's late 2013, the tail-end at the year for the [indiscernible].","Mark C. Pigott","No, it's on schedule. And I think we had a good discussion a few minutes ago that in terms of having a real impact, it would be really 2015 because we'll be ramping up in 2014. But no, it's going well, and it's going to be another world-class facility. We look forward to having many of you there touring around and see what we're doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I just want to follow up in the last comment you made, Mark. You were talking about U.S. sales or production, your North America production flat, essentially Q4 versus Q3. And with your comment  about industry volume, looks like sequentially is down pretty significant double digits, if you can reconcile those 2 because it seems to be larger than just market share opportunities.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we've had -- looking at U.S., Canada, Mexico, in Mexico, which -- we've seen a little bit more of a slowdown, but U.S. and Canada is a little bit up. So overall, it's flat. And Europe is up primarily because we don't have the couple-of-weeks shutdown during our normal summer vacation schedule.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","It seems like your 215,000 U.S., Canada retail sales number would imply a fourth quarter number versus Q3 that's down.","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, well, it might reflect that. I'm really focused on what we're doing.","David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","All right. I understand. And then as we look at the -- so we've been talking about the last couple years about the increased cost for emissions and the challenge in the market of passing that on. As Navistar comes to the market with cost structure that's going to be more comparable to everybody else, do you think that's an opportunity to recoup some of those costs, or you think that's an opportunity to continue to drive share?","Mark C. Pigott","That is an excellent question, and I look forward to sharing the answer as time progresses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kristine Kubacki from Avondale Partners.","Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","I just want to ask a question about -- I guess to address a little bit -- as I perceive, a bit of a disconnect on your view between a flat market in 2013 in North America. I realize that you mentioned that customers are doing fine. But it seems like what we're hearing out of this -- at ATA and out of this earning season, both from public and private carriers, is that freight has definitely turned choppy, rates are not doing so great, and costs are going up. So I guess with all that said, and it sounds like carriers are generally thinking CapEx is going to go down and not up next year after using bonus depreciation, '11 and '12, and a softer U.S. truck market, I mean, do you think carriers are just being too cautious and they're really worried about the headwinds facing them right now and things get better? Or do you think that really that there is maybe downside risk to your estimate in 2013, and we could be looking at a down year-over-year versus flat to up?","Mark C. Pigott","The carriers are excellent. We love our customers. You know that. Having been in the industry for 35 years, what I've been able to observe, and I know that you've been tracking the industry for quite a while, so you probably know the same thing, is that if you talk with those same excellent customers in August -- I'm talking about U.S. and Canada now, freight was going up, good rates. Fuel was up but they pass that through. And there was strong discussion about, boy, 2013 really going to be great. We're going to buy a lot of trucks. Now fast forward 6 weeks and dealers are saying, \"Well, fuel has gone up a little bit more, not sure what's going to happen.\" And of course, everybody is spending a lot of time looking at the election and what's going on in their state, what's going on nationally. It is choppy, I think, to use your words. But fast forward another 6 weeks, and you can be getting a story saying, \"Things are now looking a little better. I think 2013 is going to be good.\" So what that says is when things are going well, a lot of people will think that it's always going to go well. When things are not going as well, a lot of you will think it's never going to get better. What I found is that what makes this industry so much fun is that there is a cyclicality to it. Sometimes, that's measured in decades, years or months. I think with the customers doing well, and you've seen many of them have reported in the last week or 2, some of them have increased their profits, some have lowered their profits, but most have made a profit, which is the most important thing. Dealers doing very, very well, strong absorption; parts and service business good; finance, good, and lay the overarching opportunity of having a very old truck fleet, whether it's 6, 7 or 8 years, and you can get any of those numbers depending on who you're talking to, I think with some growth, housing market, general GDP, consumers feeling a little bit better, I think it could be a reasonable year next year. It's the way I look at it.","Kristine Kubacki - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. Maybe if we get the right outcome in the election there as opposed to [indiscernible].","Mark C. Pigott","Election -- it's always -- it's obviously -- every election is important for us, but at the end of the day, we've seen strong markets with all sorts of different types of leadership in Washington, D.C. When you talk with a truck, and it doesn't talk much, but if it's 8 years old, it knows it wants to get replaced. That's what we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to follow up on the last question. Most of my other questions have been answered. But when you guys updated your Q3 guide in September, it was looking like your inquiries were actually tracking up pretty nicely, sequentially. When we look at the industry orders, they haven't really seen a pickup there. How are the inquiries tracking now? And do you really -- is there a disconnect? I mean, are the customers really still kind of hitting you to kind of get quotes and you really think that if things do improve, you can really see the orders really get on the books really quickly?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think as we've said, really for North America, we see Q4, Q3 pretty comparable, pretty steady. And as we look at net orders on a quarterly basis through the year, there certainly for the industry has seen a slowdown. And third quarter, the industry adjusted their builds down from the second quarter. But you also have to lay in, as you know, we've been able to pick up a couple points of share because of the great dealers and great products we have. So if things get good again, the industry could certainly deliver. If things continue as they are, I think everybody has pretty much adjusted their production to reflect this build rate. So the guidance we gave for third quarter, we're another quarter smarter now. I think right now, we're looking at, as I said, perhaps 1% to 2% increased truck deliveries, production for us in the fourth quarter. And next year, I think could be slightly better both in North America and in Europe","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I mean, most of the good questions have been asked here at this point. So if it's okay, Mark, I just want to get a clarification and then kind of an open-ended question here. You made a comment a couple times that you're expecting to sell another 1% or 2% more with flat margins. Are we talking margin dollars or margin percentages here?","Mark C. Pigott","Percent.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Percent? Okay. And we're talking about evolution in the truck market, and you were talking about the 13- versus 15-liter. Can I get your thoughts on the adoption rate of natural gas engines?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. There's been several very well-attended and I think excellent speakers at a number of natural gas conferences over the last few months, and we've been involved with a number of them. This is a great industry because, in many ways, we're really a leader and on particularly a lot of the environmental aspects. If you go back a number of years and start with hybrids. And I think on the car side, probably the Toyota Prius gets most of the credit for pioneering that, and I think they're still the largest seller of hybrid cars I think worldwide. There are a lot of discussion about how fast would hybrids take over, and you could read lots of different press and they throw a lot of numbers out. At the end of the day, it's still only 1% to 2% at that. And there's a lot of reasons why it's not higher, but that's what it is. It's an interesting statistic, and I think it's accurate, but you can never tell that. Less than 25% of all hybrid owners buy another one. Okay, what does that mean? I think if you look at, say, Apple computers, probably something over 90% buy another Apple computer. So the whole press got excited about it, and it's still good, and we still sell hybrid. And a number of our customers have great benefit from it, then it goes into the electric introduction. And whether it's our government or other groups saying you're going to pour billions of dollars into electric cars -- and there are certainly some real benefits to it. But the early projections of strong growth, it have not materialized, and there've been obviously a lot of -- more challenges. A number of companies have gone out of business, and the demand has not been there. Natural gas, 5 years ago, there was not a lot of discussion about it. And now I think, particularly for the United States, there's a great discussion about being energy-independent, which is wonderful, but you didn't see too many articles about the U.S. being energy-independent 5 or 10 years ago. But now we're talking about it, which is great. Natural gas, I'm very proud that particularly the Kenworth and Peterbilt teams are the market leaders. 40% of all natural gas heavy trucks are Kenworth or Peterbilt. We're a real leader in things like the waste haulage industry, but other industries. Certainly, lots of press, lots of investment, lots of states have benefited from it. What is the long-term benefit or what's the long-term growth in natural gas? I think like these other 2, the hybrid, the electric, there's numbers of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% of the market will have it at some time period. We're not seeing it now. Maybe we'll see it in the future. Irregardless of what the market share is, I would expect that PACCAR will be one of the leaders in that marketplace.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So one question on the U.S., outside of the biggest fleet, have you noticed any issues with -- I don't want to say exactly getting financing, but because fleets have stretched out trucks, they may have a lower down payment available over your lower value of the trade-in. The used values are high. Obviously, the trade-in may just be older and worth less. Have you seen -- is there any concern that the bigger fleets have the firepower to keep going and the medium-size fleets don't? Is that an issue for you guys next year, you think?","Mark C. Pigott","I don't think so. I think we've seen pretty readily available credit for our customers that want to buy trucks really in all of our markets at this point. So credit availability has not been an issue.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Perfect. And then I don't know if you can find a way to answer or opine on this one, or you want to or not, but a lot of us have been a little bit puzzled with not so much PACCAR build rates in North America, but industry build rates, which have come in but maybe were a little slow to come in. Do you feel like there is any inventory overhang? And do you feel like that has the potential to affect pricing or not?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think our dealers, our customers are in very good shape. If you're building a product and indicating it'll do X, Y and Z. And then for whatever reason, it doesn't do X, Y and Z, it causes challenges within your system, and that's maybe what you're hearing from competitors.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes. Okay. And well -- and just build rates were slow to come down among -- well, okay, I'll think about that for a minute. So just in general, are you able to comment on where you think pricing environment is robust at this point as it was last year?","Mark C. Pigott","I think -- the pricing environment for our industry is probably more robust in the first 6 months of this year. And that has probably moderated in the last 6 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Quick question on European orders. I realized that you're keeping production rates there -- you're raising production in the fourth quarter. But can you talk about the order intake during the quarter? A lot of your large European competitors, pretty substantial drops around 20%. Can you comment on how you did relative to that?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, our orders are pretty steady. For DAF trucks, they're steady. We're seeing some growth in Russia. It's a market that's really starting to gather some traction. And of course, we sell also in the Middle East; we're growing in Africa; and the joint venture in -- joint venture assembly agreement in Morocco. And throughout Western Europe, it's obviously down from a couple years ago but steady. And then Central Europe, we see that as some areas that are growing. So overall, pretty steady for DAF.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And one question in the U.S. With the fuel economy standards coming in, in 2014, some of the OEMS have talked about introducing trucks that meet those early -- as early as the next couple months. Can you comment on your plans for that?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we've -- are you talking about greenhouse gas and others?","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Right.","Mark C. Pigott","We have been approved by the EPA for some of our vocational vehicles, and so that's good. That was done earlier this month. So yes, like everyone else, we're working on it and I think are in very good shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Sheridan [ph] from Longbow Capital.","Unknown Analyst","My questions have been answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christian Frens [ph] from TIAA-CREF.","Unknown Analyst","Just 3 quick questions on my part. Just going back to the build rate issue, which I think has been asked a couple of times already. So just to help me reconcile the ACT [ph] data which shows build rates in excess of order rates for the industry and I think would imply that industry production comes down in Q4. First of all, do you agree on that view for the industry? And then is PACCAR different effectively because of share gains and maybe EPA 13 or what have you? Just wanted to know if you could expand on that. And then I have 2 follow-up questions.","Mark C. Pigott","I think as we've shared the -- kind of with the Peterbilt in U.S. and Canada, comparable fourth quarter, third quarter; Mexico, slightly down, I can't really expound on what went into the ACT [ph] numbers. What's your next thought?","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And the next question is very brief. Just your financial sub. How should do -- how should we expect assets to grow into the final quarter of the year?","Mark C. Pigott","Assets?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, for the final quarter.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I think there'll be a slight uptick probably as we progress through the rest of the quarter. A lot of customers will be entering financing vehicles to take advantage of the tax benefits at the end of the year.","Unknown Analyst","The slight uptick being a couple of percentage points, single digit that you're seeing?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, something like that. Yes.","Unknown Analyst","And then lastly, just on European demand and the prebuy discussion, I guess 2 things here. First of all, I was wondering whether you could clarify a little bit what -- specifically for Germany, what type of incentives or early adoption incentives Germany has this year, and how that compares to the last time round? And then second of all, I was just listening to the Scania call the other day, and they saw a weak Europe in September, specifically it was mentioned. They also mentioned that the Middle East was turning down. So I don't know if you could care to -- I'm just wondering why it seems that your view is a little bit different, or am I missing something here?","Mark C. Pigott","I think Germany actually had an announcement during the Hannover show which they were having lower incentive levels, so that's all we can -- and you're probably at the show, so that's all we can really comment on that. In terms of what our competitors are seeing, I don't really know. I mean we can track what their market share is, and you can derive an answer from that. In terms of the Middle East, yes, it might be slowing down. But the good news for us is that we are a relatively small player, so we see some incremental growth opportunity, which is good for DAF.","Unknown Analyst","And you didn't see September drop in Europe, a significant weakening?","Mark C. Pigott","That was -- that's in the third quarter, that's behind us. We're looking forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Pickels from Manning & Napier.","Robert F. Pickels - Manning & Napier Advisors, LLC","Just a quick strategy question. In Brazil, it looks like your plan is to sort of build your own facilities and kind of organically try to penetrate that market. And it seems a little bit different strategy than some of the other efforts you've made maybe in Europe, where you maybe made some acquisitions. Can you just talk about that strategy, why you chose to build versus buy, or how that might change over time, or just anything you can provide on that would be great.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Good question. I didn't know there was anybody available to purchase in Brazil. They typically are a division of a larger corporate entity. So I don't think any of those were actually for sale. Second, we've got -- or we're considered the best product in the world, we're bringing the DAF product in there, and you've seen the wonderful success that DAF, through it's products and its dealers and its customers, have enjoyed over the last 15-plus years, and we're looking to certainly build on that. And we've got a great group of world-class suppliers in Brazil that are enthusiastic about us beginning to manufacture in-country. And we're also really able to take advantage of a new group of dealers who have experience in-country that are excited about being able to sell the DAF products. So it seems to be a very logical choice as to grow organically in Brazil, in all of South America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Satish Athavale from KSA Capital.","Satish Athavale","Mark, can you comment on the cadence of production and sales expectations for first half versus second half next year?","Mark C.

Mr. Hastings please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We'd like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations and joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; Preston Feight, Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode.

A summary of risks and uncertainties is described in more detail in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Preston Feight, and I will update you on our excellent third quarter results. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.8 billion and third quarter net income was $545 million, a strong 9.5% after tax return on revenue. Revenues were 14% higher and net income was 35% higher within the third quarter last year.","PACCAR's Truck Division's produced a record number of trucks in the third quarter and PACCAR Parts achieved 14% revenue growth compared to the third quarter last year. I am extremely proud of our 28,000 employees who have delivered the world's highest quality Trucks, Parts, and Financial Services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR delivered 47,800 trucks during the third quarter, 3% higher than the second quarter. Increased build rates in North America were partially offset by fewer build days in Europe due to DAF's regular summer shutdown.","Truck and Parts' gross margins were 14.1% in the third quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization comparable to the second quarter at about 3%. Costs were impacted by parts shortages from a small number of North American suppliers, including a few affected by Hurricane, Florence. As a result of these part shortages, we incurred additional material and labor costs.","Our Tier 1 suppliers are investing in additional capacity and working closely with Tier 2 suppliers to meet PACCAR factory delivery requirements. We expect this situation to normalize in the near term.","Our Peterbilt and Kenworth teams in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico did a fantastic job of managing record third quarter production and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry.","In the fourth quarter, we're expecting 4% to 8% higher deliveries compared to the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of production days in Europe and higher daily build rates. Truck and Parts gross margins are estimated to be higher in the fourth quarter at around 14.5%. Preston Feight will now provide an update on DAF, PACCAR Parts, and PACCAR Financial Services.","Preston Feight","Thanks Ron. Our 2018 forecast is for Europe's greater than 16 tonne market to be in the range of 310,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting continued strong demand in growing European economies. We expect 2019 to be another excellent year with the market in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. The eurozone's GDP growth expectation for this year is 2% with 2019 projected at a similar level. Freight transport activity on German highways is at record levels up 3.5% this year.","DAF has had an incredible year in 2018. DAF XF and CF trucks which were honored as international truck of the year 2018 achieved European above 16 tonne market share of 16.6% year-to-date compared to 15.1% in the same period last year. DAF is making great progress towards its goal of 20% share.","PACCAR's Parts business generated strong quarterly revenues of $960 million, 14% higher than the same period last year. Parts quarterly pretax income was $189 million, 24% higher than last year. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer focus technologies drove these results.","We are pleased to have opened our new 160,000 square foot parts distribution center in Toronto this month. We expect part sales to grow an additional 5% to 8% next year.","PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income increased 12% to $79 million compared to $71 million a year ago. The portfolio which was a record $14.1 billion this quarter continued to perform well.","Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 used truck values increased more than 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles.","PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services profit contributions are much larger than they were 15 years ago. These businesses are inherently less cyclical than the sale of new trucks and their consistent profitability enhances PACCAR's financial results throughout the business cycle.","Harry Schippers will now provide an update on Kenworth and Peterbilt and PACCAR investments.","Harrie Schippers","Thanks, Preston. We have raised our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck markets to a range of 280,000 to 290,000 units. In 2019, we expect the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck markets to expand further to a range of 280,000 to 310,000 vehicles.","U.S. economic and freight indicators are very strong with 3% GDP growth and nearly 4% industrial production growth expected this year. Freight tonnage growth has been a robust 7.5% year-to-date. We head into 2019 with great momentum, including the industry's best products and factory visibility that extends into the second half of next year.","The record truck orders this year are driven by a strong economy. In the past, the surge in orders was often driven by a pre-buy related to an emissions change. Customers across all segments are experiencing strong demand from growing freight volume, very high fleet utilization and strong pricing.","Customers are also benefiting from the industry leading operating efficiency provided by DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks, as well as superior aftermarket support from PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services.","PACCAR is creating innovative products and technologies for the future. DAF showcased several advanced powertrain vehicles at the IAA truck show last month. The DAF CF Electric, LF Electric and CF hybrid trucks are entering field testing with customers. We look forward to customer demands for electric and hybrid powertrains in certain applications such as refuse, urban delivery and product operations.","Longer term, electric vehicles will be competitive in more applications. While we are preparing for the long-term by making investments in alternative powertrain technologies, we do expect diesel to remain the most efficient powertrain technology in heavy truck applications for the foreseeable future. We estimate capital spending of $425 million to $475 million and R&D expenses of $300 million to $310 million this year.","In 2019, we are planning for increased capital investment of $525 million to $575 million and increased R&D expenses of $300 million to $330 million. These investments will develop the next generation of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks and enhance PACCAR's diesel and alternative powertrain technologies and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.","During the third quarter, we repurchased $59 million of PACCAR stock, with $241 million remaining of the $300 million authorization approved by the PACCAR board in July.","Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Tiss","While, I am little shocked here, I usually don't even get on. How are you?","Ron Armstrong","We love you.","Joel Tiss","Yeah. So can you just explain maybe philosophically the gap between very strong truck shipments and the driver shortages? And is that kind of setting up cancellations in the future or how are all these fleets absorbing all these new trucks?","Ron Armstrong","I think they're - the number of trucks is it's not at sort of historical peak levels, but it's strong and they're getting the increased operating efficiencies. And we've seen, you know, there's additional demand, we've seen more used trucks also being sold and the utilization of the fleets now are at record levels. So they really show no issues of being able to absorb the trucks, and I think what we hear is that there would be even more trucks purchased if there were drivers to put in the seats.","Joel Tiss","And then can you like help us maybe look forward a little bit and there's some new emission standards coming and then there's a particle emission standard coming in 2023. Is there enough sort of advancements and changes that are likely to come, say over the next five years to kind of keep the run rate of truck demand at a higher level or do you think the normal cyclicality that we see especially in North America is going to be more the way that the next five years look?","Ron Armstrong","I think the capability of engines for the last couple of iterations has been to improve fuel efficiency which translates into lower total operating costs for our customers and that won't change. As we look forward, we have greenhouse gas reductions in 2021, 2024 and 2027 in North America. Europe is close to proposing some limitations beginning in 2025 and 2030. So, we're going to continue to innovate and improve the efficiency of the diesel engines for the foreseeable future.","In addition, obviously we're working on alternative powertrains and those will be attractive for certain applications, which I think Harrie mentioned those in his comments that, applications like refuse ports et cetera there could be a reasonable business case for those particular applications.","Joel Tiss","And then, sorry just last one. So do you think that those forces are strong enough to be able to change the shape of the historic cycle or it's not a fair question?","Ron Armstrong","Well, it's -\u2013 I think in the past cycles, we're very much focused on sued and NOx emissions with no benefits for our customers. So future cycles or future emissions legislates are greenhouse gas reduction. So there will be cost increases for new technology to be added, but it brings a benefit for our customers to enjoy.","Joel Tiss","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Ron Armstrong","Thanks, Joel.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning, good afternoon.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Can you folks talk about where the supply base stands today in terms of catching up with the really robust order cycle we've had and at which point, do you expect industry lead times to try to stabilize and maybe start to come down towards your historical target 10 to 12-week lead times?","Ron Armstrong","I think from my perspective the supply base is making progress. As I mentioned, they're making some investments working with all levels of the supply base Tier 1, Tier 2. The Hurricane Florence we have a couple of suppliers who are located in the Carolinas. And unfortunately, due to the time they had to take the shut down and some of the impacts of floods et cetera that had an impact.","And so we're working through each one of those and we are as I said we expect in the near-term we'll work through those. I had a discussion with one of our suppliers yesterday. A good discussion, good healthy discussion and so everybody's got the same interest at heart. So we'll work probably during this quarter.","Jerry Revich","And so from a margin standpoint you folks had margin in the high 14% range at the gross margin line and the first half of 2018. Once you work through those supply chain issues, can you get back towards that level of gross margin performance that we saw in the first half of this year before the supply chain issue started to play out?","Ron Armstrong","I think with certainly that the possibility is there Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then your retail market share is up significantly in Europe. Can you just give us a sense for where your orders market share is tracking, is that retail momentum set to continue based on how the orders look heading into the fourth quarter?","Ron Armstrong","We don't get quarter market data. We only know what we have done. The DAF quarter percentage has been strong this year with the year-over-year increases. And so we had ended next year with a good solid backlog and expect to be able to continue at our current pace for the - at least for the near term.","Jerry Revich","And lastly can you talk about how - if a significant know input supply basis from China for your sourcing strategy. And whether we should expect a pickup in inflation in early 2019 as the tariffs move to 25% from 10%?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah, our team has done a good job of evaluating the impacts of tariffs and other trade arrangements. And I would tell you that the effect is hundreds of dollars per truck.","And so it's not a major item, but it's something obviously that just like other cost increases that where we manage that into our costing and pricing projections and work with that with our customers on future deliveries.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","Ann Duignan","I have to dig in, find a few questions remaining. Can you talk a little bit about - we had heard during the quarter that a lot of dealers were ordering for inventory because lead times were extending, not necessarily PACCAR's dealers, although one of them was a PACCAR's, but Kenworth dealer.","Can you talk a little more about where your dealer inventories are versus maybe historical norm and is there and risk that they are ordering to inventory and that could cause significant downturn when the market rolls over?","Ron Armstrong","We're really in good shape dealer inventory wise. I think we comment historically that if we're in the 60 day range in terms of inventory plus or minus and that's right where we were at in North America, as well as in Europe. So, the dealer inventories are in excellent shape as we sit here today.","Ann Duignan","Okay. That's good to hear. I appreciate that. And then specifically on the margin, gross margin for Q4, I know once you get all these supply chain issues resolved, the probability is that as long as volumes are, gross margins will go back to the 14.5% to 15%. But specifically for Q4, should we anticipate that supply chain issues will still weigh on gross margins? Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. At this point, we think something around 14.5% is probably a reasonable expectation for the fourth quarter.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I'll leave it there. And get back in queue. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Okay. Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Potter","Hi, guys. Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment, there has been a couple of announcements recently I'm sure you're aware of FDR, catalyst and things of this nature degrading over time. Just wanted to see what your confidence is that there won't be any charges coming from PACCAR projecting similar issues?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah, we're not aware of a similar deterioration effect in our after treatment. But that's on - subject to ongoing testing and there's no assurance, but at this point, we're - we feel good about our approach and our - the chemistry that we've used in our after treatment system.","Alex Potter","Okay. It's good to hear. Tax rate was a bit lower in the quarter, I was just wondering if you should provide any guidance regarding what we should be modeling for the next quarter and year I guess?","Ron Armstrong","I think Michael can address that.","Michael Barkley","Yes. We have a couple of positive one-time items in the quarter that we don't expect to repeat. So you should expect a range of 22% to 23% going forward.","Alex Potter","Okay. That's very helpful. And then last one, I guess, if you could just comment on you mentioned that the portfolio is still doing very well with the FinCo used vehicle pricing is doing okay. It looks like if you could just provide maybe first of all over the next year we've got a changing interest rate environment any commentary you might give around those likely performance of that segment would be helpful?","Michael Barkley","Yeah. As long as the freight demand is there and we're at record levels of freight activity in both North America and Europe that obviously provides a great opportunity for our customers to earn a profit. And we're seeing the past dues continue to be at about 50 basis points really historical low levels.","So, there's nothing that we see in the near term that is going to impact the performance of the portfolio. We've - our teams continue to exercise very prudent credit underwriting and taking advantage of data analytics tools to continue to enhance the capability on the way forward.","Alex Potter","Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys.","Michael Barkley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thanks. This is Brandon on first Seth. Just going back to your dealer inventories, are you doing anything extra vetting or anything like that to discourage any double ordering there?","Ron Armstrong","No. We monitor the level of order intake for customer orders or stock orders, and so our divisions are very adept at sort of managing that and ensuring that what we have in the backlog is buildable [ph] to the best extent that we can.","Harrie Schippers","Any other thing we're doing is we're making sure that the customers are putting deposits down on vehicles so we understand the relationship to the customers well enough to know when is a serious order or not a serious order. So we're carefully managing the firmness of the backlog.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And I apologize if I've missed this, but could you give a color on your outlook for the Brazilian market and what's happening with your market share there?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. The market share continues to tick up. We've progressively increased build rates throughout this year. We have one more increase coming in the month of December. And so we're going to deliver about 2300 trucks this year and that the build rate that we'll in end this year, there's no reason at this point to say that that won't progress. We'll probably deliver over 3000 trucks next year and so from a market perspective Ken you have some.","Ken Hastings","Yes. Yeah, I do. So for 2018 the above 16-tonne truck market we expect to be 45,000 to 55,000 vehicles and next year we're expecting 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning out there.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning, Andy","Andy Casey","Just wanted to take your temperature there, the really strong order intake that we've seen, how far into 2019 are your lead times, we're hearing some of the products are quite extended. And if we assume supply chain normalization occurs, how quickly do you think some of those lead times can be reduced?","Ron Armstrong","The backlog is extended. It's longer than it has been for some time. And as we always do we work closely with our suppliers to manage their capabilities, our capabilities, so that we get the right support of our customers and we can meet their delivery needs.","So it's the clarity of sort of how that progresses is a little bit fuzzy at this point, but I suspect supply base will continue to improve its capability to deliver in the coming months for sure.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks, Ron. And I think it may have been Preston talking about deposits for orders to manage the firmness of the backlog. Is that something PACCAR has done in the past?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. We do some of that and then we also - there's a cancellation policy that we put into effect that cancellation fee that is there to require that orders are buildable and more firm.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thanks. And then just on pricing first on Truck and then on Parts. Are the orders given that you've taken deposits and you have that cancellation fee, are the orders in backlog price protected or for some of these orders that are way out can you actually increase prices?","Ron Armstrong","We typically - we've got a commitment at a price. We've factored in our best estimate of what we think future costs are going to look like when we deliver those trucks. And so we have a pretty good feel about what we think the realization will be when we deliver those trucks.","Harrie Schippers","And we have a price again in place for the first half of next year for North America. And like we said the backlog is already extending into the second half of next year. So with the pricing, cancellation fees, we feel clearly confident that dealers will only put in those orders that they really need.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you, Harrie. And then skipping over to Parts. I mean, the tariff impact if it's going to impact anything, maybe it's there, but should we think about any increases that you may see within the Parts' portfolio? Should we expect that just to be offset by pricing? And if so, how much of the - I believe I heard 5% to 8% growth in 2019 is unit volume.","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I'd say most of that is unit volume growth and our teams look very closely at the components that are affected by tariffs and manage that. Our expectation is generally that will be passed on to the market.","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess a couple of questions. One, obviously the market is very concerned that truck is peaking, the stocks are pricing that in and then you made a comment earlier people probably under appreciate your Parts contribution et cetera. So is there any way you can help us frame if you're thinking about sort of potentially the next downturn in earnings?","What are the factors that would allow PACCAR to contribute - I'm sorry to earn-up higher trough relative to where we were? And how do you think about share repurchase in that context, just given where your stock is today versus your view on the market?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think our factories we continue to make investments in our facilities to improve efficiency. You've been to our factories. You know the efficiency that we have in our factories and we continue to try and move the needle to manage our costs - the lowest cost manufacturer during all phases of the cycle. So that doesn't change and we'll continue to make those investments.","Obviously the lower tax rate has a significant incremental effect on earnings versus a 31% rate historically versus a 22% to 23% rate. Currently that changes a little bit depending on where the earnings come from, but that's a significant enhancement from what we've seen historically.","Parts and finance are making sizable contributions to the profitability of our operations. So we excel during the cycles and we will continue to excel. We can manage our cost structure better than anybody in the industry.","Jamie Cook","Okay. And then just when you talk about - I know you have fairly good visibility extending into beyond the second half of 2019 or whatever. I mean, is that fairly broad based small versus large fleets or occasional? Can you just talk about if it's broad-based or specific to sort of one type of customer?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it is broad based. I mean, obviously the fleets are probably better at getting their orders in earlier and there's probably some smaller guys that will come. And so - but our teams are closely matching backlog to make sure that we meet the needs of all of our customers from small to - sort of smallest to the biggest.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","Hi, good morning, guys.","Ron Armstrong","Hi, Steve.","Steve Volkmann","Most of my questions have been answered. But I wonder if you have a sense of the supplier issue that you saw in the quarter. Any broad sense of what that might have impacted your gross margin?","Ron Armstrong","You know, it's one of those deals that it's really tough to - some things you can quantify specifically others are a little bit vague. But I have a guess probably 50 basis points would be the effect on the overall margin for the third quarter.","And so yes, it was significant. Our teams did a great job sort of managing the schedule and managing the offline flow in our factories, and we're still managing through that, but I think we're seeing our way through the end of the tunnel.","Steve Volkmann","Okay, super. And then as we look out into 2019 and even though maybe people are starting to think about what the downturn would look like, it seems like the 2019 outlook is actually up a bit. And I'm curious how you think we should think about profitability.","Can you grow gross margin with a little more volume and maybe a little last supplier issues and so forth or should we think more in the sense of gross margin being kind of flat and then you'll lever on SG&A?","Ron Armstrong","I think all those things are possible and so as we think about next year something probably in the 14% to 15% range for overall total gross margin is sort of where our heads are at currently.","Steve Volkmann","Okay. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Ron Armstrong","Good afternoon.","Steven Fisher","Just a couple of questions on Europe. Can you give us a little more color on the European region? Curious what your order trends are looking like, if we segment the Europe into Eastern Europe, Continental Western and then U.K.?","Ron Armstrong","Sure. Just talking about Europe for a second the 16.6% share is again a record. Where we're seeing growth is pretty uniform. We're seeing growth throughout we've - with a couple of points we'd become the leading import brand in Germany which is roughly 20% of the European markets so that's nice accomplishment by the team in Europe.","We're also seeing Eastern Europe grow as even more important part of the sector and DAF is very strong there. We're a market leader in several countries in Eastern Europe with growing share year-over-year sometimes 2% to 3% and 4%. So as the total of Europe evolves and matures DAF is really well positioned for strong growth in the future.","Steven Fisher","And U.K. if you could comment on that?","Ron Armstrong","Well, the U.K. we're the market leader in the U.K. We'll continue to be the market leader. Obviously, there's some dynamics in U.K. with the general economy, but we continue to be strong in the U.K. as well, which is down as a percentage of the total market.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then related to Brexit, how much of your European production would you say is in the U.K. maybe on a year-to-date basis? And how much is exported to Continental Europe?","And if we ended up with a hard break scenario what would you do to manage that? Would you consider relocating any production?","Ron Armstrong","We have great flexibility. It's one of our real strengths. So we're able to produce a full range of products that we make in our factory in U.K. at Leyland which is something that was a unique advantage for us. So we can make those medium duties as well as all the heavy duties in the U.K.","So we're well positioned for any kind of scenarios that would happen hard or soft. And then, we have great obviously manufacturing capacities in our main plants at Eindhoven. So we're watching what's happening there, but we feel very well positioned.","Harrie Schippers","Yeah. When I was over there several weeks ago at Preston I met with the team and really had a good discussion about of what the range of outcomes could be. And so we are prepared to manage that whatever the outcome might be.","Steven Fisher","Okay. I'll follow up there. And then just one last clarification on the emissions degradation, are you guys using the same suppliers that your European peer is that announced their issues?","Harrie Schippers","No, no.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Harrie Schippers","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ross Gilardi","Good morning. Hey, guys.","Ron Armstrong","Hey, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Hey, Ron. Just had kind of a philosophical question I mean, most of my questions have been answered but to me PACCAR has been an outstanding stock over the long-term but in the last five years you've got earnings double and you continue to establish all sorts of internal records.","You've got an extremely robust cycle right now and the stock is essentially flat even if we ignored today's move. So what is the market missing about PACCAR? And does the stock performance influence how you look at the business or your strategy? And more importantly, how do you drive value on the stock from here?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I think we just continue to - we're record truck deliveries record; truck revenues record, product revenues record, financial services portfolio our focus is to continue to grow the company and grow the earnings over the long-term and that will pay-off eventually.","You probably know more about why today is what it is in the market. It doesn't make any sense to us but we're going to continue to focus on what we do, how we do it, and execute better than anybody in the industry.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And just curious anything in your North American business? I mean you never seen the oil service companies talk about at least a temporary slowdown in the Permian.","Are you seeing any slowdown at your Gulf Coast dealers at all due to what's going on down there? Any granularity in order trends in that region?","Ron Armstrong","Ross we've not seen anything like that. I mean again oil affects a small percentage of our total truck production and overall business. So, it's not something that we monitor that closely, but I think the Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks, we have great customers in the oilfield and we're continuing to see steady - pretty steady demand I think from those customers. So not much impact.","Oil prices have rebounded nicely and so I think that bodes well for the mid-term for that segment and it also has a nice benefit for our Winch business.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Thanks, Ron.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Thanks, guys. Just curious - obviously, you're working through some of these part shortages currently. But if we think about your guidance for next year or the industry guidance for North America, your truck retail sales kind of coming in at the high end. What are the other bottlenecks we need to be thinking about in terms of getting your build rates higher to meet that increased level in demand that we could potentially see next year?","Ron Armstrong","I think right now suppliers are the pacing item. And we're - again, we are working closely on additional investments and that is the item that will make the difference for us.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. And just to make sure that I fully understand the view is that is a near-term issue that will be fixed by the end of the fourth quarter?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. That's our goal for sure. And our supplier - we have great suppliers and again, some were dealt some pretty difficult hands with a hurricane affecting their operations and so that's - again, it's all temporary and it can be worked through.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then also just thinking about the pricing environment heading into next year. I think I believe you said this quarter it was pretty similar to last quarter. Can you just give us any sense of, kind of, how you guys are thinking about the pricing environment?","Ron Armstrong","I would say steady. A lot of orders taken and negotiated with many of our customers. And so I think we feel good about the direction of pricing. It's very reasonable for the current market circumstances so.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Raso","Hi. Thank you. Just quick question really more for my modeling. I'm trying to understand why the deliveries were up 19%, but the Truck revenues were only up 14.5%? It's been a little while since the Truck revenues were below the deliveries.","So, first of all I would say, well, maybe it's the mix geographically, but really your best growth rates were in some of the higher price point trucks, right North America, Europe. Is there something within the mix of the size of the trucks, type of trucks that went out that would have the deliveries up that much more than the revenue growth you booked?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, Michael has some thoughts that he could share on that.","Michael Barkley","Right. You'll probably notice that in Europe our deliveries were up 14%, 15% and truck revenues were down and that's mostly due to we had more truck sales that were deferred because they were associated with guaranteed residual value contracts, which resulted in us deferring the sales revenues over the term of the residual value guarantee, and so that just worked out this quarter to be in effect that was noticeable.","David Raso","And what's the reason why it was greater? And maybe if you could help us frame it for us a little bit how much greater than normal the percentage of trucks that went out in Europe with the deferred?","Michael Barkley","Yeah, I think typically David that just really a function of the particular customers that you're doing business with at any particular quarter. Preston, do you have anything?","Preston Feight","Yeah, I would just say it's timing. And we've grown in the large fleets. We talked earlier in the call about fleet growth Eastern Europe and DAF is doing a good job of making penetrations and some of those large fleets come with JRVs, but largely it's timing.","David Raso","Okay. So yeah, even when we're in Germany, like the idea of your market share are higher in some of the Eastern European countries, some of the bigger logistics truck companies or the ones getting share out of that region. That this is reflective of that essentially?","Preston Feight","Yes.","Preston Feight","I think you're starting to see that the DAF trucks in Europe they have the best fuel economy, the lowest operating cost and that's having the biggest fleets taking a really good at us and we're winning share there.","David Raso","And one of the element currency and I apologize I jumped on late, have you given the exact currency impact for the quarter?","Preston Feight","Yeah. The currency impact for the quarter with respect to revenues is about $50 million or so of reduction of revenues due to currency movements. The dollar was strong during the quarter compared to last year and impact on income this quarter was pretty minimal.","David Raso","And that was 50 or 15?","Preston Feight","50.","David Raso","50. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Preston Feight","You bet. Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open.","Joe Vruwink","Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Ron Armstrong","Hi, Joe.","Joe Vruwink","Just one question for me. Everything on the call sounded really positive and the industry is doing well. So what if anything, are you worried about as you look into 2019?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah, the backlogs and the business conditions are very good. So we feel really good about, like I said we're at record levels in all of our segments and our focus is to continue to grow, take advantage of the current market opportunities. So I'd say there's not any major concerns on our horizon.","Preston Feight","Trucks are performing great. And all our customers are very happy with the trucks that they are buying, pretty good position to be in.","Joe Vruwink","When you - maybe I'll throw one idea out there, when you look at pricing trends and the spot market and how that ultimately flows into your customers' core rates, there's definitely been some moderation there so, when you think about orders that have been in place Q3, Q4 of this year and you think about your customers pricing maybe moderating from the high levels it's been at, does that give you a cause for concern? Or if there's any headwind from that dynamic maybe it's more of a late 2019 phenomenon ultimately?","Ron Armstrong","So, yeah, the Financial Services portfolio has been at less than 1% past dues for about six consecutive years. And that was during periods of really strong freight markets down to maybe not so strong freight markets. So I don't see that the customer's ability to meet their obligations is going to be significantly affected by some moderate reduction in pricing in the freight market. It's just been extraordinarily good in the last six months. And so I don't see that being a factor in our customer's decisions to buy trucks or being able to meet their commitment.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie. Your line is open.","Sameer Rathod","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just one quick question on wage and wage pressure. Are you guys seeing any lack of availability in terms of hiring people versus any increases in wages that you have to pay in the tight market? Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","We just have - we have great facilities. We have great reputations in the communities in which our factories and warehouses are located. We probably have some of the longest tenured employees in the industry that work in our operations. And so, when we have a need for employees, we'll probably get 10 apps for every job that we post. So we're viewed as a premium employer in the markets that we're in. And so we're able to find the people we need to do our staffing.","That being said there are some pockets where that's part of the suppliers' challenge is getting employees in some of the areas in which they are in and so again they're working through that to try and solve those challenges.","Sameer Rathod","Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","Joe O'Dea","First just talking about gross margins next year in the 14% to 15% range and kind of in line with where you are this year and then thinking about what looks like a setup for some tailwinds on price, supply chain issues, abating mix that looks like if anything it's a bit of a benefit on stronger North America. And so what's some of the kind of offsets to that might be such that we don't see year-over-year margin expansion?","Ron Armstrong","If all those things you said occur there's no offset. But it's a dynamic world and you got to manage the best you can with circumstances and that's what we do every day.","Joe O'Dea","Okay. I appreciate it. And then just on the cash side of things ending the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and trying to think about deployment options and just any context around how much cash you feel you need to have on the balance sheet for the credit rating and for other operational uses?","And whether you think about stepping above the typical payout range target or whether you think about other deployment options just given we continue to see the cash balance move higher and presumably it's set to go even higher next year.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, we think about all those things. But if you look at historically about our cash balance, if you go back 10 years, it's in the mid- to high teens as a percent of our total assets and that's where it sits currently. But it's an ongoing discussion and review with the board about payouts and buybacks et cetera and that will continue.","Joe O'Dea","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. I guess a new guy gets back in the pack here. I got to be honest - thank you very much. My questions have really been answered and David Raso I think asked a big question I had on mix so let me just dive a little deeper into it. I understand what you're saying about the residual value contracts in Europe. I was a little surprised that the impact was as big as it was. So if I look at your forecast fourth quarter 4% to 8% deliveries, I assume you're still getting 3% price and facing kind of 1% currency headwind.","Do these residual value guarantees is it more related to just traded a particular cohorts of trucks and with lower residuals during 3Q? Is it more that we're just trying to clear some inventory out of market?","When I think about revenues relative to deliveries because as David said that was kind of the part that surprised me was the difference here. Should I be thinking about kind of more 1:1 ratio as we head into 4Q or do these residual value deals continue to drag a little bit more heavily for the next quarter or two?","Ron Armstrong","I don't think we have the visibility to necessarily what the specifics of that but I think fourth quarter revenue I think thinking about it on a 1:1 basis is probably the way to think about it.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Fair enough. Well congratulations and thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi thanks. One more follow-up on the gross margin performance in 3Q, Ron you indicated 3% new truck price realization in the quarter but can you say if this more than offset higher average per truck material and labor cost? I know we typically have to wait for the 10-Q to get those specific numbers, but can you at least say whether the relationship was still positive in the third quarter?","Ron Armstrong","It was roughly offset. I mean when you see the 10-Q as we've drafted it now it looks like it's pretty much an offset for material and labor.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. Thanks. And then Ron just going back to the heavy-duty share gains in Europe due in part to the new product introductions, I believe you said that heavy duty orders were up 26% in the first half of the year. Are you able to say what DAF's order rate - order growth rate was in the third quarter?","Ron Armstrong","I don't have that detail handy here. But let's see if it's something we can grab. So if you compare the third quarter this year to the third quarter last year total European orders are at 4% for the quarter in Europe and 17% year-to-date.","Neil Frohnapple","Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is open.","Faheem Sabeiha","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you guys can provide a little more color around the Parts outlook for next year, just wondering how much of that growth is expected to come from freight activity versus higher engine sales and higher TRP part sales?","Ron Armstrong","I think it comes from a lot of different avenues. We continue to increase the level of EMX engines in the truck park on an ongoing basis. I think we're - since we started production I think we're at about 200000 and so with engine production next year that probably goes up another 15% or 20%. The engines are getting - the engines that we produced three or four, five, six, seven years ago are getting more into their maintenance period and so that's going to be a positive effect.","So I think engine parts has been and probably will continue to be the highest percentage growth driver for PACCAR Parts. But then you look at the increased level of TRP stores, the fleet services initiatives that our team is championing the e-commerce initiatives to really make it easier to interface with PACCAR Parts the team has done a great job and really superb performance this year.","Faheem Sabeiha","Sounds good. And then with regard to the gross margin outlook for next year, what does that assume as the parts margin are you guys expecting the parts margin to be relatively flat versus 2018? Or are you expecting continued growth there?","Ron Armstrong","No, I think that 27%, 27.5% range is probably a reasonable way to think about it.","Faheem Sabeiha","Okay. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Rob Salmon","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott.","Ron Armstrong","Hey, Rob.","Rob Salmon","Looking out to next year with regard to kind of the gross margins are you expecting any sort of drag in the first half associated with the hundreds of dollars of impact that you called out on the tariffs? Or should we be thinking about kind of price like this quarter offsetting any sort of that cost inflation?","Ron Armstrong","I think we should think about it better offsetting.","Rob Salmon","All right. That's helpful. And then, I think I had missed it if you can provide some color in terms of the used truck pricing trends that you guys are seeing from your models. I know you're continuing to generate a premium to the overall market, but can you give a sense of what you guys saw from that used price realization?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. I think if you compare the third quarter this year to a year ago, it's up about 10% overall. So it's been good. And we see that in the results in our Financial Services business in North America. In Europe, pricing is a little bit flat compared to where it was a year ago.","Rob Salmon","Got it. Helpful. Final one, in terms of the mix was the revenue per unit in U.S. and Canada how much was that down year-over-year? And I realized that the price realization is up 3%, but I'm assuming there's some mix within that segment as well. Am I thinking about that right for the third quarter?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. I don't think there's any dramatic puts and takes in terms of price per unit. I mean, it gets impacted a little bit by the mix of medium versus heavy-duty. But again, I don't think there's anything there that's different than what we would normally expect.","Rob Salmon","Okay. Really helpful, guys. Appreciate the time.","Ron Armstrong","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Yeah. Hi, guys. I just had a follow-up as soon as we just came back from IAA a couple of weeks ago whenever it was. One of the things that I find most interesting was walking IVECO's exhibit and all the signage they had around their booth for no diesel, no diesel, no diesel.","Can you just talk about your outlook longer-term for the growth of electric vehicles in Europe in particular just given the 2025 regulations that are going to come in place? And do you think that in Europe specifically the law would be the need for diesel also?","Ron Armstrong","I think in the economics of diesel just makes sense and they're going to continue to make sense for a long time. So it's going to be the dominant power source for long-haul trucking certainly. There's obviously going to be opportunities that will develop in urban areas that may bring about hybrids or electric vehicles and so we're prepared for those. You obviously saw at the IAA Show and drove our CF Electric.","We have a full suite of vehicles in terms of all-electric, heavy, light-duty, and we do that both in North America and Europe. So, we're well-prepared for the places where it makes sense. We think there will be local geographies more than they will generally widespread displacement of diesel for the foreseeable future.","Harrie Schippers","Yes. I think there's a growing sentiment that maybe the diesel with a zero emission hybrid capability may be the best economic solution for those inner-city applications where you need that zero emission requirement as opposed to a full electric option, which - it's just the batteries and the weight are still present and absent a break through that - to the economic case is a bit challenging.","Ron Armstrong","Yes. Maybe misinterpreted if that was the intent, but maybe it is more there approach to meeting these new non-diesel catchments as opposed to there won't be any diesel trucks left. So, I appreciate your color on that. That's helpful. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Sure. Yes, thank you.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ron Armstrong","We'd like to thank everyone for their participation and thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And if anyone has any objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported record quarterly net income of $447 million for the second quarter of 2015. Net income increased 40% compared to the results generated in the second quarter last year. PACCAR\u2019s second quarter sales and financial services revenues were $5.1 billion.","Gross margins for truck, parts and other operations were strong at 15.1%. The excellent margins coupled with the company\u2019s rigorous cost control generated 8.8% after tax return on revenues. I\u2019m very proud of our 24,500 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR delivered 41,600 trucks during the second quarter, an 8% increase versus the first quarter this year and slightly ahead of our expectations. The improvement reflects increased truck deliveries in North America and Europe due to economic growth and strong freight demand.","Looking ahead, we expect PACCAR\u2019s global truck deliveries in the third quarter to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter, reflecting the normal summer factory shutdown for DAF and Leyland. Third quarter gross margins for truck segment will be impacted by a higher percentage of deliveries to large fleets and the summer shutdown in Europe.","The European economic and truck market outlook continues to improve. GDP growth expectations for this year are 2.4% in the UK, which is PACCAR\u2019s strongest market in the region, with 1.5% GDP growth on the continent.","Freight transport activity on German highways is up 2.6% year-to-date through June compared to the same period last year and it\u2019s at the highest level since the German toll system was launched in 2007.","DAF heavy truck order intake for the second quarter was 60% higher than a year ago. We\u2019ve raised our forecast for Europe\u2019s greater than 16 ton market to a range of 240,000 to 260,000 units, reflecting the strength in orders and the improved economic outlook. DAF\u2019s heavy truck market share is 15% year-to-date.","The US economic picture remains positive with GDP forecast to grow 2.4% this year. The housing and automotive industries are bright spots in the economy and create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 11% this year to 1.1 million and the automotive industry is expected to deliver 16.9 million vehicles, near the record level of 17.3 million set in the year 2000.","US freight tonnage is at near record levels. We\u2019ve raised our US and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales estimate to a range of 270,000 to 290,000 units this year. The stronger market reflects expansion in industrial fleet capacity due to continued strong freight fundamentals.","Peterbilt and Kenworth\u2019s combined share of the US and Canadian market is 28% year-to-date. PACCAR\u2019s parts business generated record quarterly pre-tax profits of $146 million, a 15% increase compared to $127 million in the same quarter of last year. The strong results were driven by economic growth in the US and Europe and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR parts and our dealers.","PACCAR parts revenue was $777 million compared to $778 million achieved in the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translations, parts revenue would have been up 7% for the second quarter and first six months of this year.","PACCAR Financial Services\u2019 second quarter pre-tax income was $91 million compared to $92 million earned a year ago. Foreign currency translation reduced profit by $4 million for the quarter. The portfolio continues to grow and perform well.","PACCAR\u2019s strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest $5.9 billion in new products and facilities in the last 10 years. Our outstanding results this year reflect the quality of those investments.","Looking forward, PACCAR is well positioned for future growth, with further investments in geographic expansion, aftermarket parts and service capabilities and powertrain and truck technologies that increase fuel efficiency, safety and reliability.","This year, PACCAR\u2019s capital spending of $325 million to $375 million is targeted at enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency of our assembly and distribution facilities. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in the range of $225 million to $250 million.","PACCAR\u2019s technology leadership has been enhanced as Kenworth TruckTech+ and Peterbilt SmartLinq remote diagnostic systems are now in production on new Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 trucks specified with the PACCAR MX-13 engine. DAF plans to launch its connected truck technology in the fourth quarter of this year.","In addition, PACCAR parts has begun construction of a new 176,000 square foot distribution center in Renton, Washington. We expect this distribution center to open in mid-2016. DAF\u2019s cab factory in Westerlo, Belgium plans to begin construction of a new cab paint facility this year. This environmentally friendly paint facility will increase DAF\u2019s production capacity and utilize the latest robotic technology to improve operating efficiency.","PACCAR\u2019s Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.24 per share at its July meeting. The company has increased the regular quarterly dividend by more than 165% in the last six years.","PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry and providing excellent returns to its shareholders.","Thank you. And I\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","I guess I was interested in \u2013 you talked about the investments in powertrain capabilities going forward, can you just give us a little bit more detail on what specifically you\u2019re investing in?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s all about operating efficiency and being the leader in providing that to our customers to reduce their operating cost. So that\u2019s a continual stream of investment in research and development as well as capital to support those initiatives. We\u2019ve got greenhouse gas requirements coming into play in 2017 and additional requirements beyond that. And so we\u2019ll just continue to make those investments to support our customers.","Ann Duignan","And then on European outlook, can you talk about your revised outlook versus the very strong registrations we\u2019ve been seeing year to date particularly in June?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, our revised outlook reflects those, strength in those registrations as well as the strength of the DAF order intake. So we see that there could be some further upside potential as the year progresses. But as we see it now, we see it at that 10% improvement is certainly achievable and so there could be some upside.","Ann Duignan","And where specifically do you think the upside could come from? Is it Germany, UK or some of the weaker southern countries that are just coming from zero basically?","Ronald Armstrong","I think we\u2019ve seen general improvement across all the markets, some a little bit more than others, but general improvement across all.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","Ron, I\u2019m wondering if you could just bridge the margin performance for us in the quarter either year over year or sequentially at the gross margin line. Any specific or significant items that you highlight pricing versus cost, any other factors that you can just maybe help us understand pretty significant expansion on both year over year and sequentially?","Ronald Armstrong","As you know, we\u2019ve always maintained a healthy discipline of rigorous cost control and we continue to do that. So I think the operating leverage is the single biggest factor that we\u2019ve seen contribute to our margin performance over the last 12 months and quarter over quarter. So other positive things include some positive effects of materials and pricing, but those are muted compared to the operating leverage.","Jerry Revich","And then for the parts business, the 7% organic growth in the quarter, can you flush out for us whether Europe was above or below that? And any color that you can give us from a mix standpoint, I think this is the second or third quarter in a row in which parts mix was favorable to you folks, can you just talk about what\u2019s driving that?","Ronald Armstrong","The parts team has done a great job of continuing to build its programs and it\u2019s expanding its all mixed products capability for both trucks, trailers, buses, et cetera. And so we continue to see nice growth in that business. And we just really saw it spread pretty evenly across all of our geographies, both North America, Europe and around the world.","Jerry Revich","And lastly, in Europe, can you tell us what the book to bill was in the quarter or how much lead times lengthened as a result of the orders, just put the 60% order growth into context relative to production in the second quarter, if you don\u2019t mind?","Ronald Armstrong","Again, we don\u2019t think in those terms generally, but the backlog is very healthy and supports our expected plans to increase our build rate during the second half of this year.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Joe O\u2019Dea with Vertical Research.","Joe O\u2019Dea","The first question maybe more specifically on the margin in looking at the truck segment, because that seemed to be the strongest performer between truck and parts, and a very strong sequential incremental margin there. And so understandably some leverage benefit, but also I think you did talk a little bit about maybe some customer mix that was a benefit. Anything else in the quarter? And then how we should think about the back half of the year margin in the truck segment, whether 2Q is a good benchmark or some of the shifts that might happen to bring that down?","Ronald Armstrong","As I mentioned in my comments, we expect that the third quarter will be impacted by little heavier fleet mix in the third quarter as well is normal factory shutdown that we have in Europe. So some leverage effects related to that.","Joe O\u2019Dea","But other than that, nothing else specifically in the quarter to get 10.5% margin?","Ronald Armstrong","Nothing unusual in the second quarter and we don\u2019t have any expectations for any unusual items in the third quarter.","Joe O\u2019Dea","And then in North America, on sort of vocational demand, any sort of weakening that you\u2019ve seen in those markets related to oil and also just with respect to your backlog, did you see any higher activity in terms of cancellations in the quarter?","Ronald Armstrong","No. Cancellations have been at a very low rate and vocational trucks are very active, lots of reasonable growth in housing construction, commercial construction. So it\u2019s all been pretty steady.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan","Two questions. The first, can you just discuss where you\u2019re seeing some of the pricing dynamics both in North America and Europe?","Ronald Armstrong","I think pricing is reasonably consistent. We have great products, the Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF teams have pretty much have new product lines that are in the field over the last one to two years and those have been very well received. We continue to invest in fuel efficiency of our engines, the aerodynamics of our vehicles, and all those elements are very well received by our customers. Good value. So continue to achieve our premium pricing for our products. And the outlook is bright as we continue for the rest of this year and into next.","Patrick Nolan","Second question, very strong margin performance in the quarter, but some of your suppliers have actually said running at this pace of production for the industry inherently some inefficiencies that go along with that, do you see that? I mean, when you think about next year\u2019s volume outlook, even volumes off a little bit, the margin still go up in North America or is this kind of really good operating environment in your opinion?","Ronald Armstrong","I think it\u2019s a really good operating environment. I think we\u2019re in a good position right now and obviously our teams in our factories do a great job of managing to the conditions in the marketplace and we expect that that will continue as we move forward of course this year and next.","Robert Christensen","I would just add that the rate of increase in production over the last several quarters has been relatively modest and that has allowed the suppliers to lay in capacity and efficiency improvements in an orderly way and they are performing very well.","Patrick Nolan","Can I just sneak in one more, what percent of your Class 8 volume was the internal PACCAR engine?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s about 40%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","I\u2019m wondering about your visibility into 2016 at this point, how much of the 60% growth in orders in Europe would extend into 2016? And to what extent do you have North American orders for 2016 yet?","Ronald Armstrong","I\u2019d say most of the orders for DAF are 2015 build, some 2016 orders, but not a significant amount. And I would say that the build in North America, just a good, a few long term fleet orders that are in the backlog, but not a substantial percentage of 2016 expectations.","Steven Fisher","And would that be about typical with where you\u2019d expect to be for...","Ronald Armstrong","Yeah, right where we expect to be, a lot of discussions are going on right now with customers about their plans for 2016 and indications are that purchase expectations will be very similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in 2015.","Steven Fisher","And then very solid $600 million of free cash flow in the first half of the year. How do you see that shaping up in the second half? I mean, it looks like your CapEx is scheduled to pick up by maybe a couple of hundred million, but how about on the operating cash flow side?","Ronald Armstrong","I think the operating cash flow will be very consistent from what we\u2019ve seen in the first half. As you mentioned, the pace of investment in some of the capital projects will likely accelerate and we\u2019ll continue to invest in R&D.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase","So Ron, I guess my question is around the 3Q guidance that you gave. Can you give a little bit more on an order of magnitude, I know it\u2019s normal seasonality to see production dip down in the third quarter as well as gross margins, but can you characterize that at all versus what we saw in 2Q?","Ronald Armstrong","Yeah, I think as I mentioned, just the fact that we typically have a summer shutdown period in Europe and that\u2019s two full weeks and two partial weeks, which impacts the level of production. And so, that\u2019s just normal business.","From a margin perspective, as I mentioned, you do have some operating leverage effects of that and the mix of customers is a little bit more tilted towards the fleet side during the third quarter than what we saw in the second quarter.","Nicole DeBlase","And any change to the full year, I think you guys previously were saying about gross margins about in line with what you reported during 1Q, which would then embed like 100 bps of gross margin expansion?","Ronald Armstrong","I think given the performance in the second quarter, it\u2019d probably be up a bit from that.","Operator","The next question is from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Management.","Seth Weber","So going back to the customer mix, I mean, with the fleets, do you expect that to revert back in the fourth quarter to more or like what we saw in the second quarter? I\u2019m just trying to understand if this is a seasonal hiccup that you usually see or if there is something structurally that\u2019s changing here.","Ronald Armstrong","No, it\u2019s just normal month to month, quarter to quarter change in who we\u2019re building trucks for. Nothing more than that.","Seth Weber","So the order book reflects that it would shift back the other way?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s just pretty normal.","Seth Weber","If I could clarify something, there was the $4 million currency benefit that you talked to in the prepared remarks. Is that on the finco or was that total company contribution to profit?","Ronald Armstrong","That was on the financial services, it was a reduction of financial services profit for the second quarter versus the second quarter last year.","Seth Weber","And is there a number for how much currency affected the manufacturing business in the quarter for profitability?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. Let\u2019s get our hands on that. You\u2019re looking for the quarter?","Seth Weber","Right.","Ronald Armstrong","For the quarter, for the truck and other, it was $12 million of pretax profit negative impact. That was largely offset by a favorable cost on the engine content side from our engines fleet built in our Columbus, Mississippi. And on the parts side, it\u2019s about $12 million pretax profit impact.","Seth Weber","So in aggregate about $24 million total?","Ronald Armstrong","Yeah. And then the $4 million from financial services, so in aggregate about $28 million.","Seth Weber","And then if I could just sneak one last one, the SG&A continues to be lower than what we\u2019ve been expecting, is this a sustainable level do you feel like?","Ronald Armstrong","SG&A has also been benefiting from the impact of currency, a lot of our SG&A is outside the US and so we\u2019ve had some currency benefit. But the level that you\u2019re seeing is sustainable at these currency levels.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andy Casey","Could you help us a little bit more with the Q3 comment around production, are you basically expecting US, Canada build to be reasonably constant and then everywhere else basically to be down?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s all reasonably constant. I think we\u2019re talking about a 1% to 2% reduction in total truck production for the quarter. So it\u2019s going to be pretty comparable.","Andy Casey","And then the EBIT margin improvement in parts has been strong year over year for a couple quarters now. Are we beginning to see the improvement related to the increased proprietary engine content that you introduced a few years ago start to run through the parts line or is it just fundamentally the mix that you talked about?","Ronald Armstrong","I think there is definitely some benefit from higher increased engine parts sales. We\u2019re up about 90,000 MX engines in the field in North America and hundreds of thousands of engines in the field in Europe. And so that population continues to grow, so we see the benefit of that. And PACCAR parts has done a nice job of developing PACCAR brands and transitioning more and more of the parts sales to PACCAR branded components. So I think the execution by our parts team has been excellent.","Robert Christensen","I\u2019d add that there continues to be excellent leverage in the parts business from our distribution centers globally and we\u2019re benefitting from lower freight rates due to fuel prices.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker","Where are you tracking right now in North America and Europe in your truck plants for capacity utilization?","Ronald Armstrong","We have lots of capacity available in most of our factories to be able to produce trucks to meet customer demand. So it\u2019s not a concern for us.","David Leiker","And then there\u2019s a lot of discussion about where we are in the cycle and I\u2019d say we\u2019re in an elongated cycle here where economic growth continues to muddle along like we are and demand for trucks stays where it is. In that environment, what kind of ability do you think you have to push margins higher given a relatively constant level of high demand?","Ronald Armstrong","Operating leverage is a very positive thing and so to the extent that we can further take advantage of that, there\u2019s some upside. But if you took competitive market and we have great products to provide to our customers and we expect to get good value for what we\u2019re producing and we expect that to continue overtime. We continue to look for ways to make our plants continuously more efficient and achieve cost reductions to improve our results.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore.","David Raso","The stock is not really responding that much to a pretty strong print here so folks are obviously concerned about your ability to grow earnings next year. Can you help us understand a little bit then the moving parts of the incremental margins? Let\u2019s strip out currency, if somebody is looking at Europe next year, let\u2019s assume they think it\u2019s up, can you help us understand the incremental margin difference that we can expect to save and what you\u2019re seeing right now or just some framework of how to think about if you want to model Europe up, what kind of incrementals can you expect in that region to maybe offset some of the North American decrementals?","Ronald Armstrong","David, we obviously expect to the extent that we can increase production levels, there are some operating leverage benefits that go with that. And if you look at the performance overtime, incremental margins had been 20% plus or minus. And so that\u2019s probably more indicative of the longer term trend. And so to the extent that we can get additional volume, I would expect we\u2019d see that kind of performance going forward.","David Raso","But the question was splitting the geographies, because at least the base case is they\u2019re going opposite directions, right. So if North America is down 10% and Europe is up, you name the number, 15%, 20%, whatever it may be, people are trying to figure out of course North America is larger. But what kind of incremental margins could one expect from Europe given you\u2019re more vertically integrated there but obviously pricing is still a bit challenged there. So if you can help us at all differentiating between North America and Europe on incremental margins into next year.","Ronald Armstrong","I think the incremental\/decremental is very comparable across the geographies. So there\u2019s no significant difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","First thing, I was just wondering could you just walk through deliveries by region?","Ronald Armstrong","Sure. We actually added a table in our press release at the very end of the schedules.","Ted Grace","I apologize. I missed that.","Ronald Armstrong","That\u2019s okay.","Ted Grace","Second thing I was hoping you might be able to walk through is just in terms of the situation in Europe with the EC, I know you provided an update in the press release saying that you\u2019re unable to give an estimate for the impact. And I was just wondering if you could remind us why you can\u2019t quantify that? I recognize that there can be different reporting requirements for US versus European companies, but just as a reminder, can you give us the reason why we can\u2019t walk through a quantitative framework? And then related basis, would it be fair to assume we could look at the European competitors at least as a framework to think about PACCAR\u2019s exposure?","Ronald Armstrong","I can\u2019t comment on what the competitors have done. Our press release has an update, not any significant developments during the quarter. So that\u2019s about all I can say about that.","Ted Grace","And then the last thing if I could just ask, I know you said there were a lot of great things going in the business, I think the numbers speak for themselves, but can you talk about where your biggest concerns are, what\u2019s keeping you up at night, anything that\u2019s on the horizon that you\u2019re very mindful of that you would point to?","Ronald Armstrong","We have a great team that delivers great results as evidenced by the press release. And so I sleep pretty well most nights, I got to tell you. There\u2019s always challenges, always opportunities and so we look forward to seizing those and taking advantage of those as we move forward. So that\u2019ll always continue to be our approach.","Operator","The next question is from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.","Ross Gilardi","I wanted to understand on the deliveries versus the geographic revenue breakdown, so you had an 8% decline in European sales on a 25% increase in deliveries. I understand what\u2019s happened with the euro\/dollar, but even if you factor that in, it seems like there\u2019s a big gap and I\u2019m wondering if you can help bridge that, is that pricing or something with the mix or any help there?","Ronald Armstrong","So the effects of the euro on revenue for the quarter was about $250 million. So you add that back to the equation and part of it is a little bit larger mix of the light duty trucks, the model LF compared to the CF, XF mix during the first half of last year.","Ross Gilardi","Anything in particular driving that?","Ronald Armstrong","No, just customer demand, all the trucks are great and the LF is particularly popular in the UK and very well received by customers and that market has grown little faster than the rest of Europe, reflecting their economic growth. And so we\u2019re seeing some benefits from that phenomenon.","Ross Gilardi","And then back on the parts margin, so you\u2019ve had two consecutive quarters of 18% to 19%, should we look at this as the newer and higher baseline going forward? And is there any reason why that number actually can\u2019t go up if you continue to post 6% to 8% organic growth in the parts business over the next several years like you have in the past?","Ronald Armstrong","I think as Bob said, we\u2019ve gotten the benefits of operating leverage and that should continue. Obviously, freight rates are dependent lot on diesel prices. And so that will go up or down as diesel prices move. But again, our team has done a good job of transitioning to PACCAR branded components and with our newest designs, we have a higher element of proprietary content. So I think we\u2019re in good shape and positioned well and shouldn\u2019t see significant movements from where we\u2019re at currently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter.","Mike Shlisky","Wanted to ask you guys about Brazil, it wasn\u2019t really mentioned in the press release or in any of your comments. I know it\u2019s been a really rough market this year, wondering if you can give us your thoughts as to how that\u2019s going and whether the DAF volumes there are ramping in line with your expectations.","Ronald Armstrong","So we continue to be a pretty small player in that market. Our team is doing great. The factory is running very well. The quality of the product is excellent and very well received by the customers. Our dealers continue to invest in their facilities to fully represent the DAF brand in the market. The market this year will be down substantially, probably in the 45,000 to 55,000 truck range, South America total probably 70,000 to 80,000 trucks for the year. But we have a great team and a great long term perspective on building our business. And it will be a bigger and bigger contributor to PACCAR\u2019s results overtime.","Mike Shlisky","My other question is about the new parts DC that\u2019s opening in 2016 in Washington. Is there any chance for any kind of a gross margin impact while there\u2019s some kind of a transition or in the opening process there at some point during 2016?","Ronald Armstrong","No, we opened and expand distribution centers on an ongoing basis and it\u2019s just part of continuing to support that growing parts business and our dealers\u2019 needs to have same day delivery to meet their needs. So there won\u2019t be any margin impact as a result of that transition.","Operator","The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Just one quick question, the 40% you\u2019re doing with your own engines in the US, what\u2019s the \u2013 any update on the near and long-term target there?","Ronald Armstrong","I think we\u2019ll continue to see that grow, more and more customers a lot of times they\u2019ll start with some level if they\u2019re a larger fleet and as they get experience, most will often increase their percentage penetration in our fleet with the MX engine. So we expect that to continue to grow 50%, 60% overtime. The engine has the capability to meet about 80% of our customers\u2019 needs. So we\u2019re very excited about the potential for that as we progress over the next three to five years.","Robert Christensen","Today, in the North American market, we offer the PACCAR MX 13, beginning next year we\u2019ll also be offering the PACCAR MX 11 engine which was introduced in Europe a couple of years ago with a great success. So we\u2019ll be enhancing the North American engine lineup.","Scott Group","And is 50% to 60% you think that\u2019s a realistic target for next year?","Ronald Armstrong","I think overtime.","Scott Group","How about on the medium duty side?","Ronald Armstrong","We install PACCAR engines, branded engines purchased from Cummins for our medium duty product.","Scott Group","I guess the question was, do you think about doing \u2013 expanding into the medium duty on the engine side here in North America?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s always a possibility, but nothing on the short term horizon for us in that area.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","I just wanted to follow up on the outlook for the MX platform, the 13 specifically. Have you entered into conversations with other OEMs unnamed who might be interested in buying that engine from you over time? Is there an opportunity that you could sell that to competitors?","Ronald Armstrong","Typically it hasn\u2019t been our approach. We have a great engine to support our product and we got the capacity to support future growth, but selling to other OEMs is not an avenue that we thought about pursuing.","Ted Grace","Could it be conceivable if it \u2013 obviously get you volume and not just pull through but obviously profit margin with that?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s possible, but really not part of our thought process at this time.","Robert Christensen","We do sell a handful of engines to bus, luxury bus and coach manufacturers, but it\u2019s really not significant in terms of overall production mix.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ronald Armstrong","I would like to thank everyone for their excellent questions and thank you operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR\u2019s earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings PACCAR's' Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller. As with prior conference calls we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode.","Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.","I would now like to introduce Preston Feight.","Preston Feight","Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on PACCAR's excellent second quarter results and business highlights. First and foremost, I am very proud of our exceptional employees. We're passionate about providing our customers, the highest quality, highest performing trucks and services in the world.","I also want to thank those analysts who participated in our investor conference in New York in May. The PACCAR team appreciated the opportunity to provide an update on our business.","PACCAR achieved record quarterly sales and financial services revenues of $6.6 billion and excellent net income of $620 million resulting in a 9.3% after tax return on revenues.","PACCAR Parts generated record revenues of over $1 billion and record pretax profits of $211 million. Parts revenues increased 6% and profits grew 8% compared to the second quarter of last year.","PACCAR achieved robust Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.8%, driven by record truck deliveries, aftermarket parts demand and strong operational performance. PACCAR delivered a record 52,300 trucks during the second quarter, 13% higher than the second quarter of last year. This reflects increased build in North America, partially offset by lower build in Europe.","The US and Canadian Class 8 industry backlog remains high. Kenworth and Peterbilt\u2019s 2019 production schedules are substantially full with customers ordering trucks for delivery in the first half of next year.","In Europe, DAF has achieved an excellent year-to-date market share of 16.7% and the DAF XF was honored as the fleet truck of the year in the UK. PACCAR continues to provide excellent annual operating margins resulting in strong operating cash flow for distribution to shareholders and for reinvestment in future growth.","PACCAR declared second quarter dividends of $0.32 per share and first half dividends of $0.64 per share. First half dividends were 21% higher than dividends declared in the same period last year. The company has delivered annual dividends in the range of 45% to 55% of net income for many years and has paid a dividend every year since 1941.","PACCAR has increased its quarterly dividend an average of 11% per year during the last 20 years. We repurchased 345,000 shares of stock during the second quarter with a $484 million remaining in the current Board of Directors authorization.","PACCAR is investing in future growth with capital expenditures of $675 million to $725 million and R&D expenses of $320 million to $340 million this year. These investments will fund enhanced aerodynamic truck models, integrated powertrains, zero emissions electric and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity.","We are also enhancing our manufacturing and distribution facilities. At the Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio truck factory we added a new robotic cab build cell and are constructing a new state-of-the-art paint facility, which will lower operating costs, enhance quality and increase capacity.","To meet increased customer demand for the popular PACCAR MX engine, we\u2019re adding machining and assembly equipment in the Columbus, Mississippi engine plant.","We recently opened two global software R&D centers, one in Kirkland, Washington and one in the Eindhoven, in The Netherlands. These centers will accelerate the development of embedded vehicle software and PACCAR connected vehicle solutions for our customers.","In the third quarter, truck delivery will be higher in North America due to higher build rates and lower in Europe, reflecting the normal three week summer shutdown. Global deliveries will be 5% to 7% higher than the third quarter of last year.","We forecast third quarter gross margins for Truck, Parts and Other to remain strong and be in a range of 14.5% to 15%. 2019 will be another outstanding year for the company.","Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on truck markets, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services.","Harrie Schippers","Thanks, Preston. US economy is in good shape, helped by a strong job markets, growing wages and increased business investment. Freight tonnage has grown a healthy 4.4% year-to-date. We\u2019ve raised our estimate of US and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales to a range of 300,000 to 320,000 vehicles this year. We\u2019re in a period of robust customer demand, demonstrated by the historically high backlog, truck production levels and retail sales.","The US and Canada Class 8 backlog was 188,000 trucks at the end of June. Kenworth and Peterbilt\u2019s backlog represented 36% of the industry. We are raising our European above 16 tonne market projection to a range of 300,000 to 320,000 vehicles this year. The European economies are growing at a lower rate than last year.","PACCAR delivered record first half net income of $1.25 billion. PACCAR Parts achieved record first half revenues of $2.30 billion [ph] and record pre-tax profits of $418 million. PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market shares over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. This large and growing Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF truck part has driven 8% annual PACCAR Parts revenue growth over the last 15 years.","This generates consistent higher margin profitability in all phases of the business cycle. We continue to invest in the parts business with new parts distribution centers under construction in Las Vegas, Nevada and Ponta Grossa, Brazil. We expect parts sales to grow 5% to 7% for the full year 2019.","PACCAR Financial Services earned second quarter pretax income of $18 million, 11% higher than the second quarter last year. The PACCAR Financial portfolio performed well. This year, PACCAR Financial will open used truck centers in Prague, Czech Republic and Denton, Texas to support solid customer demand for DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks.","One of PACCAR's greatest assets does not appear on the balance sheet. I am referring to the independent financially strong Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers, who operate more than 2200 sales, service and TRP store locations worldwide.","Our dealers reflect the industry leading quality and premium truck brand image of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks. We\u2019re proud of our global dealer network. They are the best in the industry.","Thank you. We would be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Stephen Volkmann","Harrie, I wonder if I could get you to make a few more comments about some of your kind of end market visibility. And what I'm thinking about is obviously, you said you're sort of taking orders for the first half of 2020, but of course the overall order rate has come down quite a bit.","And I'm curious just kind of what you're hearing from customers in seeing in your order trends relative to demand in 2020? Do you think things tick up again as we get into the fall selling season? Or are you hearing kind of caution because freight rates have come down. Just kind of some thoughts about the quality of the 2020 order?","Harrie Schippers","So if you look at the backlog for North America today, we\u2019re in really good shape. And like Preston said, we\u2019re increasing build rates in North America. Europe, the backlog is very normal and our production levels are in line with the orders and the backlog in the market as we see it today.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. So do you have any kind of preliminary thoughts about what 2020 might look like? Obviously, the market is sort of primed for a big decline?","Harrie Schippers","We typically comment on 2020 once we get closer to it, so that's probably something for the next call.","Stephen Volkmann","All right. I figure it might be worth a try. Can I sneak one more in on just kind of what you\u2019re seeing relative to pricing in the new truck environment?","Harrie Schippers","Yes. As we look at the pricing realization in trucks, in the second quarter we saw I'm going to say a couple of percent, price realization largely offset by costs. And so that's kind of in balance with each other.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Andrew Casey","Thanks a lot. Good morning as well.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Andrew Casey","I have a question on the shipments. It went up about 1.5% in Q2 from Q1. It's a little different than the outlook on the short term that you gave last quarter of 2% to 4%. Was the entire difference between actual and predicted driven by Europe?","And if so, I guess, to piggyback on Steve\u2019s question, can you describe what your European order intake maybe was compared to last year? And then, also, some color around the overall market development.","Preston Feight","Yes. So, just look at the - start at the highest level, although, we did see growth in North America this year and that was, as we've said, offset a little bit by what we experienced in Europe. We have really good balance here, right now, between our order intake and our build rates. So we've got that set up really well. And in fact, if you look at the first half market share results, we had 16.7%, which is above last year's record 16.6%. So that's set up very nicely for us right now. And we kind of see that order intake, as I said, matching into what we are doing with build right now.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you. And then on the \u2013 just specifically looking at the truck segment margin and it pretty much seemed to be in line with what you were looking for. But flattish, up maybe 10 basis points year-over-year and then down from Q1, despite higher revenue in both cases.","Can you elaborate now that the quarter is done in terms of what some of the headwinds might have been that limited the segment\u2019s ability to realize, maybe, some the better margin leverage on that revenue growth?","Preston Feight","Sure. I think if you look at \u2013 if you start with \u2013 it was 14.8% in the overall gross margin, it feels very strong. So when we look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, truck has been able to hold onto that. I think, the reason it doesn't see significant movement up is because it's already operating at a very high level. So we\u2019re at a very efficient point in the gross margins.","And then, I think if you just talked about it a little bit from a sequential standpoint, only difference between Q1 and Q2 has to do with really the customer mix that's happened between quarter one and quarter two.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","Hey, guys. How\u2019s it going?","Preston Feight","Really good. How's it going for you?","Joel Tiss","All right. I wondered, just to try to be Steve for a second here. Can you talk about second half production instead of just third quarter? And the production schedules and just sort of give us a little bit of an idea, so maybe we can have a small window into the fourth quarter.","Preston Feight","Well, we \u2013 if I try to talk about it in terms of second half, we have, again, North America going up in the second half. And then, Europe, we think is stable where we got it right now. So we feel like those are balanced for what we would expect to see through the second half.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And then beyond the customer mix, it sounded like in North America, but maybe I am reading too much into that. Is there any negative margin? The incremental margins at 10%, you\u2019ve been kind of running 12% or 13%, is there any \u2013 because Latin America was so strong, is that a factor in there or not at all?","Preston Feight","Latin America is a small percentage of the business still, so it really didn't have that much weeding factor to us. I mean, there is a little bit of benefit to it, but there's not a lot.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And then just last, the receivable\u2019s up 30%. Is there any color you can add to that? Why is that so high?","Preston Feight","Increasing in the build rates has been the primary driver of that.","Joel Tiss","Okay. So it just seems like it's up a lot more than builds. Okay. Thank you very much.","Preston Feight","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes, hi. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone.","Preston Feight","Good morning and good afternoon.","Jerry Revich","I am wondering if you could expand on your comments on the European production adjustment that you took in the quarter that could match income in order rates. When was that production adjustment take place? And as we think about the third quarter, normal seasonality would have production down 5% to 10% sequentially for you in Europe.","So are we on at the right production point entering the third quarter where we should see that normal seasonality? Or is production coming down sequentially more than that normal 5% to 10% rate?","Preston Feight","So the adjustments we made were just in the second quarter and again they happened throughout the second quarter and they still delivered this excellent market share that we saw.","From the third quarter looking forward, we do have a normal summer shutdown, which is a three week summer shutdown, so there is an overall effect on the market. But from a daily build rate standpoint we\u2019re in a good position.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And in North America, we obviously know that you folks are build-to-order and when market are in flex, we typically see production adjustments from you folks first, so when you folks are raising build rates sequentially 3Q versus 2Q, does that imply that you\u2019ve had a full backlog scrub and you\u2019re comfortable with the level of dealer inventories?","Can you just confirm that point and that expected deliveries for 3Q have firm customer specifications through them as opposed to what are some typical dealer specs?","Preston Feight","I think you did a really nice job of it. I think we actually do, do backlogs to make sure we have clean orders in there and we do build-to-order. And as we look through that and we see that there is still very strong order backlog. And Harrie said that 36% of the backlog for the industry is ours.","And so we want to make sure that we get the trucks to the customers. They need the trucks to run the businesses. And so we\u2019re in a manner of building as quickly as we can for them.","Jerry Revich","And in terms of the level of dealer inventories, can you just calibrate outside of the industry statistics that we have. You mentioned a backlog were 36% of backlog what about out of inventories?","Preston Feight","So if you think of the inventory numbers for the industry they're at 2.8 months and for PACCAR in North America it's 2.3. So we have our inventory in a very good position with our dealers.","Jerry Revich","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Ann Duignan","Hi, everybody. I'd like to circle back to Europe, I mean registrations year-to-date are up closer to 10% and your deliveries are basically flat, maybe up slightly year-to-date. Can you talk about the discrepancy, have we seen a pull forward of registrations ahead of the mid-year tachograph requirement? Or is there anything unusual going on in the marketplace versus how you are choosing to deliver?","Preston Feight","I think you actually nailed it Ann. I think that remote tachograph is probably the biggest impact on what's put forward the orders in front of June 15th. And so that's what we saw. And we still expect the market in the 300,000 to 320,000 truck range. And we should be able to have really excellent market share and with our build rates from the first half and second half for that.","Ann Duignan","And just as a follow-up to that again on Europe, given the announcement today and the new leadership in the UK, does that raise or reaccelerate the concerns on Brexit and the impact that that could have on freight and just the whole industry as we get closer to the end of the year? What are you hearing over there in terms of now it sounds like it's a little bit more definitive?","Preston Feight","Yes. So one of the nice things for us is we are the market leader in the UK. We have a great job all around Europe and our share is up in Europe and up in the UK also specifically. So as we look at what might happen with Brexit, we have a great advantage in that we do manufacture all our truck models for the UK, in the U.K.","So I don't know what the outcomes will be, but PACCAR is really well positioned with our manufacturing based in Europe to take advantage of it either way it goes.","Ann Duignan","I meant more broadly what impact it might have on just freight and the whole European economy, any comments on that?","Preston Feight","Yes, I don't think we know that answer any better than anybody else. I would say that we've been pleasantly surprised with how the UK has performed in the first half of the year. There have been strong customer demand in the first half and that's been great.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in line. I appreciate it.","Preston Feight","Thanks, Ann.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open.","David Leiker","Good morning, everyone.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","David Leiker","I wanted to talk about this kind of triangle effect between orders, backlog, inventory if you can throw counsels in there. Now what we\u2019re going through here in North America is while the order rates have fallen, the backlogs have remained elevated.","And I'm not sure we\u2019ve ever gotten through a period of falling orders where backlogs remained elevated. I am wondering if that may change a little bit of the economics, the earnings you might see as these lower order rates flow through the numbers?","Preston Feight","I think one thing you just need to keep in mind is the bigger picture what happened last year with 458,000 industry orders last year. So that\u2019s a big number and it takes a while for that to normalize through things.","But it's not going to have an effect on our financial performance. We've got great financial performance and our dealers are doing really well and our customers love the trucks. And so, those things continue to work well and the results will be solid.","David Leiker","Great. And just I'm going to take on Europe also. Any particular markets or areas over there that you feel more worried than others? I mean, a lot of those - a lot of your customers from those markets are exporting out of Europe and to other parts of the world as well?","Preston Feight","I think that Europe has done really well this year for us. I mean, obviously, we have the market range of 300,000 to 320,000 trucks and us gaining share. So this would be the fourth year in a row about 300,000, if it stays like this and that's a fantastic market size.","And the DAF team, all the employees, the teams, the dealers are doing a great job of growing the business. I think, the customers love the trucks and the fuel economy is outstanding. It's working really well.","David Leiker","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good afternoon and good morning.","Preston Feight","Good afternoon and good morning.","Steven Fisher","How do the orders that you guys have taken for 2020 compare to the level of what you typically take in at this time of the year for the following year? I assume it's got to be much higher. And if that's so, I guess why are - I guess going back to Steve Volkmann's question, why are customers rushing to place orders if freight fundamentals are softening?","Preston Feight","Well, I would say it this way. As I'd say, we probably just get to the first part of your question, we do see order intake for 2020 higher than we typically see it. That\u2019s in large part because in a different market, you might see that there's a lot more activities surrounded about filling 3Q and 4Q of the current year you\u2019re in. But since that's substantially full, there is interest in 2020. And so that's kind of just I think where people\u2019s energies go to.","Steven Fisher","But with freight fundamentals softening, why wouldn't they just waited out a little bit to see how the rest of the year is going to go?","Preston Feight","I think some people do, but freight fundamentals are really mixed, right? We have a great economy in North America. GDP growth is occurring, I think through May ATA truck tonnage was up 4.4%. So there's not like things are going badly. And we spend a lot of time as a team with our employees and our dealers talking to customers.","Customers are doing a good job. You see the truck companies\u2019 earnings reports and they are coming out really strong in a lot of cases. So, there\u2019s lot of reason for optimism too.","Steven Fisher","Got it. And then you said that the costs offset price in the quarter. It sounded like price you said it was a couple of percent which may be down 1% or so from the first quarter. I would have expected cost to be coming down. So I guess why was the pricing growth moderating? And should we be expecting that costs are actually coming down going forward here?","Preston Feight","Harrie, you want offer your color?","Harrie Schippers","It's like Preston just said, it's mostly customer mix that pricing was aligned with the cost increases more or less.","Steven Fisher","And what was that customer mix difference between Q2 and Q1?","Preston Feight","So, the customer difference is in the first quarter a lot of dealers lot of stock trucks on their lots and those are small quantity buys and then we get into a more distributed look at customer mix in the second quarter. So, there\u2019s still the stock orders, but then there's just the low to large-sized customer orders come in.","Steven Fisher","Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Seth Weber","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to go back. I think your guidance for the parts revenue growth for this year you moderated the top end, I think you're now saying 5% to 7%, it was previously 5% to 8%. Is there anything you can call out there that is causing the sort of moderation? Thanks.","Preston Feight","Yes. Sure, the parts business is really doing fantastic. It continues to perform at a high level. Take the opportunity to say as we look at where investments are going in that business and new distribution centers in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, and Las Vegas and the way the team is moving through their initiatives with things like e-commerce and TRP growth is really fantastic. The only reason for any adjustment is really a currency effect that we pushed into the 5% to 7%.","Harrie Schippers","It's the revenues in Europe in euros that translate into a fewer dollars when we do the translation.","Seth Weber","That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. The FinCo margin actually came down sequentially. Is there anything that you'd call out there? And is that sort of the run rate we should think of going forward? Thank you. ","Preston Feight","I don't think so. I don't think it's - when we look at the new business generation, it's actually up quarter-over-quarter. So it's more about portfolio that you're talking about. But the team is doing really good. If you look at the earnings per quarter, it went up to $80 million and to the $164 million in the first half and it's just doing fantastic.","Harrie Schippers","Yes.","Seth Weber","Okay. Thank you very guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Yes. Thanks, guys. I was just wondering what are you seeing in the Mexican truck market and what would you do if some of the trade tensions that started to rematerialize a couple of months ago came back?","And do you think your overall footprint in North America given your relative lack of exposure to Mexican production is behind any of the order share strength you\u2019ve seen? In other words are customers perhaps ordering more from PACCAR just because there's greater surety of supply, given some of your competitors being relatively more exposed to Mexican production?","Preston Feight","I think the team in Mexico has just done a really good job down there. We have great trucks. Obviously, the newest trucks we've introduced, the latest generation are fantastic were well received by the customers.","And so, their share was exceptionally good. And if you look at the recent emissions changes happened in the middle of the year. So there is a strong buy ahead of that. But even since then, order intake has been positive and doing quite well. I don't think it's really affected by where people think we're going to build the trucks. And we, obviously, can build trucks in Mexico for Mexico. We can make our domestic U.S. and Canadian production in local markets.","So I think we just have a great manufacturing footprint that works well and I don't think there is anything about trade tensions affecting that, I think, it's more about great trucks and people.","Harrie Schippers","I guess, that's the point. Most of what you produce in Mexico is for the Mexican market, correct? And if you did see tariffs all of a sudden, actually come back and put into place, do you feel like you have sufficient capacity in the US market to just relocate some of that production in a very short-term basis?","Preston Feight","Yes. We do have that capability.","Ross Gilardi","Okay. And then, I think, you made a comment about adding engine capacity in Mississippi, if I heard it right. And I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. Are you seeing share shift more towards the MX engine with the trucks that you're selling?","Preston Feight","The MX engine, MX-11 and 13 engines are doing really well. They are providing, I think, just outstanding fuel economy in the market space. People had time to get used to them obviously now. And we\u2019re seeing strong demand from our customers for those engines, for their lightweight and high performance.","So we've increased our capacity in Columbus and just recently finished that capacity increase at the end of the second quarter and going to be able to build some more engines for our customers in the second half.","Ross Gilardi","Can you say it roughly how much you've increased capacity in Columbus?","Preston Feight","It\u2019s been meaningful, but it's 10% to 20% kind of numbers.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And just lastly on Brazil, maybe you could comment there. I mean, you've had obviously pretty explosive growth over the last couple of years. Remind us where you are on markets share?","And I think from the beginning, the target was to get to 10% in 5 to 6 years. As you continue to get closer to that number, do you start to grow more in line with the Brazilian market in the next couple of years?","Preston Feight","Well, the trucks, the DAF trucks in Brazil are working very, very well for our customers. I was down there just a couple of months ago and the dealers and customers are really excited with the performance they get, reliability, durability and fuel economy that they're providing in Brazil. So that's enabling our continued growth. From a year-over-year standpoint, market share is up just a bit and it will continue to grow, continue to make investments in Brazil.","Parts business is doing really well down there. In the middle of building a new distribution center in Ponta Grossa, 160,000 square-foot distribution center in Ponta Grossa, which will support the business growth. And the market overall is improving in Brazil.","So really feeling good about the efforts our team has made down there. The results they're bringing, the success with the dealers now and just how the business is going to continue forward.","Ross Gilardi","Thank you.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Jamie Cook","Hello. I guess, just a question, specifically, what is your visibility in 2020 this quarter, relative to last quarter? I am just trying to understand if it's increased to what degree? And then my second quarter - second question is, assuming industry forecasts are correct next year, I'm just - if you can walk us through over there, is there anything we should consider with regards to decrementals relative to previous cycles in the sense that one I would assume the parts business, obviously, helps your margins, you have the content on the MX engine at the same time one could argue you are more vertically integrated and R&D costs should be structurally higher.","So if there's anything you could help us out with? And then one is the \u2013 are the shift decrementals be meaningfully different in Europe versus the U.S? Thanks.","Preston Feight","Sure. There is a lot of questions in there, I'm not sure I can get it right for you. From a 2020 order intake, I think that we\u2019re seeing as I said earlier, the higher percentage than we do typically. We have great visibility that means, comparatively to normal [Technical Difficulty] but it feels positive compared to previous years.","From effective what 2020 overall market is going to be, I think as Harrie said, and we all say is it\u2019s a little bit early we're talking about what the full market size is going to be in 2020. And from an effect on decremental margin or margins or incremental margins, they may end up being, I'd say, that we see that we keep our operating costs really low, and I think that means those relatively minor shifts in the decremental or incremental margins and continue to provide good value to our \u2013 to the margin the overall margin stateside.","Jamie Cook","Okay. But no meaningful difference relative to previous downturns? I mean, is there any structural reason why decrementals would be better? Or just, I mean, if you're right on the top line in incrementals that's a different question, but are decrementals should\u2026","Preston Feight","No. I don't think so.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi. Thanks. Thanks for the question. Just going back to Andy's question on your production this quarter. I think you had originally forecasted that all the increase would be from North America and kind of it looks like it was pretty evenly split between North America and other.","So why is your North America production in line with your expectations? I know we discussed your kind of at once, but just wanted to confirm that.","Preston Feight","Yes. Our North American production was in line with expectation. I think the only place where there was any slight change was in Europe where we just made sure we got our build rates adjusted to the market. So that's the overall effect.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Got you. And then just on the CapEx waves [ph], just want to make sure, is this similar to last quarter where it's a lot of projects getting done faster or moving more quickly than expected? Or are there any new projects that we should be thinking about?","Preston Feight","Sure. It's really fun, I mean, we're making these great investments in the future for the company, and so that's why you're seeing the CapEx changes. But we have just some fantastic opportunities that are really in terms of our capacity and quality in our factories, our distribution centers for parts and used trucks.","And then maybe most importantly for the long-term benefit is the investments in new products that we are creating. And so there is a lot of programs going on and they're successfully moving along. And we think it's really building a bright future for us.","Courtney Yakavonis","Okay. Got you. And then just finally in South America I think you slightly reduced your industry guidance there. I just wanted to confirm that and maybe how it compares. I think last quarter you had guided to Brazil up 55,000 to 75,000, just wanted to understand the dynamics at play there?","Harrie Schippers","I don't think the guidance for Brazil is the same as what we did last time. I think for total South America, the range might have dropped 5,000. So from a \u2013 I think we\u2019re now\u2026","Preston Feight","100 to 110 for South America in total.","Harrie Schippers","Yes, but it's outside Brazil.","Preston Feight","Brazil is still guiding at 70,000 as a midpoint, 65,000 to 75,000, South America 100,000 to 110,000.","Courtney Yakavonis","Perfect, great. Thank you.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you, very much. Good morning, everyone.","Preston Feight","Hey, good morning.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point. Just a couple of nits. You mentioned that you are seeing orders for 2020 at this point, yet we do know there are some aspects of the trucking markets seeing pain particularly on the pricing side to your point not so much the volumes. Have you seen any change on the specs that customers are asking for 2020 versus 2019?","Preston Feight","No. It's a nice question. I think really the customers are always looking for the most fuel efficient, lowest operating costs trucks that they can find. And that\u2019s the beauty of being PACCAR as we provide that to our customers. We have this passionate team of people who do a great job of making sure the trucks we develop and sell are really at the best and most efficient vehicles for our customers.","And so, I think that's what they're always looking at. We're always going to the customers about to make sure the specs stay and lined up that way, but there hasn't been any fundamental shift.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. And then just one last nit. I noticed that tax rate was up a little bit sequentially from the first quarter. That could be just randomness, but I am wondering, might that have to do with maybe more profitability being driven out of North America? What should I be thinking in terms of tax rate for the full year?","Preston Feight","Yes. I think you hit it on the head there. It's an income mix of North America tax rates. So, including states, a little bit higher than Europe, and so that affected in the quarter.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. All right. That\u2019s all I have. All the questions have been asked already. Congratulations and thank you.","Preston Feight","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Joe O'Dea","Hi. With the North America build rate going up in 3Q, I think historically it's not uncommon to then see it come down in 4Q, but that's usually with Europe going up. And so I'm just curious with some of what's going on in Europe right now? Should we expect that you got your current plans at this point that that increase in the build rate in North America for 3Q is something that you would maintain in 4Q?","Preston Feight","Yes. We have a strong backlog as we said. It's substantially full for the second half and so we don't see any reason not to think the build rates stays roughly where it is for the fourth quarter in the US and Canada.","Harrie Schippers","But you're right that the fourth quarter in US and Canada will have more holidays than the third quarter and Europe is just the opposite, so daily build rates doesn't change overall.","Joe O'Dea","Yes. Just a question on the daily build rates, so yes. And then, your comments around months of inventory, industry at 2.8, you're at 2.3. I think historically, the industry average is in the low two. So I'm just curious historically, where you average as we think about sort of through cycle targets?","Preston Feight","This is within our normal band and it is kind's of a healthy space to be.","Joe O'Dea","Perfect. And then just one of the 2020 orders you're taking, how is that pricing compared to 2019?","Preston Feight","It just depends on the customer, but the pricing is fairly consistent right now. ","Joe O'Dea","Got it. Thanks very much.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi, good morning. Is inventory at your used truck centers starting to rise at all? And any thoughts on the used trucks market in North America and Europe both from a demand and pricing standpoint?","Preston Feight","Yes. I think if you look at the used trucks maybe the pricing has moderated a bit from where it was in Q1, but one of the nice things about being part of PACCAR is our trucks have commanded 10% to 15% premium in the market. And as we've watched our market share grow over the past several years we've invested in creating a great used truck capability, selling capability.","So that's why we got this new facility, used truck facility we're building a Denton, Texas. A few years ago we did one in Los Angeles. In Europe we're creating one in Prague, in the Czech Republic as well. And then adding on capacity, we have a fantastic dealer network that does a good job of managing used trucks and distributing used trucks to customers. So between our premium position and our capability we feel like we\u2019re in a good space. ","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. And as a follow-up to that if used truck prices were continue to moderate, what's the time lag as far as when that starts impacting the FinCo profitability? I think it usually runs through that interest and other lines? Is there a couple of quarter's lag or any thoughts there? ","Preston Feight","Yes. I don't think we kind of calibrated into which quarter it would have an impact on and obviously it would depend on the matter of fact and depends a lot on the percent of retail versus wholesale. And our team that's a really good job of selling a lot of used trucks in the retail position. So there is too many mix effect in there that really characterize it. ","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. And then just one final one on the medium duty market here in North America, any notable changes to the outlook? What you're seeing from customer\u2019s market share et cetera? Thank you.","Preston Feight","Yes, sure. Thanks for the questions. The market size seems consistent to what we said previously and 100,000 units plus or minus and then the business is doing really well. I think that our trucks are performing well in the space and our market share will be roughly in the same range.","Neil Frohnapple","Great. Thanks so much.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Melius. Your line is now open.","Robert Wertheimer","Thank you and good morning everybody.","Preston Feight","Good morning.","Robert Wertheimer","My question is pretty simple. I wonder if you could just remind us of the mechanics on orders for next year. Is the order book open for all models and configurations? And then is pricing established or if goes for just - taking a bet on it and is that the same as every year this year?","Preston Feight","So I would say that the order book is open for all trucks and all models. We love taking orders for trucks, we enjoy it a lot. When I think about it in terms of the pricing being established, in the deals that we're discussing right now those ended up being with the customers and they end up being focused around what we have done previously and what their spec is and what we're doing. So those end up being worked through almost individually.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay, perfect. That\u2019s it. Thanks.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Salmon","Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott.","Preston Feight","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Salmon","A quick clarification question with regard to the build rate, am I hearing it right that you guys are basically planning on maintaining the third quarter level of production in the fourth quarter? Or is that some increase you're implying there in the back half guidance?","Preston Feight","I think that the firm\u2019s piece is the third quarter is going up and we watch where the fourth quarter - as we substantially are full, we'll watch what the fourth quarter does, but I don't expect to see any significant shifts.","Rob Salmon","That's helpful. And your preliminary comments about the order book and the strength looking out to next year, were you guys intimating that we could see revenue actually be up next year?","Preston Feight","I don't think we intimated next year.","Rob Salmon","Okay. And then just a couple of quick questions with regard to the used truck market. You said you saw it soften up a little bit. Could you describe if you\u2019re seeing that in one specific channel, i.e., kind of small fleets or kind of the owner operator end of the marketplace? And what sort of increase on year-over-year base are you seeing from a price realization currently would be helpful as well?","Preston Feight","Yes. As we think about it in terms of the PACCAR products Kenworth, Peterbilt, North America, DAF, and Europe are just - they command the premium, so it's a relative position I think competition doing real well. And then I think - as I said earlier, I think a lot of effect has to do with how many trucks are coming back in and what percent you retail those trucks out and we've been able to grow our retail percentage, especially North America, which has brought us good results. As far as the overall trends of the market, I think those majorities are difficult to plan forward to. But we'll watch them. We have a great team that's managing that business really well.","Rob Salmon","That's helpful. Final one which I guess kind of relates to the FinCo. As we a saw slight uptick in the provision for losses on receivables, obviously, still at a low level and that was a sequential uptick, so nicely improved on a year-over-year basis. What's driving that? Is that just some of the small carriers that you're seeing a little bit of softening in terms of their receivables or is this\u2026","Harrie Schippers","Most of that is due to the larger portfolio. But past dues remain really low, credit losses remained low, the portfolio has managed really well. So, we've got a lot of good customers that make money with their trucks and pay their bills on time.","Rob Salmon","Really helpful. Appreciate the time guys.","Preston Feight","Yes, you bet. Have a good day.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Raso","Thank you. Quick question. North America, I know you\u2019ve sliced at U.S., Canada how you get deliveries, but in your commentary about your backlog, can you just help us a bit with your US, Canada, or you want to define it as North America, your backlog year-over-year as we sit today, just some sense of the year-over-year in that position?","Preston Feight","Well, it\u2019s up substantially year-over-year from a normal cycle. Obviously, that's moderated from what had happened in 2018's 358,000 truck order intake or 458,000 truck order intake. So, its - if you look at it on a pure sequential year-over-year, it's probably down, but it's down from a level that was not sustainable so high. And so compared to normal levels, it's still very high and very strong, 73,000 trucks in the backlog and doing really well.","David Raso","I mean, clearly the industry is down. I mean the data we most all use, it's down about 17% year-over-year. I am just trying to get a feel is your backlog down less than the industry?","Preston Feight","Well, I think the best way to think about that David is to think about that in a percentage of backlog that Harrie talked about earlier, the 36% of the industry backlog which is if you call us a 30% market share and 36% industry backlog, means we have a very healthy backlog relative to our market share.","David Raso","Yes. I was just trying to figure out how much of that goes into 2020, how much is helping the fourth quarter? If the fourth quarter builds just have a normal seasonal less build days, but the daily rate stays the same, I would argue that's probably a little better than people were thinking.","I am just trying to get a feel while that helps the fourth quarter, what does it mean about 2020? But you're still speaking pretty constructively about your orders into 2020.","So, just trying to put a mosaic here together. But again, your backlog is doing better than the industry given the share gain obviously implied in that backlog versus the industry totals?","Preston Feight","Yes. I think you're characterizing it really well David.","David Raso","Okay.","Preston Feight","I think that's exactly right this that improve pretty well to that and we'll watch what 2020 does as it get closer to us.","David Raso","Very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Preston Feight","You bet.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ken Hastings","Yes. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you operator.","Preston Feight","Thanks everyone.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded; and if anyone has any objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning. I am pleased to share that 2014 was an excellent year for PACCAR with many records expanded product and service offerings and investments that provide the foundation for future growth. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $18.9 billion in 2014. Net income was $1.36 billion and increase of 16% versus a year ago and the Company\u2019s second best annual profit in history.","2014 was PACCAR\u2019s 76th consecutive year of earning a net income. These excellent results reflect the strongest North America heavy truck market retail sales since 2006. In addition, PACCAR parts and PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income. PACCAR celebrated several important milestones last year including Peterbilt's 75th anniversary. The delivery of Kenworth's one millions truck and the production of the one million DAF's cab in our Westerlo, Belgium factory.","More good news this week Kenworth\u2019s new vocational truck the T880 truck, equipped with the PACCAR MX-13 engine, earned \"2015 Truck of the Year\" from the American Truck Dealers. I am very proud of our 23,300 employees who deliver industry leading products and services to our customers everyday.","PACCAR\u2019s fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were quarterly record $5.1 billion and quarterly net income was $394 million. Net income increased 18% compared to the results generated in the fourth quarter last year. The positive contribution of all company segment enables PACCAR to obtain the highest operating margins in our industry and to deliver excellent shareholder returns. PACCAR declared cash dividends of $1.86 per share last year, a 9% increase compared to 2013. PACCAR\u2019s total return to shareholders was 18.3% last year. Stockholders equity at year end was a record $6.75 billion.","And during 2014, PACCAR repurchase 731,000 shares of stock for $42.7 million. PACCAR delivered 40,100 trucks during the fourth quarter, a 7% increase versus the third quarter. Vehicle deliveries in the first quarter this year will be 15% to 18% higher than the first quarter last year reflecting increased production in the U.S. and Canada. Truck and other margins are forecast to be 1% to 1.5% better than last years first quarter.","Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved excellent market share of 27.9% in the U.S. and Canadian heady-duty truck market in 2014. Retail sales totaled 250,000 units for the year. U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to increase to a range of 250,000 to 280,000 units this year driven by ongoing replacement demand and further fleet expansion which reflects continued economic growth. If recent order trends continue retail sales would be towards the higher end of the range.","DAF achieved a share of 13.8% in the European above 16-tonne truck market, which totaled 227,000 units last year. Looking at this year, we anticipate the European above 16-tonne truck market will be in a range of 200,000 to 240,000 vehicles. It is encouraging that the growth rate of the UK economy which is DAF\u2019s largest market is expected to grow by more than 2% this year. Lower diesel prices, low interest rates and other economic stimulus measures could improve European truck market conditions during the year.","PACCAR parts generated strong quarterly revenues of $789 million and 8% increase compared to the same quarter of the prior year. PACCAR parts quarterly pretax income was $130 million, an increase of 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage, high fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR parts.","For the full-year PACCAR parts achieved record revenues of $3.1 billion and record pretax income of $497 million. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $302 million in the fourth quarter slightly higher than a year ago.","PACCAR Financial Services fourth quarter pretax income was $96 million compared to $90 million earned last year. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $302 million in the fourth quarter slightly higher than a year ago. PACCAR Financial Services fourth quarter pretax incomes $96 compared to $90 million earned last year. The excellent results benefited from growth and asset balances and continuing strong portfolio performance.","For the full-year PACCAR Financial Services earned record pretax income of $370 million. PACCAR\u2019s capital spending of $300 million to $350 million this year will expand Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF product offerings enhance the PACCAR engine range and increase the operating efficiency and capacity of our factories and distribution centers.","Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $220 million to $260 million. As the company begins its 110th year we are in an excellent to growth with industry leading products and services.","Thank you. I\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan with Deutsche Bank.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Nolan","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I actually had two questions. Could you give us some color on what you would expect -- thanks for the color on Q1 -- but what you would expect for full-year margins to do year over year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think for the full-year or current thought is that margins would be up a bit over the 2014 level target 50 basis points.","Patrick Nolan","That's very helpful. And can you expand on what you're seeing as far as raw material costs? What kind of benefit you think that could be in 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, again we have a long-term agreements with almost all of our suppliers which manage the ups and downs of material cost movement so I suspect you know we will get some benefit but it will be muted because of the long-term arrangement.","Patrick Nolan","That's very helpful. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","Great thanks. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Steven Fisher","Great, thanks, good morning. Clearly there's a big pickup in the industry orders trends in the latter part of 2014. I'm just curious to what extent your order patterns were consistent with that trend as well and do you expect to see a pause in orders before the next reload and how long that pause might be?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Peterbilt and Kenworth\u2019s order intake in the fourth quarter was excellent, very consistent with industry order levels and as I said if the order trends continue we will see retail sales at the higher end of our range, but I don\u2019t think they will continue at the 123,000 order level which was the fourth quarter level, but they just cant continue that pace.","Steven Fisher","Okay and then can you just talk a little bit about how the slowdown in oil activity is affecting your business and kind of when assuming current conditions hold when you might see sort of the worst of the impact on it.","Ronald E. Armstrong","I guess our assessment of the impact of the lower oil prices is a positive for the U.S. economy and that will create additional consumer spending and consumer demand which I think will benefit freight volumes and be a positive for the industry.","Steven Fisher","Okay, thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning Tim.","Timothy W. Thein","Thank you good morning and good luck to your team there on Sunday.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Timothy W. Thein","So just first one Ron on pricing, truck pricing in North America. It looks like through the first nine months of the year that the realized pricing in U.S. and Canada was just under 2% and I\u2019m sure there is all kinds of other things that get include in that or don\u2019t that make it maybe a little bit less straightforward, but if we just use that call it 2% pricing for 2014 what would your expectations be for 2015 given that you enter with higher backlog and given your outlook for the markets overall.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well I don\u2019t know exactly how you get the 2%, but obviously we're participating in a competitive marketplace and we have great products, the performance of the new Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF products around the world has been excellent and we expect to be able to earn a very fair price and I just think pricing will continue to see levels that have been consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in 2014.","Timothy W. Thein","Okay got it and just your expectation is marginal increase, but on the back of the higher retail sales forecast for North America, are you still thinking about for parts growth in 2014 still in that kind of 4% to 7% range, is that still your expectation here for 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes I think something in that range in terms of parts deliveries will be something in that range for sure.","Timothy W. Thein","Okay, and just last one for me, Ron, just on Western Europe from a used perspective, used truck perspective, what if any impact are your dealers seeing just given the more difficult environment in Eastern Europe especially Russia? In the past it's been a pretty important outlet for used trucks. Has that led to any kind of backup in Western Europe?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No, used truck inventory levels are pretty normal I think just the volume of activity is probably dampening a little bit, but not anything of major consequence at all.","Timothy W. Thein","All right. Good, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, good morning guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Nicole DeBlase","So my first question is on R&D. I'm just curious what caused you to take up the midpoint R&D guidance by 7% and the 11% growth that you're projecting year on year. Are there any key projects there that we need to be thinking about?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Just continue to invest obviously throughout all phases of the business cycle, continue to expand the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF model offering as well as continue to invest in, our engine platforms will be launching the MX-11 in North America in the beginning of 2016 and preparing for the transition to greenhouse gas machines requirements in 2017, so that\u2019s the bulk of where our spending is.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, understood, thanks. And then my second question is just around build rates. Given the continued industry order strength we've seen, do you guys have plans to increase your build rates further in 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","The order rates continue I think there will be some potential for us to further increase our build rates as we go through the year.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Great, thanks I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen E. Volkmann","Hi, good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions especially since it's coming today from Massachusetts. So don't hold that against me. But I may not wish you good luck on the weekend but certainly good luck with the business. I'm wondering if I could just follow-up a little bit - you talked about the energy cost declines or price declines being ultimately good for the economy.","I'm just trying to figure out the other side of that equation because there's obviously a thesis out there that a fair amount of the truck strength in recent quarters has been driven by capacity increases in the energy segments and transportation of oil and gas and so forth. I'm just curious - I know nobody has to check a box to tell you what they are going to use the truck for when they buy it but you probably have a better sense than we do about how much has been actually going into those end markets and could be at risk going forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, I think about 10% or less of our volume is related to oil and gas. The oil and gas industry and that includes a lot of elements of that industry. So I think it, for sure, if oil prices stay at the levels exploration and production will be at lower activity levels and truck that are participate in that portion of the oil and gas segment. We\u2019ll have fewer orders, but that\u2019s a very small portion of what we do.","Stephen E. Volkmann","Okay, have you seen any of that in your discussions with clients yet? Are you seeing any orders canceled or anything like that?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No, it has been and remains pretty constant, year-on-year.","Stephen E. Volkmann","Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful. And then how far out are you booking now, and somebody wants to come you with new orders, or how far out as the backlog. How far out of the delivery times.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think we have a very healthy backlog and so probably look at second quarter.","Stephen E. Volkmann","Okay, great. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Jamie.","Operator","Jamie, if you\u2019re on mute. Please unmute your line.","Jamie Cook","Hello.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Hello.","Jamie Cook","Can you hear me?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, we can.","Jamie Cook","We\u2019re back. Sorry, we\u2019re back, sorry I don\u2019t know what happened there.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Jamie Cook","Sorry about that. I guess just a couple of questions. There's a lot of questions out there in terms of where the US truck cycle is relative to peak. What is your view on what inning of the ballgame we're in there? And then my second question just within Europe, can you talk about your ability or how we should think about your ability to pass through emissions Euro 6 over there this year and if that's a negative to margins? Thanks.","Ronald E. Armstrong","With respect to Europe pricing is stable and trucks are Euro 6 truck are performing excellently in the market lot of very positive feedback from the customers on the excellent reliability of the DAF product as well as the full efficiency. And they\u2019ve been DAF just recently introduced some additional announcements with Predictive Cruise Control and Predictive shifting that further enhanced fuel efficiency. So I think that will be a positive aspect of demand for DAF trucks in 2015.","With respect to the peak we don\u2019t have the ability to forecast that obviously the market has been improving over the last 15, 18 months and as long as the economy continues to grow. The freight demand is there - there will be demand for the excellent Kenworth and Peterbilt products and you know they continue to expand there model offerings to further enhance transition to the new cabs. So you know that the we can just continue to pure play is the market as the economy progresses.","Jamie Cook","And sorry just a follow-up in response to I think Steve Fisher's question, I think he asked about orders, the recent strength in orders and I think you made a comment that PACCAR had pretty good share. But I think there's some concern out there that the orders over the past three months were inflated by in particular one OEM. So can you comment on that or what would -- what do you think the reason why -- I know you don't view it as sustainable but why would orders be that strong for a three-month period if there wasn't anything funky in the order trends?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I can\u2019t comment on what the other OEM orders and take is all I can\u2019t says Peterbilt and Kenworth orders we\u2019re very strong and consistent with overall industry trends and so in great position to continue to take advantage of the strong freight in the demand for our great products.","Jamie Cook","All right. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Hey good morning guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning Seth.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning guys. I'm just wondering given the strength in orders and the volumes, can you talk about whether you're seeing any stress points in the supply chain at this point?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Suppliers continue to perform excellently and because that the ramp is really occurred over 15 month to 18 month they have been able to adjust and adopt their capabilities to fit our needs and so we see that continuing for the foreseeable future.","Seth Weber","Okay, thanks. And then I guess within your backlog, can you comment are you seeing any evidence of the smaller owner-operators getting back into the market? I know that you've talked about that market not definitionally being different this cycle versus prior but are you seeing any come back from the smaller operators?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I would say that the order volume that we\u2019ve experience over the last several quarters has been broadly based and includes demand not just from large fleets but also from the vocational segment as well as some of the smaller size fleets in the market so it\u2019s more or less a broad based order book that we have.","Seth Weber","Okay, thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning Andy.","Andrew M. Casey","Hey good morning everybody. And I\u2019ll send a reluctant Boston base good luck to you this weekend also. So first I didn\u2019t hear the margin comment very clearly. Was that specific to gross margin?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes.","Andrew M. Casey ","Okay thanks.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes.","Andrew M. Casey ","And then in North America and just we\u2019ve seen these cycles before and you know at some point pricing goes up, you are kind of suggesting modest price increase potential, what do you think has to happen in the market to enable more aggressive pricing potential?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think the pricing is reasonable given the market conditions, I don\u2019t see major movements, I think the length of the backlog is clearly a factor in how price reacts in the market and I would say backlogs were in good share at this point. We don\u2019t see any major adjustment in those levels as we go forward.","Andrew M. Casey ","Okay, thanks and then if we can go over to the EU from what we can see freight seems to be stable to slowly improving, is that translating into any order improvement and how specifically did orders trend in Q4 versus last year if you could share that.","Ronald E. Armstrong","The orders are pretty consistent as we look at the quarters over 2014, orders are pretty stable and I think as we talked about with the lower fuel prices historically low interest rates, some of the stimulus measures that could have a benefit for orders as we progress through the year obviously the situation in Russia has impacted demand for that market, but its trending positively and we will see how the year progresses, but I think there are some positive things that could impact it.","Andrew M. Casey ","Okay thank you on that and then lastly if I look at the share buyback activity there wasn\u2019t a whole lot in 2014, could you help us understand how you are thinking about the potential for the upcoming year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","As we just have a long-term view of periodically buying back shares and we will continue to take that perspective and buy shares as we feel its appropriate in the marketplaces we\u2019ve progress into 2015.","Andrew M. Casey ","Okay thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Ross.","Ross Gilardi","Yes, good morning. Thanks, Ron. Just a couple of questions maybe a little bit more on Europe. If you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in different countries and clearly the overall market is still pretty soft. Europe has been weak for many years now. I'm curious where you think we are in fleet age in Europe and if we do get a little bit of a pickup in the European economy do you see any realistic prospects for a decent replacement cycle kicking in the next several years?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think that\u2019s a good observation Ross there are lots of trucks that were put in the market in the 2006, 2007, 2008 timeframe and while it\u2019s difficult to find somebody who has an independent measure of that I think the age of the fleet is extending in Europe and so with some good healthy demand, positive demand that could trigger a healthier replacement activity.","Ross Gilardi","And then could you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing across the continent?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think again as I mentioned Russia the impact there that\u2019s - we\u2019ll see how that develops during the course of the year. UK for us which is our largest market impacted by the pre-buy in 2014, but with the good economy we are off to a good start in the UK with our DAF business and Northern Europe as you mentioned or somebody else mentioned the freight activity is up year-over-year as we look at the activity through Germany and it\u2019s up 2% to 3% for the year last year and continue to show increases in the fourth quarter. So there is a lot of good elements that are present and I think if things can develop to take some of the uncertainty away about how the future might react I think the European potential for upturn is there.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, thanks Ron. And then I don't know if you can comment on this or not but I'll try anyway. On the competition investigation, I know you can't say anything on the dollar amount or speculate on that but can you give us any sense as your best guess on timing as to when you might be able to provide an estimate? Because obviously several of your competitors have already taken a stab at that?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, we included an update in the press release on our valuation of the European commission and I don\u2019t just don\u2019t have anything else to add at this point.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Andy. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Ron, so can you maybe walk us around the world outside of the US in Europe? Your other truck markets have continued to improve after maybe a tough time a year or so ago. So maybe talk to us about Australia, Mexico, these other markets because they do seem like they're getting better.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Australia is great, market for Kenworth and DAF. We have about a 25% share that market continue to be the market leader. So we are optimistic about our opportunities in that area. The Europe, Australian economies have been impacted obviously by the mining activity and some downturn there. But we think again this in long-term, we are in great shape in Australia.","Mexico again we are market leader there, with over 40% share of that heavy-duty market. And we\u2019ll continue to see I think as the year progresses, Mexican economies closely tied with the US economy and so. We expect to see them benefit for some of the activity that\u2019s going on in the US, so upside there.","And so we talked about Europe, and Brazil is, so early days for us and we continue our study progress and dealers continue to finish their facilities and begin operations out of their permanent facility. So that the progression of our efforts in South America continue as well.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, that's helpful and Ron, if I could look back at the fourth quarter again, you had guided to I think 5% to 7% up in deliveries. It looks like your truck revenue was up about 5% and the December build was down. It was very strange in the industry. It was probably because of the weird holiday weeks. But it does seem like the industry is being pretty careful with increasing build rates. So maybe you can just comment on PACCAR specifically. Is that sort of the case was build what you thought it would be? Did the holidays mess things up more than you thought? Like any color there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","It was right. We built exactly what we had planned to build when we talked in the last call, we talked about 5% to 7% increase in production. And we were increased at 7% in terms of trucks produced. There was some offset with the effective foreign currency movement in the quarter. But that\u2019s we\u2019re right inline and as I mentioned we will see strong production increase in the first quarter of this compared to the first quarter of last year, in the tune of 15% to 18%.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And how should we think about currency for you guys in 2015 in terms of impact on the business?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Clearly, when we operate in lot of countries around the world in the translation of those foreign currencies into U.S. dollar, impacts revenue and profit numbers but we do have an offset we purchase a fair amount of components from European suppliers that we are using our U.S. products. So there is a bit of natural hedge there.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks, Ron.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JP Morgan.","Ann P. Duignan ","Hi, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan ","I was going to say what's going on this weekend that I don't know about and then I thought oh yes, there is a big football game.","Ronald E. Armstrong","It will be exciting.","Ann P. Duignan ","I guess. I wanted to follow-up on the last question. Your European share was down to 13.8% from 16.2% in 2013. And I wanted to just address that in terms of is that because UK is your largest market and the UK was messed up because of the emissions changes and also how do we think about the competitiveness of the UK business since you produce in the UK but you sell in euros and is that a competitive disadvantage over there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So the effect - the market share DAF was at 15% in the second half of the year, the year was really effected by as you mentioned the pre-buy and the transition rules that excited in our two largest markets which is the Netherlands and the UK. So that impacted off share we expect this year that we are going to return back to our 2013 share levels and so in the UK economy as I mentioned is one of the stronger economies in the region. So again we are off to good start there and expect to have a good year in the UK.","Ann P. Duignan ","Okay and then competitiveness, the products you build in UK but sell in euros is there any\u2026","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, we built trucks on the continent that get sold into the UK we built truck in the UK that go to the continent and again we have a pretty natural offsetting effect of those trucks in the movements back in forth.","Ann P. Duignan ","Okay, thank you. That's helpful to understand.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure.","Ann P. Duignan ","I just wanted to also ask about -- you talked about less than 10% of your business being exposed to oil and gas and you said broadly oil and gas. Do you include things like the Canadian oil sands when you talk about oil and gas exposure and could you just address the business there? Is there any risk of cancellations -- anything that we might be missing on the oil and gas exposure as we go through 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","When we talk about 10% we're principally talking about trucks that are sold into production activities, those would be water trucks, sand trucks, those types of applications. For sure, you know the level of new permitting is off and so we would expect some impact in the second half of the year, but don\u2019t see any significant impact on our backlog at this point. Again, on balance we feel that lower oil prices overall are good for PACCAR, what drives freight in the U.S. economy is a large function of consumer demand and so on balance we think it\u2019s a very positive things for the company.","Ann P. Duignan","Yes, I guess investors concern is that the two might not happen coincidentally but we might see a slowdown in oil and gas activity and then later in the year consumer activity pick up, so just trying to get a sense of how to put that into model. So I appreciate it and good luck on Sunday. At least I think the game is Sunday, is it?","Ronald E. Armstrong","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning Jerry.","Jerry Revich","Hi good morning and good afternoon everyone. Ron I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about the drivers of the 50 basis points in margin improvement 2015 versus 2014, how much of that is just mechanics around the warranty, any mix headwind of higher production rates in Europe versus flat to down or production up in the U.S. and flat to down in Europe. Can you just maybe give us a bit more of the bridge there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Jerry obviously the margin really reflects the stronger anticipated market in North America, we are going to be operating for sure for the first part of the year and probably throughout the year at a higher production level than we were at in the first half of 2014. So the benefits of that higher production volume is what's playing through to the margin improvement.","Jerry Revich","Okay, and then you alluded to earlier on euro impact on net imports into the U.S. for Europe, what proportion of your U.S. total truck component costs on euros roughly?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don\u2019t have that number Jerry, its not a great number, but its there is - it\u2019s a sizable enough number that there is a natural hedge that we have.","Jerry Revich","Okay and Ron, you touched on it a moment ago in terms of your guidance I guess implies a year-over-year flat to decline production rate in the North American market. And I'm just wondering are you folks planning for slower demand or is that a function of, look, it's early in the year; let's see what another quarter or two of orders looks like before we get more aggressive about the guidance?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don\u2019t think I understand your point Jerry where the North American market last year was 250,000, Peterbilt and Kenworth had 28% share that market we are looking next year at 250 to 280 if the demand level continues maybe towards the higher end of that and Peterbilt and Kenworth have great products and I think the opportunity continue to have strong share position in the market. So we are going to have - if that market is there we\u2019ll deliver more trucks in 2015 then we did last year.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I guess it just comes back down to on a year-over-year basis your production in the U.S. should be up somewhere in the 30% range. So compared to the full-year guidance at the midpoint or even at the high-end of not that strong growth implies a potential flattish back half of 2015. Does that make sense?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I\u2019m not sure where all of your numbers, but again we\u2019re going to be able to participate in the market growth and again because of our product positioning we have opportunity to have a very strong share that U.S. Canadian market.","Jerry Revich","All right. And to switch gears a bit, we've spent a lot of time over the past couple of years talking about the expanded range of products for the European markets. Can you just talk about the traction that you're getting in the marketplace? As you alluded to earlier, a lot of noise in the 2014 market share numbers. Maybe you could just talk about how the specific launches have gone and what the acceptance rate has been.","Ronald E. Armstrong","It\u2019s been excellent, the XF product we launched that in 2013 and so it\u2019s been in the market now for over 18 months. The LF and the vocational CF product was launched late 2013, early 2014 and again very well received in the market, DAF introduced some enhancement at the Hanover truck show and has launched those enhancements now into the market in the beginning of 2015 with predictive cruise, and low deck tractors, the CF with the silent package. So lots of good feedback from dealers and customers on the fuel efficiency, the reliability of the products, so DAF is very well positioned with its product as it moves.","Jerry Revich","All right, thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO.","Joel G. Tiss","Hi guys, how's it going?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good.","Joel G. Tiss","That's good. Great questions and even better answers. I'm not used to this. The lower spending that you guys - it's just slightly lower in your leasing business. Can you give us any of the dynamics behind that? Are there more used trucks in the market or are you just tempering your growth outlook a little bit?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I\u2019m sure. I am following the question, Joel.","Joel G. Tiss","On your cash flow statement you spent $1.2 billion in 2014 on lease vehicles versus almost $1.4 billion in 2013. So I just wondered if there was any sort of message in that little bit lower spending in a growing market.","Ronald E. Armstrong","No I think that\u2019s a mix shift of the method of financing of vehicles, both a bit in Europe and a bit in North America. So it\u2019s really just the way that the customers have opted to finance their product.","Joel G. Tiss","Okay, and then since almost everything else has been asked, can you give us any sense if the energy-related vehicles are higher margin or similar margin or lower than the overall segment?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Let\u2019s a similar.","Joel G. Tiss","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Hi, good morning this is Joe Vruwink on the line for David.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph D. Vruwink","I'm in Green Bay Packer country, so you'll excuse me if I don't wish anyone good luck this weekend.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, that was a tough five minutes of football for you.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Very tough, but moving on. In gaining back market share in Europe, which sounds like it's your plan for 2015, is that just a function of country mix and the UK expected to be stronger or are there customers or applications you've identified that are helping as well?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it\u2019s a combination of both in country mix and the reception that the Euro 6 product has received in the marketplace we will support DAF\u2019s targets for 2015.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Okay. Are you seeing any sort of shift in let's say the head-to-head matchups at the high-end? I think one of your high-end Swedish competitors gained some market share in 2014?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Again, I think the 2014 share numbers were really impacted by the level of Euro 5 the sales in the 2014 year and which countries you know your particular was in. So 2014 is probably not representative of sort of the long-term trends.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Okay. And then shifting to the U.S., when making the comment that maybe for the industry production rates need to stay at or can stay at Q4 levels into 2015, and that's kind of where you get the growth coming from, order rates in 2014 were well above production rates. So it just rough math I think there would still be quite a few units in the backlog just maintaining Q4 production rates that would still really be targeted for 2016 at that point. It kind of goes back to the earlier comment on OEM discipline. But is that kind of a reasonable trajectory where OEMs are planning already for a 2016 delivery cadence?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I would say the vast majority of our backlog is that\u2019s going to be built in 2015 if that\u2019s your question I\u2019m not certain we are following it.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Juts in terms of there is already a pretty sizable backlog across the industry, if orders maintain even reasonable rates let's say a low 300 or at 300,000 rates it would seem like there is obviously year the truck market is know for ratching it up to mid high 300 and then crashing back down, it seems like the plans across the industry are for something more gradual than that where a good growth number in 2015, but certainly not a ratcheting back down in 2016.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well I think that cycles in our business over the last decade have been both economic, but more importantly regulatory based upon the implementation of emission standards and as we kind of look out over the next five years at least, we don\u2019t see significant impact from any regulatory requirements. So the market demand for commercial vehicles is going to be largely based upon the economics in the country.","Joseph D. Vruwink","Okay great and then one housekeeping item, it looks like your depreciation expense stepped up in Q4, is that the right level that you are thinking about into next year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, I think that amount in Q4 annualizes probably a pretty indicative number for next year.","Joe Vruwink","Okay, thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer","Hi good morning guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Robert Wertheimer","Two quick questions, definitional really for you, I think the press release said 37% PACCAR penetration, you have obviously been on a very positive trend. I assume you have now just stated that for U.S., Canada and Mexico as appose to what you used to with U.S. Canada and you are still gaining share.","Ronald E. Armstrong","That really is a U.S. and Canada metric yes. Yes in Mexico we launched the engine last year very well received by our customers there and so it\u2019s growing percentage penetration in the Mexican market as well.","Robert Wertheimer","But in the fourth quarter press release do you happen to know if you included Mexico in the share of 37?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No, that was U.S. and Canada.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay I\u2019ll come back and circle back afterwards then. Do you have any capacity constraints on that or are you continuing to see customer preference shift or is there any - have you seen yet any capacity preference limit to how far you can go?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, we have two great engine factories, one in Eindhoven and one in Columbus, Mississippi and both can produce the full line of PACCAR engine and so we have the ability to produce engines around the world to that support our needs in whatever market it might be. So capacity is in excellent shape. Our capacity for both the truck business and for engine production is in great shape.","Robert Wertheimer","Excellent, thank you. And then if I may when you take an order in November or December for delivery next year, just mechanically speaking, does that have a potential to have next year's pricing in it or is it always existing year pricing? Thanks. ","Ronald E. Armstrong","Typically if we take a multi-year order there is some factor that's used for the subsequent year in the pricing that is in the order.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with ISI.","David Raso","Hello, thinking about your production mix geographically, the near-term build schedule, can you help us with - it seems like you're implying deliveries are down about 8% fourth quarter to first quarter, just backing into the math that you gave us year-over-year. Can you help us understand the geographic mix in that down 8%?","Ronald E. Armstrong","The first quarter would be down about 5% from fourth quarter levels with primarily related to Europe.","David Raso","Okay and you're implying the gross margins are down a bit sequentially. It looks like the absolute levels of deliveries are down, so there's some maybe just overhead issue. But can you help us understand from a mix perspective I'm generalizing, but I would think North America at this high level would be running better margins than Europe. So why if the mix is more towards North America sequentially should I have down gross margin sequentially?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Purely reflects the production volumes in the first quarter.","David Raso","Okay and then moving further into the year, maybe if you gave it I apologize, I missed it the full-year deliveries. How are you characterizing full-year deliveries 2015 versus 2014?","Ronald E. Armstrong","We\u2019ve given our market range and we expect our shares to be good in all our markets and so that\u2019s was the impact of the primary drivers of our volume numbers in our business.","David Raso","In Europe the build schedule versus the industry say market share was flat. Early in 2014 dealers were selling out their inventory of Euro 5, would that suggest your builds in 2015 in Europe should be better than the industry rate? Because the industry number you're giving is sales, but again they were selling out of inventory in the first quarter of this year. So are your builds going to be above the industry?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So, the mid part of our estimate is pretty comparable to last year\u2019s level. We hope to - expect to see some share improvement, and so we hope that our deliveries and registrations for 2015 or maybe a bit ahead of 2014 level.","David Raso","Last question on pricing. A little disappointed what I'm hearing about the 2016 models on pricing. And we all understand what's going on with more vertically integrated drivetrains and who's trying to catch up on lost market share. But let me just ask you point-blank, are you surprised how the pricing is developing? Because usually with this kind of backlog, this kind of extension of build schedules, delivery lead-times I'm hearing 1.5% to 2.5% price increase for the 2016 models is relatively disappointing between you and I.","So just trying to understand when those prices are set: first, is that the right magnitude? Second, maybe elaborate on why do you think that is. And then third, can we see pricing improve as the year goes on? I'm just not sure how much - when you set a price can we ratchet back some traditional dealer discounts or so forth during the year? Because again, I'd be hoping to get more pricing in 2015 than say 2% in North America.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, I don't know what the source of your pricing information is, but obviously Peterbilt and Kenworth have great products, that its all based on the value of proposition with our customers and we think we offer a great value proposition with the industries best truck as well as the industries best fuel efficiency.","David Raso","Would you disagree with my sources on that kind of price increase? I'd be happy to hear I'm wrong, but hopefully to the upside. I'm just trying to understand if those are the right numbers, again I'd be thinking we can get more. But can you at least help us order of magnitude, do you think you'll be able to get more pricing than I'm alluding to or less?","Ronald E. Armstrong","David, again great products and competitive offering and great value for our customer, so.","David Raso","Okay, we'll take it off-line. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research","Neil Frohnapple","Hey, good morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Neil.","Neil Frohnapple","Do you have the new truck delivery breakdown by geography in Q4?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, we do, just a second. In the US and Canada we delivered 22,200 trucks in the further quarter, and Europe it was 12,100 and in Mexico, South America, Australia and other it was 5,800 trucks.","Neil Frohnapple","Great, thanks. And just a follow-up on an earlier question on the MX penetration here in the U.S. and Canada. The 37% rate in Q4 was in line with Q4 of 2013 and it seems like we've been in that 35% to 40% range for all of 2014. I mean do you still anticipate this installation rate to increase over time? And I guess what do you think is preventing faster adoption of that product closer to your 50% medium-term target?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think we will see increased over time, it\u2019s a great engine and it\u2019s really a matter of getting more and more of the customers. We are significantly invested maybe in Cummins engines or another brand to get in the vehicle and experience the engine. And so, once they do that we will continue to see conquest business over time and the engine with its horsepower capabilities in the torque capabilities of the engine its very well suited to 75%, 80% of our customer need. So we will see it continue to develop over time.","Neil Frohnapple","And just a follow-up, are you guys planning on doing anything different this year to try to help accelerate the adoption or is the go-to-market strategy kind of the same?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it\u2019s very consistent.","Neil Frohnapple","Great, thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","Good morning, gentlemen.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning, Ted.","Ted Grace","I was hoping to ask a question on PACCAR Financial. Just as we look forward to 2015, any handholding you can give us on how to think about the pretax contribution, how net interest margins may kind of flow year on year and maybe just start there?","Unidentified Company Representative","The portfolio has grown during the course of the year, portfolio pretty well attract the demand for trucks. So if the truck demand based on the market assumptions that we see that there is probably further portfolio growth as we enter into 2015 and portfolios performance very well past dues have been below 1% now for over two years and we see it continue to perform well and borrowing rates are an historic low levels and we will continue to take advantage of that to support the sale of Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF products and support our dealers in the floor plan activities.","Ted Grace","Yes, I guess the demand side is a little easier to calibrate on. But I'm just wondering the spread any handholding you can give us on how we should think about spread in the margin?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don\u2019t think it will be significantly different and what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years.","Ted Grace","Okay. Thanks helpful. And then maybe just a cleanup question. Can you talk about SG&A and tax rates as we think about 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","SG&A one of our strengths as a company is rigorous over side of our spending activities and our plans and warehouses and offices around the world and we\u2019ll continue to maintain that rigor. I think SG&A would be at levels comparable to 2014 and the tax rate as we look forward probably in the 32% to 33% range is we look to 2015.","Ted Grace","Super. Well best of luck this quarter with the exception of Sunday.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Reena Krishhnan","Hi, good morning, it's actually Reena Krishnan sitting in for Scott Group.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Reena Krishhnan","Hi and I apologize if you may have already answered this, but I just wanted to get a sense in terms of how you're thinking about deliveries for the year. I don't know if you guys ever give color on this, but within your expectations for deliveries, how much of that is -- like how many - how much do have confirmed orders I guess already for the full-year? If that makes sense.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Our market estimate for the various markets that we participate in. we\u2019ve identified what those are and we expect to have good share positions in those markets and so that really can give the expectations for units as we look forward for the year. Backlogs are in excellent and we well positioned to take advantage of the market as it progresses during the year.","Reena Krishhnan","Okay thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Potter with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander Potter","Hi guys. I was wondering if you could comment on this recent drop in fuel pricing and whether that impacts peoples' decision to downsize their engine to a 13 liter.","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don\u2019t think that has much impact, I think they are looking because fuel even at the reduction fuel is still the first or second biggest expense in their P&L and so I think they are always looking to get the most advantageous cost level that they can and the MX engine combined with the Peterbilt, Ken T680, DAF trucks provided excellent value proposition for those customers.","Alexander Potter","Okay, and then another question I guess along those same lines, saving cost on the fuel bill. Do you think given the decline in diesel pricing that's a natural gas trend is on the back burner?","The natural gas has been a niche product and I think it will continue, we don\u2019t see any dramatic shit in that but our Peterbilt and Kenworth teams have the leading market share in the natural gas products and so we are well positioned to provide those. For our customers it\u2019s just not going to be a high percentage of our build.","Alexander E. Potter","And not willing to hazard a guess regarding whether 2015 natural gas truck demand might be up, down or flat versus last year? ","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it will be similar.","Alexander E. Potter","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter.","Michael Shlisky","Good morning, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning Mike.","Michael Shlisky","I wanted to start off here with a quick question to follow-up on a previous one. Can you maybe just quantify the fourth-quarter impact of FX on your top line and on your pretax income I guess both euro and of course the Canadian dollar as well? ","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, for the quarter the impact on revenues was about $160 million and pretax profit was about $13 million.","Michael Shlisky","Great, and secondly I wanted to ask about your 2014 dividends, historically you\u2019ve been talking about 45% to 25% payout rate of your annual net income in your overall dividend and just. And just going with what was put out in today\u2019s release and we\u2019ll put out back in December. I don\u2019t think you kind of hit the very low end of that range, paying out about 45% of your full-year net income. I was kind of wondering are you holding onto the cash for any reason. Is there any reason why didn't want to go towards the higher end there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think we\u2019ve been very consistent over time and we evaluate that on a ongoing basis and consult with the board, the board decides what levels will you provide dividends and so we have a long track record since 1941. Paying a dividend to our shareholders and we\u2019ll continue I think with that practice for the foreseeable future.","Michael Shlisky","All right, thanks guys. Good luck on Sunday.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Thank you.","Michael Shlisky","And I guess keep those football pumps handy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kwame Webb with Morningstar","Kwame Webb","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning.","Kwame Webb","So the first one for me is what are you guys expecting in terms of Brazilian production rates for 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think we will see, be steady and up because as we gain more of our dealers, finishing their permanent facilities, they will be able to enhance their business, which should translate into additional demand for our trucks, our DAF trucks.","Kwame Webb","Okay. And when should we expect a more aggressive production ramp there? Should we expect it to be a 2016 or a 2017 type event?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it will be steady. ","Kwame Webb","Okay.","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it will be very steady.","Kwame Webb","And then just the other one for me on automatic transmission adoption, I know the penetration rate had been ticking higher over the last couple years. Kind of curious to get your thoughts on 2015.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think it will continue to increase in penetration, as this time goes on, both for fuel economy reasons and for driver reasons, very efficient transmissions and they are very easy to drive. So we will continue to see, increasing acceptance of those markets in the markets.","Kwame Webb","In terms of your own order mix, what would 2013 versus 2014 would look like.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Probably about a 10% increase over the course of the year, so fairly significant.","Kwame Webb","Okay, great, thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Pollack with NWQ Investments.","Martin Pollack","Wow, a lot of questions have been asked. When you look at Europe, your forecast for European I guess sales is down from 2014. If you look at where the truck cycle in Europe has been and it's totally in a different place where the North America cycle has been and you wonder then - what is the opportunity for some meaningful recovery in Europe? And how is it likely to be affected by what's gone on in the Eastern Bloc with Russia?","At the same time, your market share 13.8% seems to be I think considerably lower than the sort of 16% or 17% range you've seen. So if there is upside in PACCAR is it in Europe? And if it's not this year is it next year that we should be seeing some recovery? That's the first question. The second one has to do just with North America. The sustainability of the cycle clearly in 2006-2008, we had the pre-buy impact, I think double ordering. Can you just talk about those dynamics here in terms of the health of the cycle? And even if it's 2015 is a peak, can 2016 be still a fairly strong environment?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well I think when you think about Europe as we commented ion our products, the Euro6 products had been very well received by our customers and DAF continues to make enhancements both in terms of application fuel efficiency and so they are very well positioned to take advantage of any uptick in the market and as I mentioned with the lower fuel prices, low interest rates there is a potential for the market to improve, I think it\u2019s a matter of people getting confident about how the future may look for them and once they gain that confidence just as we saw in the past years here in North America, once they gain that confidence they will be willing to be more aggressive in placing that order.","In North America, we said past cycles have been impacted by some of the emissions change , we don\u2019t see those kinds of impact and so the truck market will pretty well track the economic development as we see them occur and right now obviously the economic forecast for 2015 are good and we expect to have a positive impact on the size of the market for this year.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I would like to thank everyone for their excellent questions. And thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR, and joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller. [Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported improved revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2014. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.4 billion, and quarterly net income was $274 million and after-tax return on revenues of 6.3%. Net income increased 16% compared to the results generated in the first quarter last year. I'm very proud of our 21,700 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","2014 marks another major milestone for PACCAR, with Peterbilt celebrating its 75th anniversary. The company's 75-year tradition of excellence and innovation has established an uncompromising focus to deliver the highest levels of product quality, customer satisfaction and return on investment.","PACCAR delivered 31,800 trucks during the first quarter, a 4% increase versus the first quarter last year and in line with our expectations. The improvement reflects increased truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada due to the ongoing replacement of the aging truck population and improving construction in automotive sectors. Looking ahead, we expect to increase truck deliveries in the second quarter by 8% to 10% compared to the first quarter.","Second quarter gross margins should be somewhat higher than the first quarter, reflecting the benefits of higher production levels and improved operating efficiency. It is encouraging that housing starts in the U.S. are over 900,000 units, and there's growth in nonresidential construction. Other good economic news is that U.S. auto production should be around 16 million vehicles this year. These positive trends should benefit truck demand in North America. U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 220,000 to 240,000 units this year, up from 212,000 units in 2013.","The stronger market reflects ongoing replacement demand and some expansion in industry fleet capacity due to continued strong freight fundamentals. Industry truck orders for the U.S. and Canada in the first quarter were 80,000 units. Economic news in Europe is trending positively, with GDP growth expectations for this year of 1%. Freight in Germany, as measured by the amount index, has risen 5% compared to the same period last year. Europe's greater than 16-tonne market is projected to be in a range of 200,000 to 230,000 units. Customers in Europe accelerated purchases of Euro 5 vehicles in the second half of last year and are adjusting to the increased prices of Euro 6 trucks. Production of DAF trucks in Brazil is progressing, with production levels expected to increase gradually through 2014.","PACCAR's Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $727 million, a 9% increase compared to $667 million in the same quarter of the prior year. PACCAR Parts' quarterly pretax income was $112 million, an increase of 18% compared to the $95 million earned in the first quarter of 2013. The strong results were driven by increased freight tonnage, improved fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts.","PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $294 million in the first quarter, comparable to a year ago. PACCAR Financial's first quarter pretax income was $86 million compared to $80 million earned a year ago. The improved results benefited from growth in asset balances and excellent portfolio performance.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $2.2 billion in new products and facilities in the last 3 years. PACCAR began production of the new vocational Kenworth T880 and that Peterbilt Model 567 trucks in late 2013. These new vehicles expand PACCAR's offering in the construction, utility and refuse markets and complement the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt Model 579 on-highway trucks launched in 2012. The launch of the new DAF XF, CF and LF Euro 6 vehicles in 2013 strengthen's DAF's position as the leading provider of integrated transport solutions.","PACCAR's capital spending of $300 million to $350 million this year is targeted at enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency of our assembly facilities. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $200 million to $250 million. PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest-quality products and services in the industry and by investing in new geographic regions.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually this is Andrew on behalf of Jamie. So I just have a quick question. Can you just comment quickly on your parts business in the quarter? And what you're seeing particularly across each region?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, the Parts business had good growth, I'd say slightly a little bit stronger in the U.S. and Canadian markets compared to some of our other markets, but good growth in really all regions for the quarter. And I think that's evidence of the improving freight conditions that we've seen both in North America and Europe.","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then just along those lines, with the -- given how the U.S. has trended going forward, what do you guys see for the remainder of the year in terms of just the North American market?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Are you talking about the truck market or the parts business?","Andrew Buscaglia - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, trucks.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Our projection for U.S. and Canada is in the range of 220,000 to 240,000 units. And so we're thinking that the market will progressively improve as we go through the year and we have -- and we talked about our planned production increase of 8% to 10% in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jeffries.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm going to drill in a little if you let me on this production increase of 8% to 10% in the second quarter. Can you just give us a rough magnitude of how that breaks down sort of, U.S. versus Europe, and then maybe even heavy versus medium, if you would?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I'd say, on the heavy versus medium, I would say that the increases are comparable across those categories. And in terms of geography, I'd say the increase in the U.S. and Canada is probably a little bit higher than that average percentage, and Europe is a little bit below that.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit, I think historically, once we hit some sort of inflection point, I'm not sure really where that is but we would expect to get a little bit better pricing as you start to build the backlog further out, are we there yet? Is that happening or is it maybe something different this cycle? Just any comment on that.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think, as we've progressed through the market, we continue to work closely with our customers and be very competitive in the marketplace, providing the best solutions. You look at things like our industry-leading residual values, allows us to provide a very competitive price to our customers with the lowest operating life cycle costs of any of the manufacturers. And so we can provide a very attractive proposition, and we'll continue to gauge the market and price accordingly.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","All right, maybe more simply then, is pricing up year-over-year or flat or down?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I would say it's maybe up a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I would just wonder if you talk a little bit more about Europe, some of your other competitors have kind of suggested things, maybe slightly better, could you talk a little bit more about DAF orders during the quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure, as we transition from Euro 5 to Euro 6, I'd say orders started off in the first quarter, soft in January, we've seen progressive improvement through February and through March, and we discussed some good momentum as we head through the rest of the year so we feel good about DAF's continued strong position in the European market.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then just shifting to Brazil, I mean, obviously, the economy faces challenges there. Is it making it tougher for you to gain traction there? Many of your peers seem to be complaining about the slowing environment and pricing pressure, obviously you're kind of starting more from a ground zero position, but what's your thoughts on Brazil?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, I think Brazilian market does have its challenges but as you mentioned, we're in a startup mode, really focused on getting our production, our distribution network well-established, doing it all right first time, if you will. And so market conditions aren't as significant to us and we'll continue to progress in our build plans, shouldn't affect our plans for 2014.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, I'm just wondering, could you give a little more color on why you think orders have been so strong in North America so far year-to-date? What are you hearing about -- from customers on the sustainability? Is the issue that your customers are finally getting pricing power for the first time in a long time and therefore are more willing to invest, but anything you provide there will be helpful.","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think, it's a matter of confidence. You look at the customers today and over the past years, there's been a lot of uncertainty about how significant the economic improvements might be and what might the government do. And I think some of the positive things that the government was able to achieve in the fourth quarter last year, with solid budget plans without stopping the government. And so I think people feel better about the ability to support, keeping their trucks active and being able to get fair rates off to get for their business. So I think it's a matter of confidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I ask you about your other revenues? You talked and broken it up in the past about geography, maybe if you could do that again. The number sequentially continued to come down a little bit. Has there been an impact on you Russia business and is Mexico still kind of weak, when it comes down to it?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think there is some softness in Mexico. We saw their economic situation was challenging in the second half of last year, but I think we're starting to see some signs of recovery in that market and Australia has been up and down a little bit with the effects of the mining industry, but starting to see some solid business there. So I think we see some of the other markets starting to show some positive signs.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, and then maybe can you talk about the penetration of the new products that you had over the last 6 months, a lot of vocational trucks? I would assume that they come with modestly higher margins and maybe you could talk about the overall construction market and its receptivity to these trucks. Have you seen a pretty good growth rate out of these trucks here in the early going?","Robert J. Christensen","This is Bob Christensen. So the impact of productions with our new models, at Kenworth and Peterbilt, is about 50% new model production. Of course, DAF is almost 100% with our new Euro 6. With respect to the vocational market, we're seeing strong growth in the overall market, and both Kenworth and Peterbilt have high penetration levels. And so we're selling a lot more vocational trucks than we have over the last 3 or 4 years, and that's good for PACCAR and good for our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk about the margin ramp over the course of the year, presumably as Europe ramps up, margins should improve each quarter sequentially from here. But can you just help us with the order of magnitude for improvement in the second quarter? Can you come close to the 13% gross margins you were delivering last year? Do you need a healthier European truck production environment before we could talk about that margin range?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think we see second margins probably improving somewhere in the 20 to 40 basis point range for the second quarter, continue to be able to leverage our cost structure. DAF in the first quarter transitioned its production from roughly 15% Euro 6 vehicles to 80% Euro 6 vehicles. And so that transition now is done, and DAF -- the DAF team did a tremendous job of really transitioning that product line and achieving great production efficiency as they transition. And so we will continue to see -- depends on the market conditions and et cetera, but we're well-positioned to the extent that we're able to continue to increase our production levels, we'll achieve some level of operating efficiency with that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in Brazil, I know you're all-makes parts business is it a big part of distributor build out strategy? Is that a significant part of the parts franchise where you can give us a sense for how that's going and just give us, if you could and update on the broader distributor build out there?","Robert J. Christensen","So the Parts business will start slow in Brazil and will build out over a long period of time. Certainly, the all-makes program that you refer to is an important part of our strategy. We have 20 dealer locations in Brazil, and they are all beginning to sell both trucks and parts. But it's going to be a slow ramp-up over the next several quarters, if not years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And from a capital deployment standpoint, Ron, I think you in the past spoken about a 45% to 50% net income payout ratio, is that still the way to think about business and any other capital uses that we should be thinking about?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Obviously, first point of investment is back into our products and our services and our facilities to make sure that we can continue to provide the best trucks and the industry leading operating efficiencies that we're accustomed to. Our payout ratio has been in the range that you talked about, but obviously that's a matter that's reviewed and discussed with the board over time. And so we'll continue to monitor that and adjust our capital deployment strategies as we go forward.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and lastly, think you did nudge down your CapEx and R&D outlook for the year, can you just give us a sense for what's driving you, I guess, to the lower end of the previous range?","Robert J. Christensen","Yes, as we look at specific things that we're doing, and we continue to invest strongly in our products and our services. And so, as we look at where we're at and where we're going, just felt like we're probably going to be at the lower end of those prior ranges as we look forward, there's a lot of things that we're looking at, as we go forward to maintain a strong, steady flow of new products and services and keep improving our warehouse and plant operating efficiency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So just a quick question on the gross margin in the quarter, which is lower than it's been for a long time and the overall margins weren't all that bad obviously, but curious as to whether that was the pass through the European price increase or that was mix in the U.S. Maybe if you just give some color around it, maybe you didn't see this all that bad, and just wanted your take.","Ronald E. Armstrong","We feel good about how the teams performed around the world. In Europe, the Euro 6 product, as I mentioned, was a higher percentage of our deliveries in the first quarter, and with that comes a -- about a 15% average price increase for the price of a Euro 6 truck and we were able to recover that cost increase but the ability to make a margin on that increase was challenging just given the transition in the competitive environment that we were placed with in Europe.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, great. And then if you could just comment on, if you're willing, on the margin environment in U.S. Perhaps it was more big fleet deliveries than it will be for the rest of the year, I don't know if it's an abnormally fleet driven quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Margins are solid, our teams are doing well and we're competing very well in the marketplace. So we feel good about where we're at in North America with margin-wise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on an earlier question on Europe, I mean, the trends there do seem to be a little bit better-than-expected. Is there something that you're seeing that's preventing you from raising your market outlook for the European market this year or you're just trying to be conservative?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, we didn't feel like there was enough evidence at this point to raise our outlook because there's a mix of Euro 5 and Euro 6 trucks that are being registered and delivered to customers right now. And so we felt like we'll continue to monitor that as we always do. We'll be smarter in 90 days than we are today, and we'll modify our market estimates as we see fit based on how things develop. But we didn't feel like there's enough evidence, probably, change at this point.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. I guess, follow-up question on the MX 13, can you give us the penetration there on the Kenworth and Peterbilts, and just an update on where you are with the capacity?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, the MX is 35% to 40% of our build for Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy duty trucks. And we continue to support the production and have all the great shape from a capacity standpoint and lots of opportunity to continue to grow that penetration within our product line.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","The first question I have was a follow-up on Jerry's. He'd asked about the operating margins relative to a year ago. Ron, you mentioned you thought you could expand them 20 to 40 basis points, was that a sequential comment or a year-on-year comment?","Ronald E. Armstrong","That's a sequential comment.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as it relates to Europe, can you just bifurcate how you're thinking about kind of the U.K. versus of the continent in terms of end-market improvements in 2014?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, so the U.K. and the Netherlands had their -- they follow one set of Euro 5, Euro 6 transition rules. The other markets followed a different set and so you saw in the first quarter registrations, the U.K. the Netherlands were down and those were markets where DAF has a market leadership presence and on the continent, Germany, France, Spain, had increases again because they had different transition rules for Euro 6. So I think we'll see that the Europe -- or that the U.K. and the Netherlands will accelerate in terms of total market because U.K. economy is good and the Dutch economy is starting to show signs of improvement as well.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, then the last thing before I get back in queue, over the last couple of years, the first quarter has tended to be the most weighted on SG&A, is that progression you should look forward or repeat itself in 2014 or might there be any change in that normal pattern?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No, I think that's probably what you should think about it. The SG&A numbers will be comparable to a little bit down, maybe as you progressed through the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","First a clarification, when you said margin is up 20 to 40 bps, 1Q to 2Q, that was gross margins, not operating, correct?","Ronald E. Armstrong","That's gross margins, correct.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That were 2 different answers, so gross margins. On the production, the first and second quarter just hopping between a lot of calls today, my apologies, can you re -- say -- state again the production changes first quarter to second quarter, and then an answer to an earlier question, North America versus Europe? Can you just repeat that, please?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Our expectation is for overall production to be up 8% to 10% in the second quarter compared to first with slightly above average -- above that average in the U.S. and Canada and slightly below that average in Europe.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And we don't have the detail yet about the truck sales with the breakdown, some I'm going off of more kind of total geographic revenue, so I apologize, but does that seem to imply that we're going to be up in Europe again year-over-year in revenues in the 2Q?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Again remember that the Euro 6 vehicles, the average sales price for a Euro 6 truck is about 15% higher than a Euro 5 vehicle. So that's part of the equation.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe that's my question, sorry to interrupt, when you say production, I'm thinking unit production, you're speaking in revenues.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, production and deliveries are the same for us.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's a distinction, so it's the pricing, which is particularly help a sequential Europe. Are units going up sequentially 1Q to 2Q?","Ronald E. Armstrong","They are, yes. So when I talk about a the 8% to 10%, that is units.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so that was different than what you just said it. 8% to 10%, North America up more, Europe up a little less, is that as units or is it including the pricing from Euro 6, I apologize, to be clear.","Ronald E. Armstrong","That is units.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's interesting, so if units are up that much and then the pricing on top of it, as I assume that's even a lower heavier mix Euro 6 in the first quarter say you had some Euro 5 going out to start the quarter, the year-over-year growth in Europe sounds healthy in 2Q, North America strong, I do appreciate you not getting any margin on that Euro 6 price increase, but with that backdrop, the gross margin still seem to be a little more challenging you would have thought. So just trying to flesh out why the gross margin is going to be, let's just take the exact comment, 20 to 40 bps at only 12.3%, why would that not be up more? I'm just trying to be clear. Is there something about North America or, is it look we're just not getting any incremental margin on that Euro 6 pricing?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I mean, there's not an incremental margin on the Euro 6 pricing as we said here today. As we progress through the year, the market improves, it could be an opportunity.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So the last question related to that, do we expect the gross margin to be up year-over-year at all in this year, meaning third quarter or fourth quarter, without the second quarter is implied, it's down year-over-year again?","Robert J. Christensen","I think as we look for I think -- as we see here today, that the margin this year will be comparable over the prior year but that will depend on how the markets progress, how the pricing situation progresses, et cetera, so there's a lot of variables in that equation.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, so we get back to full year the same, we do need a little bit of growth somewhere year-over-year in the second half?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","A follow up to Seth's question on the MX engine, part segment pretax margins were up record level in the quarter, just wondering if you're starting to see benefits from the increased MX penetration rate that's occurred over the last few years, or is tailwind that still -- could still be to come?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think it's still to come. It's obviously the more engines we have in the part, the more opportunity we have for parts sales. But that's still developing, that part is up to 55,000 engines that we've put into Peterbilt and Kenworth vehicles. And so it's a great story but one that there's still a lot more upside as we progress.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Got it. And then sorry if I missed this but can you provide a breakdown of the new truck deliveries by geographic region in the quarter? I think you mentioned 31,800 for a total company, but just wondering if you can provide more granularity between Europe and North America?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure, so for U.S. and Canada, 18,600 units; Europe, 9,300 and rest of world, 3,900.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Actually, lot of my questions have been answered so I'll just follow-up on an earlier clarification. The gross margins that you mentioned, you're just not getting gross margin on the increase in Europe, but that doesn't explain the full amount, and it looks like gross margins are trailing down 50, 60, 70 basis points. Is there anything else in there that's kind of complicating that analysis?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No, I don't think so. Obviously, we're in the startup mode in Brazil but I think it's -- we feel good about where we're at and the margins are solid.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First of all, I guess I have kind of high-level philosophical question here, and I guess you kind of break it into 2 parts. Number one, do you think over the next 2, 3, 5 years there's going to be a higher percentage of fleet buyers as a result of our service and everything else pushing these smaller fleets and owner operators out of the market. That's part 1, and part 2 of the question is, if so, do you think that, that's going to drive, I guess, lower peaks and higher values or less kind of amplitude of the truck cycle as we go forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I mean, I guess, we've seen that trend with fewer owner operators, more fleet buyers in the market over the last 5, 6, 7 years, will it continue or is it to a point where it's about where it's going to be, I don't know but we're ready to be able to flex to whatever -- however, the market evolves. I think we've seen customers being very prudent in their purchasing habits over the last 2 or 3 years, as there's been uncertainty. Will that lead to less volatility? I don't know. But clearly, I think buyers of trucks have exercised restraint, if you will, as they lack the clarity of their ability to put trucks into operation and maintain those, and I think we're seeing improved confidence in that realm. And so, as backlogs get extended whether that changes, we'll see how that develops.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, and then I guess the last question here is shift on natural gas, I was wondering if you could give a quick update also if possible, what percentage of your production approximately right now is natural gas?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, we continue to be the leader in the natural gas business, but it continues to be very much a niche market. It's probably 1% to 2% of our production, is what we see and what the industry is seeing. And so as we look forward for the near future, it will continue to be a niche market, one that we're prepared to serve, but not a major element.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So I know there have been a lot of questions on the gross margin. I want to ask one on the operating margin. So if I kind of plug in what you guys are kind implying for revenue and gross margin, it's tough for me to see much operating margin or any operating margin improvement in the second quarter, and I know you saw good operating margin improvement in the first quarter. So just wondering, does that sound about right with the way you guys are thinking about it?","Robert J. Christensen","I don't have those numbers lined up in front of me but -- so I think as we look at our R&D spending range, or SG&A, so we feel second quarter we'll see numbers comparable to the first quarter in those areas. And so I think -- the operating margin probably, would be in terms of trend, similar to what the gross margin has trended from first to second quarter.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay, that makes sense. In terms of share, down maybe just a little bit year-over-year, I know it can be choppy, but how are you thinking about Class 8 share going forward the rest of the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Obviously Peterbilt and Kenworth have some great new products that they've launched in the last 6 to 18 months and those markets have -- gained great acceptance with our customers. As we continue to add additional features and elements that the market expects, then we'll continue to grow that. So Peterbilt and Kenworth are in great shape. Market share has been very consistent over the last 2 or 3 years and we think there's more upside as they continue to get more customers in these new trucks.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","And then just last one, if we go back historically after a new big product launch, where there a new technology or regulation, where the cost of the truck goes up a lot, how quickly do you, after that, is it 1 quarter or 2 quarters a year before you can start to make a little bit of a margin on that price increase?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I mean, it's really dependent on the market conditions. And so if there's a improvement in market demand, that opportunity can present itself. But if you recall in 2010, it's a big increase, and it takes a while to work through that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sara Majors from Wells Fargo Securities.","Sara Majors","I'm on for Andy Casey. Most of our questions have been asked and answered, but I wanted to explore the pricing pressure question a little bit more. I know you had said that pricing was up a bit but could you give us a little bit more color on how pricing trends are geographically either U.S. and Canada and then European market? And then how competitive are those in the market versus the recent past?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So I think we talked about Europe, that the pricing is up, consistent with the additional content that's added with Euro 6 and in North America. We're looking at small price realization enhancements as the market allows but it's a very competitive -- it's always competitive, I mean, that's the nature of our business and there's -- you always look to have the best value looking at the opportunity to provide your customers the best transportation solution and that includes operating costs, residual values, and we think we have a great solution for our customers.","Sara Majors","I mean, and in the U.S. and Canada, what's the competitive environment surrounding pricing right now?","Robert J. Christensen","It's always competitive. In all markets. It's what we do. And so we have great new products and great dealers and excited employees and we're pushing ahead and making inroads with new fleets that are appreciating the new Kenworth and Peterbilt models. And, but, for as long as I've been here, it's always competitive.","Operator","There are no questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Robin E.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has any objections, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode.","Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2016. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $4.2 billion, and third quarter net income was $346 million, a strong 8.1% after-tax return on revenues.","PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.7% driven by Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF's premium products, a robust European truck market, strong part sales and rigorous cost control. Kenworth and Peterbilt achieved record quarterly Class 8 market share of 31% in the U.S. and Canada. DAF increased year-to-date heavy-duty market share in Europe to 15.6%. PACCAR's increasing its investments and delivering new products and technologies, as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR axle, enhancements to PACCAR MX engines, and the DAF Connect Telematics System. I'm very proud of our 23,000 employees who've delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","This year marks the 20th anniversary of PACCAR's acquisition of DAF Trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF have achieved great synergies together. DAF has grown its market share from 9% to 15.6% in the last 20 years. DAF sells trucks, engines, and aftermarket parts in over 100 countries worldwide. DAF's expertise in powertrain development contributed to the production of PACCAR MX engines in North America and 47% MX engine penetration in Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks.","PACCAR delivered 34,900 trucks during the third quarter. Deliveries in Europe were 4% higher than last year's third quarter. The deliveries in the U.S. and Canada, reflecting a lower market, partially offset by strong share growth. We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 units to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand in a steady economy.","The eurozone's GDP growth for this year is 1.5%, with 2017 projected at a similar level. Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. And we expect the 2017 European heavy truck market to be another excellent year in a range of 260,000 units to 290,000 units. The U.S. economy is growing 1.5% this year as well. U.S. housing starts will grow 6% to 1.2 million units, and the automotive industry will deliver 17.2 million vehicles, comparable to last year's record sales.","Our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 215,000 units to 225,000 units. For 2017, economists are forecasting higher GDP growth of 2.2%, an increase in housing starts of 8%, and strong auto sales of 17.1 million units. Industrial production is expected to grow nearly 2% next year, which should be good news for the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will be in a range of 200,000 units to 230,000 units in 2017.","PACCAR global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 5% lower than the third quarter, due to more holidays and slightly lower build rates in North America. This is partially offset by higher build rates and more production days in Europe. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be 50 basis points to 100 basis points lower than the third quarter.","PACCAR Parts business generated quarterly revenues of $765 million. Parts quarterly pre-tax income was $338 million, with an excellent pre-tax return on revenue of 18.1%. These results were driven by the growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, an expanding network of TRP stores, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers.","PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pre-tax income was $71 million. Excellent portfolio performance contributed to the good results. During the quarter, PACCAR Financial enhanced its technology leadership with the introduction of a mobile sales and credit system, which allows customers and dealers to complete a loan application, receive an expedited credit decision, and electronically sign a contract on a mobile device.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and cash flows have enabled the company to invest over $6 billion in new products, technologies and facilities in the last 10 years. PACCAR estimates capital spending of $375 million to $400 million, and R&D expenses of $240 million to $250 million this year.","In 2017, we forecast increased capital investments of $375 million to $425 million, and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Was wondering if you could talk first about growth in the Parts segment. We've seen some good sequential increases here over the past two quarters, still comping down in year-over-year terms, though. So I was just wondering \u2013 I know that historically you'd spoken about dealer inventory issues in past quarters, maybe some other moving pieces there, but just wondering if you could give an update on what exactly is going on there and whether you're changing your forward-looking expectation so that segment can sustain, call it, low to mid single-digit growth?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No. I think as we look forward comparing the second half of this year to the first half of this year, we think that we'll see 2% to 4% growth during that period. And as we think about next year with the increasing number of PACCAR engines that are in the field and (8:35) with our customers, we've sold over 100,000 MX engines so far, I think we feel that next year's Parts revenue growth we'd continue to see somewhere in the 2% to 4% revenue growth range.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Very good. And then I had another question on raw material price fluctuation. Obviously, that's been a topic that folks are focusing on quite a bit recently, as well as the potential impact on gross margins. So, just wondering if you could provide an update, maybe a reminder on exactly how PACCAR deals with that contractually with suppliers, long-term supply agreements, and any impact you think that raw material fluctuations could have on margins maybe in this most recent quarter and then in coming quarters as well?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we have \u2013 75% to 80% of our purchases are under long-term agreements with our suppliers. Many of those have adjustment clauses that spread the effects of material cost movements over time. And I would say that the effect today has been pretty nominal.","Alexander Eugene Potter - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein with Citi.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Tim.","Operator","Mr. Thein, your line is open. If you are on mute, please unmute your line. Hello, Mr. Thein, if you are on mute, please unmute your line and proceed with your question.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think we should move on.","Operator","Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. Thanks. This is Cliff Richard (10:32) on for Steve.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Cliff (10:35).","Unknown Speaker","I had a question \u2013 good morning. Thanks for the color, guys. On the special dividend, how do you determine whether it'll be flat year-over-year? Just thinking about the market for next year and just wondering what your planning process is for that.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we have a discussion with the board during the course of the fourth quarter and the board will evaluate a lot of factors and that decision will be made in our upcoming board meeting. So, if you look at the payout ratio over time it's typically been in the 40% to 50% of net income.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you. And then just on used pricing, how did used prices trend during the quarter? Are you seeing any changes in that market?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think the used prices both in North America and Europe during the third quarter were relatively stable, so not much movement during the quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, this wasn't in the press release and I know it's still a really small part of your business. But, Ron, I'm curious about your outlook for the Brazil truck market in 2017.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","This year, we think, hopefully will be the bottom of this cycle and we expect to see some positive movement. I think the country is taking some really positive moves with some of the fiscal actions. So, we're optimistic that the market will improve. But more importantly, we're very optimistic about the DAF product, its position in the market, the DAF dealers who represent DAF, and our ability to grow our share as we move forward. So, somewhere 40,000 trucks, probably plus or minus compared to 30,000 trucks to 32,000 trucks this year.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Ron. That's helpful. And then just shifting to U.S. and Canada dealer inventory. I know last quarter you said that you're pretty comfortable with your inventories in the channel. Is that still the case? And then, what's your view on industry inventory levels?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I'm very comfortable with our situation. We have less than 60 days worth of inventory. In North America, with great shape in Europe, so inventories are in great shape. I think the numbers I see, the industry inventories have moved down and so that should be good for future orders.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good afternoon, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How are things?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Great.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Can we take a look at your forecast for 2017 for U.S. and Canada? It's a bit more optimistic than ours or some of the industry pundits. And last year this time, you were a lot more optimistic about U.S. and Canada for 2016. Can you just talk a little bit about where your forecast might have been wrong for 2016 and where you think the risks might be for 2017? I mean, there could be upside or downside frankly, but what you're seeing out there and what gives you confidence in 2017 forecast?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, if you recall, we get smarter every quarter. And as we've progressed, we adjusted our U.S. and Canada markets downward and Europe upward. So, things happened in the economy around the world in the year (14:32). So, sometimes you are on the right side, sometimes you are on the other side. For next year, based on economic growth expectations of 2% or so plus some industrial production improvement, continued strength in housing and automotive, we feel comfortable with the range of 200,000 units to 230,000 units for next year, and we'll see how that progresses. Again, we'll be smarter every quarter.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, but were there any pockets of surprise in 2016 where you thought there might be a better market than it turned out, so I'm just trying to get some idea of where the weakness might exactly have shown up?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think it was more of \u2013 again, it's more of a macro view than a micro view.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you kind of size the UK market for us, for you versus Eastern Europe, and if the UK continues to be under pressure on Brexit actions or fears versus the Eastern Europe maybe continuing to be strong into next year? I mean, if you put all of Eastern Europe together, which is a bigger market for PACCAR, for DAF?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, that's \u2013 so the UK is typically 10,000 trucks to 11,000 trucks per year, which is a really good market for DAF and post-Brexit, the demand for trucks and parts is still present. Obviously, the pound movement has had some slight impact on margins, but the pound goes up and down and the prices are just over time. So, whatever impact there is, is temporary.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the size of the Eastern European market for DAF?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I don't have those numbers, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe we can circle back. I'm just trying to figure out the net impact of maybe one being weaker and one being stronger. So, I'll get back in line and we can talk about it offline.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Okay.","Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","I'm trying to think a little bit about your MX engine penetration. I think when we first started on this path, it was like a 50% penetration goal and, I guess, we've achieved that and I assume that's going to go higher going forward. I'm wondering if you have just a view of what 2017 might look like. But more than that, I'm trying to think about the utilization at that plant in the U.S. and I'm wondering \u2013 I'm assuming that as we get more penetration and more units of MX engine that should be a margin tailwind for the company, but I'm curious if you just might flesh that out for me?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, as we do with all of our factories, we invest for the expected capacity in the mid-term, I guess you could say. And as we look long term, we'll continue to make investments to support our expectations, and so we expect the penetration of that to continue to climb gradually over time as more and more customers get the MX in their fleet and transition to more and more MX mix. So I think we're well-positioned supporting the current market, and we'll continue to invest with new machinery to support the ongoing needs of \u2013 really our global needs around the world.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","So is part of your CapEx increase because you need some more capacity at that plant?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","We have some ongoing currently, yes. So we have a little bit of impact in 2016 and some ongoing investment in 2017.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Two questions, I guess. One, given that we're sort of at the end of October, can you talk to sort of what you're hearing from the big fleets and sort of how they're thinking about 2017, regardless of your retail sales forecasts or what you're hearing from the small and medium-sized fleets? And then, I guess the second question on 2017, assuming that your retail sales forecasts are correct for both the U.S. and Europe, I don't think you talked about this in the prepared remarks. Can you talk about where you think gross margins can be, whether they'd be flat, down or up, just with some of the market dynamics that are taking place? Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, our discussions with our customers have really focused on, one, the great performance of our products in the market. Discussions have typically centered on, I guess I would say a comparable level of investment next year to what they've done this year, sort of small, medium, large, et cetera. I think a lot of that will obviously be dictated by how the economy develops. In terms of gross margins, thinking about next year, obviously, there's a lot of things that will impact that over time. Right now I would say, our next year margins would be comparable to what we'll see in the fourth quarter this year, plus or minus 0.5% up or down.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm sorry. What did you say the fourth quarter margin was?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, I said it'd be down about 50 basis points to 100 basis points from the third quarter levels.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. I'll get back in queue.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning. Thanks, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. I mean, PACCAR was very early at cutting production in late 2015 and your \u2013 it sounds like, got into a slightly weaker Q4. Are you taking production down another notch in the U.S. right now? And would you suspect that, when you do that, you'll be able to produce in line with retail for 2017, which you're basically guiding flat to down 2% or so?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, our approach has always been, for a lot of years, has always been to build based on demand of our customers and our dealers, and our actions with respect to production reflect that. The great news is that in the third quarter, we achieved a record market share for Peterbilt and Kenworth combined in U.S. and Canada of 31%. So, great recognition of the great products that they're producing at their factories currently, and we'll continue to build based on what that market demand looks like. So, inventories are in great shape, and so I would think that retail would be closely tied to production levels as we move forward.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you. And just on Parts, with respect to this 18% margin that you've held, I think, for seven over the last eight quarters, or somewhere close to that. Do you feel like it's sustainable going forward? Because certainly you've been operating and performing at a level higher than you were two to three years ago.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure. And the team has done a great job with leveraging the operating infrastructure that we have in the Parts business. We've obviously added \u2013 enhanced our Parts distribution capabilities in the Northwestern part of the U.S. with the Renton facility. We'll be adding some additional facilities in the coming future, all balanced to meet the market demand and ensure that our customers are getting the best support in the industry with keeping their trucks operating and on the road. So I think we'll continue to see that level of performance.","Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon and morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good afternoon and morning to you.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. It's afternoon here. Anyways, I'm wondering if I could pull some of the information that you usually put in the 10-Q a little bit forward. Could you comment on average selling prices in the truck segment, and was that negative again in this quarter? It had been for the first two quarters.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think slightly. I think, yeah, slightly negative. Typically, the average sales price of a truck in Europe is a little lower than the average sales price in North America, so mix has some impact on that.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, Ron. And then, if I look at the fincorp (24:03) and I'm splitting hairs a little bit, we have seen some really modest increases in the provisions for losses on receivables. I mean, it's clearly not close to the levels of, call it, eight years ago or so. But what region is driving that modest increase or is it just kind of spread all over the place?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","As you said, it's very modest. The portfolio is performing \u2013 actually that credit loss level is at historically low levels and few customers in the oil and gas business, but that's the focus of it.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a clarification. I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about sequential parts into the fourth quarter. What was that comment?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I didn't really comment on that, but I think the fourth quarter, we're looking at comparables revenue levels I think in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Thein with Citi.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, Ron. Can you hear me now?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. We can hear you, Tim.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Yeah, yeah. Sorry about (25:21) earlier.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No problem.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just going back into the U.S. and Canada, obviously, just given Peterbilt's position, the vocational market, pretty well represented there. It looks as though your overall retail outlook a little bit more positive than some. But I'm just curious, as we hear from some of the big truckload companies here in the past day or two, looks like they're pulling back on spending a bit more. So I'm just curious if you could maybe slice your comments on U.S. and Canada more finely between trucks versus tractors for 2017 in terms of your expectations for the broader market?","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. Tim, it's Bob. I think we see a fairly comparable level of buy from both the vocational and the over-the-road customers in 2017 from 2016. Both Kenworth and Peterbilt have strong vocational presence. I think combined the company is 35% to 40% market share in the vocational business, which has been very, very good for us over the last couple of years. But increasingly, the new Peterbilts and the new Kenworths are getting even more traction in some of the larger fleets, and so we're getting incremental kind of conquest purchases from customers. But on balance, we think that 2017 is going to look very, very comparable to 2016.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then just coming back to the question earlier on used values. Can you comment on what \u2013 I mean, the MX has been out there long enough and just given normal trade cycles, presumably, you've got a little bit more volume to make a call on \u2013 or to have a little bit more visibility on it. Can you just give us some color in terms of how the trucks with the MX have been performing in the secondary markets?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, we're starting to get those \u2013 those first trucks are that we built in 2010, 2011 are now passing onto the second owner and I think what we'll see as time goes on is the durability with the CGI steel that we use to build the head and block and just the rigorous testing that we put the engines through that that will be reflected in the used prices over time as we move forward. So we're very optimistic about how that will progress.","Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, guys. How's it going?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good. And you?","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. If you keep getting smarter every quarter, by 2019 you will be able to give us a single point earnings forecast.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","(28:27) Joel.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I wondered in the Parts decline, if you can give us any color in the quarter, if it was more on the volume side or any pricing weakness or mix?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, it's primarily \u2013 it's all volume related, nothing of \u2013 (28:40) sort of the volume of shipments, yeah.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then since some many questions are about sort of doubting your flat forecast for 2017, I just wonder if you can give us a couple of things that we should incorporate into our thinking around levers you can pull to show earnings resiliency in 2017, if things are a little worse than flat.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. As we commented, we continue to make prudent investments in operating efficiency both in our factories, the warehouses, we continue to use more and more technology in our business processes, in our factories, and continuing to provide new technology to our customers. So we'll just continue to make those investments. And if you look back at the history, we've got a history of delivering 5% to 7% efficiency gains over the long term and we'll continue to make those kinds of investments as we move into 2017.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Good morning.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good morning.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I just want to ask a bigger picture question. With the launch of the proprietary axle, should we think about that as the start of \u2013 well, not the start, but kind of the next step in increased vertical integration? And can you talk about what your take rate expectations are for that product starting next year? Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we have a nice balance of vertical integration with some of our components and great relationships with our suppliers in other areas, and I think we'll continue with that balanced approach for this particular axle. If you look out probably a year or two down the road, this axle will probably be 30%, 40%, 50% of the axles that we put on our North American vehicles. And, of course, the axles we put on DAF products are 100% PACCAR axles. So, we have a combination of vertical and supplier provided, but more and more \u2013 much more of the supplier provided components are proprietary in that they're developed to work in a very efficient manner with the rest of our powertrain component. So you'll continue to see that trend as we move forward going with all of our suppliers.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And just from kind of an initial ramp perspective, should we think about it as kind of margin neutral in 2017 and takes a little while to hit critical mass or should that be accretive from the get-go?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","No, I don't think it'll be a big factor in terms of margin performance.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. A quick follow-up to Andy's question. Within the Financial Services segment, the increase in the interest and other expense in the quarter, what can that be attributed to? It sounds like used truck prices maybe not so much, anything else you can point to there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, a factor is that used truck pricing and reflecting that as adjustments to depreciation expense over time, so as we have trucks return off-lease (32:25) et cetera, that typically runs through the depreciation expense line. So, that's one element of it. And then the rest of it is just the competitiveness of the market and the spread of interest earned and interest paid. So, that's the two elements of it.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, how are your inventory levels positioned at your used truck centers in North America, just curious if inventory levels are normal or higher than historical levels?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I would say normal. And we're continuing to invest in our ability to support our used truck operations, as time is going on, we deal with a lot more larger fleets, we're more heavily engaged in taking trade-ins with our customers and are working with our dealers and so we'll continue to invest. We're probably going to open by the end of the year a new facility in the Chicago area and adding some additional capacity at our facility in Salt Lake City. So it's, I'd say, normal at a higher level just given the level of activity that we're seeing with trade-ins and operating lease activity.","Neil A. Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Great. Thanks for the time.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, good afternoon. The 5% sequential decline 3Q to 4Q, can you help us with that a little bit sequentially when it comes to Europe versus other versus U.S., Canada?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure. So it's lower operating leverage from a lower production level for the quarter, a slight reduction in price realization in U.S. and Canada because of the competitive market conditions, and a small impact from the movement of the pound versus the euro. The pound is \u2013 well, it's down, it's certainly within a range that we've seen in the last near-term history. And so, as time goes on, we'll work through that, and prices will adjust to a more normalized margin level going forward.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And just so I'm clear that down 5%, that's a production number? Can I equate that to a unit number as well? I am just trying to work off of down 5% sequentially should be a little over 33,000 units from what you...?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","That's correct.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","So, within that, is that sort of a Europe up 10%, North America \u2013 U.S. Canada down high teens, with Other doing their sequential normal uptick?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I don't have the specific numbers, Dave, but definitely Europe will be up because of increased workdays and we have the summer shutdowns, so we have more workdays in the fourth quarter, plus a slightly higher build rate, and that will be offset by U.S. and Canada.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","And Other usually \u2013 having its usual fourth quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, I think it'll be pretty comparable to the third quarter levels.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then on the U.S. Canada outlook for 2017, I know it's an industry forecast, not yours. But when I think of the cadence through the year, when we think about retail sales have been running of late still down 20%, orders have been down, up 25%, 30%, the comps do ease, especially for the orders in the spring. Can you take us through your thought process on the down 2%? Is it a industry order rate starting to turn positive by late spring, and it's sort of a unit sales kind of down, call it, high single-digit in the first half, up high single-digit in the second half, a little bit more than that? Just trying to think, how back-half loaded is it, but appreciating that the orders at some point you hope turn positive, given the comps get easier, let's call it, April\/May?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. I think all of the OEMs have been building trucks out of the backlog throughout this year, and so I think you will see the convergence of order levels, retail sales, production, et cetera, at a \u2013 whatever the run rate will be. And I think our feeling is that, as we get past the first of the year, we'll see some progression, given the economic assumptions about continued GDP growth, strong housing and automotive, and some return to industrial production growth.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Yeah. I'm not trying to pin you to a month, but should I take that to mean yes? I mean, it's just mathematically, the orders have to turn positive at some point in 2017 to turn around the retail sales, to be up to down slightly (37:05) for the year. Okay.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely.","David Raso - Evercore ISI","Helpful. Okay. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities","Good morning, guys.","Ronald E.

I know it's small for you, but would love to hear your color on how that's going, and how it might turn out next year?","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, it will be a comparable level to this year, probably somewhere in the 80,000 unit range.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities","Okay. Great. If you can also give us kind of your thoughts on how share is going on that region, in that size range, both this year, and you have goals to grow that share next year in Class 5 through Class 7?","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah, absolutely. If you look at PACCAR's performance over several years in the medium-duty segment, we grow share in North America 0.5 point per year, and we would continue to expect that would be the case in 2017 as well.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. If you look at, 2015 was a record year for medium-duty truck deliveries for PACCAR and we're going to be pretty close to that 2015 level for 2016. And so we're optimistic that we've got the products and the supporting network to make that growth continue.","Michael David Shlisky - Seaport Global Securities","Fair enough, guys. Thanks so much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. I just wanted to ask you, on your European outlook of being down a little bit. I think some others saying it's going to be flat, maybe up a little bit. And just wanted to get some additional detail on what exactly is concerning you, is it the Brexit or certain other things?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I think, at 260,000 trucks to 290,000 trucks, that is an excellent truck market. We've probably taken a little bit of a conservative approach on the heels of 2016 being at 295,000 trucks, which is the best truck market since 2008. So we hope that it would continue at the current pace, but we've been a bit conservative in terms of our projection for our outlook for next year.","Mike J. Baudendistel - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. First question, just on market share in U.S. and Canada, you noted the 31% in the quarter. I think earlier in the year, talked a little bit about larger share capture in order activity. So, it seems like over the past few years, market share has been pretty stable. Do you see some momentum building as you're looking into 2017? Do you think that that step's a little bit higher?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. If you look at the history, when I started with the company, we were a 21% player and we sort of went up to a new plateau at 25% and now we're at 28%, 29%. Peterbilt, Kenworth continue to introduce additional configurations around their 2.1 meter platform. Peterbilt just launched their Model 520 for the low-cab forward market. We just introduced enhanced axle and engine components that will enhance the performance of the vehicle. So, we continue to increment the product lineup and we'll continue to do that, as we have done for 20 years, and we think that will lead to continued share growth over the long term.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","A relatively steady market share history over the last couple of years needs to be placed into context of an oil and gas business that hasn't been generating any truck sales and we typically have been fairly strong in that segment, so we're offsetting that loss with some of the new wins that Ron talked about.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's a helpful point. Thank you. And then just a clarification on the proprietary axle. I think, Ron, it sounded like from your comments, you were talking about some kind of supplier partnerships, and it sounds like this is that case. This isn't taking something from DAF and bringing it over. This is something that was co-developed and will be manufactured in North America and then supplied to you. Is that how everything works (41:51)?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","That's exactly right.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And so in terms of the opportunity for you, you talked about certainly a margin impact, it sounds like it drives more traffic into your dealers and then there's the obvious benefit of that?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Yeah. There's definitely a competitive advantage that comes with this proprietary axle and the integration of it with the rest of the elements of the powertrain, so.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Lighter weight axle and better fuel economy, yeah.","Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","So, I had a question, with the share gains that you guys are seeing, are you seeing any noticeable shift of larger fleets versus owner-operators? And is that something that we should be thinking about that has an impact on gross margins going forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think we've been active in all elements of the market for many years, and we are conquesting new customers all the time, but our product is very competitive with the fleets. And the excellent operating efficiency of our vehicle, the higher residual value, there's a lot of elements that make our products very attractive not only to large fleets, but small and medium-sized customers as well. So, a great product lineup, great performance, continue to demand 10% to 15% difference in terms of residual value versus the competitive product.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","But are you seeing a mix shift within your split between the two?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think we've seen that over the last five, six, seven years, more and more of our volume is with medium and larger fleets.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","That mix gives us the opportunity to get more looks at the Parts business than we would maybe with owner-operator customers, that also gives us more looks on the Financial Services business. So that mix shift is a positive thing for us as well.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Sure.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Got you. Okay.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","When you say the \u2013 the margin performance over the last five, six years, as we've transitioned, it's been excellent.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Can you just comment \u2013 so your view on gross margin kind of holding steady from the fourth quarter level next year, what are you assuming for your Class 8 share and the percent of the engines that you're doing on your own?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, we typically will assume a share and penetration comparable to the current levels and we'll continue to put in actions to enhance both of those as we progress throughout the year.","Robert J. Christensen - PACCAR, Inc.","Engine share will be comparable to slightly positive compared to this year probably in that 50% range.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, great. And then just last thing quickly, so nice kind of reduction in SG&A this quarter from second quarter. Is that a good run rate going forward or is there a little bit more that you guys can take out there?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","I think if you average \u2013 take the average spending for the year, I think that's pretty indicative of our level of SG&A spending.","Scott H.

So, over the last decade, your market share is up almost 1,000 basis points. You guys have always been known as sort of this premium product with a low total ownership cost. You've made significant inroads into the fleet market. Do you at any point think that your competition kind of gets it and they are trying to mimic that business model at some point or that product proposition at some point? And then the second question is, how do you think about competing against maybe that potential change in strategy?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Well, I can't speak for our competition. I know what our focus is and you laid it out pretty well. It's a focus on providing the highest quality products, low operating cost, premium value for our customers, excellent support with aftermarket parts and Financial Services, and that continues to be our focus for the near, mid and long term, and we'll continue to make investments to build on that, and we'll compete toe-to-toe with our competitors, whatever their approach may be.","Kwame Webb - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","And then just the follow-up here. So, clearly your scales increased, you launched the MX engine four years ago, axles today. I mean, should we start to think about increased vertical integration becoming a much larger part of the story going forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","As I mentioned earlier, it's a balance of vertical integration and supplier provided proprietary components. And so, I think that's the approach that we'll continue to apply as we move forward, and you'll see more \u2013 as time goes on, you'll see more branded PACCAR components because they are unique to integrate with our vehicle and our powertrain.","Kwame Webb - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)","Great. Thank you.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Barry Haimes with Sage Asset Management.","Barry George Haimes - Sage Asset Management LP","Thanks very much. I've two questions. First one real quick, since Brexit, have you had to put in a price increase to offset the FX headwind? And if so, how much might that have been? And the second question is kind of following on David Raso's question about orders in 2017 and when they might inflect. Can they start to inflect upwards given where used truck prices are now? Given that \u2013 it seems that people are \u2013 or at least a lot of customers are upside down on trades? Or do we need a certain amount of price increase in used to kind of get you to that better audit result? And if so, maybe by how much would used have to come up to kind of put people back in bounce? Thanks so much.","Ronald E. Armstrong - PACCAR, Inc.","So, as I mentioned before, the pound moves up and down over time and pricing adjust to reflect that all the OEMs predominantly have their production on the continent, we're very fortunate in that we're the only UK truck maker. So we have a bit of a natural hedge with respect to UK cost and prices. So we'll adjust pricing as the market needs to adjust to earn a fair return on our trucks over time. With respect to used truck pricing, I think, as we progress through next year, customers are keeping their trucks perhaps a little bit longer. At some point, though, the value intersects with the current market, and they'll be back in the market at some point to reinvest in new equipment. The new equipment has such attractive operating efficiencies with lower fuel consumption, better operating efficiency, the reliability and durability of the products are outstanding, so you have to upgrade at some point to take advantage of those features that are on the newer products.","Barry George Haimes - Sage Asset Management LP","Great.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions, that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR achieved excellent revenues and earnings for the third quarter of 2017. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.1 billion, and third quarter net income was $403 million, a strong 8% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.5%, driven by growing Kenworth and Peterbilt market share in North America, a robust European truck market and record aftermarket parts results. Kenworth and Peterbilt's year-to-date Class 8 market share in the U.S. and Canada was 30.1%, more than 2 percentage points higher than in the same period last year. DAF is currently producing trucks at record build rates in its Eindhoven factory. I'm very proud of our 25,000 employees who have delivered the world's highest quality trucks, parts and financial services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR delivered 40,200 trucks during the third quarter, 2% higher than the second quarter. Increased build rates in North America, Australia and Brazil were partially offset by fewer build days in Europe due to the regular summer shutdown. Next quarter, we're expecting 7% to 9% higher deliveries compared to the third quarter due to increased production in Europe. Deliveries will be slightly lower in North America due to regularly scheduled holidays. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the fourth quarter are forecast to be down slightly from the third quarter due to a higher mix of truck sales compared to parts.","The U.S. economy is expanding 2% to 2.5% this year. We expect U.S. housing starts will grow to 1.2 million units, and the automotive industry will deliver nearly 17 million vehicles. We've raised our estimate of retail sales for this year's U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market to a range of 210,000 to 220,000 units. For 2018, economists are forecasting continued GDP growth of 2% to 3%, an increase in housing starts of 7% and another strong year of auto sales. Industrial production is also expected to expand 2% to 3% next year. We head toward 2018 with positive momentum in the U.S. economy and the truck industry. We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales will increase to a range of 220,000 to 250,000 units in 2018.","We've raised our 2017 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 300,000 to 310,000 units, reflecting continued strong demand and a growing economy. The eurozone's GDP growth expectation for this year is 2.1%, with 2018 projected at a similar level. Freight transport activity on German highways is at record levels, up 4% this year. We expect that 2018 European heavy truck market to have another excellent year in a range of 280,000 to 310,000 units.","PACCAR's Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $840 million. Parts quarterly pretax income was a record $153 million, with an excellent pretax return on revenue of 18.2%. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and increased sales of TRP All Makes parts drove these results. We're pleased to have opened the 100th TRP store during the quarter. TRP stores expand PACCAR's aftermarket opportunity by selling more parts to the second and third owners of All Makes of trucks.","PACCAR Financial Services third quarter pretax income increased 13% to $71 million compared to $63 million in the second quarter this year. The portfolio, which was a record $13.1 billion this quarter, continued to perform very well. U.S. Class 8 industry used truck sales volumes increased during the quarter. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values continue to command a 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles.","PACCAR is increasing its investments in delivering new products and technologies as reflected in the recent introduction of the new PACCAR automated transmission, the new DAF XF and CF vocational trucks and new DAF LF vehicles. We estimate capital spending of $400 million to $450 million and R&D expenses of $260 million to $270 million this year.","In 2018, we're planning for increased capital investments of $425 million to $475 million and increased R&D expenses of $270 million to $300 million. These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.","To expand our technology and industry leadership, PACCAR is investing in technologies that may take several years to commercialize. A current example of our advanced driver assistance systems investments is a truck platooning trial that begins early next year in the U.K.","PACCAR is also a leader in alternative powertrains. Kenworth and Peterbilt are market leaders in the North American natural gas truck segment, and we're currently testing electric powertrains in PACCAR trucks as well. While we think it will be some time before electric trucks become a sizable segment of annual industry sales, there could be an opportunity in certain applications in the medium term. PACCAR knows from experience that customers adopt technology when it provides a financial return for their businesses or is mandated by government regulations. Our focus is to always offer transportation solutions with industry-leading technologies that maximize our customers' operating efficiency.","Thank you. I'd be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about the expanded product lineup that you folks are delivering in Europe. How should we think about the production learning curve for you folks? Any productivity changes that we should be thinking about? And the overall margin profile of the product line as you ramp it through the factories, anything we should keep in mind for the sequential margin outlook?","Ronald Armstrong","No. The transition of production to the new CF, XF and soon the LF vehicles, that's all gone very well. So production ramp-up has gone without any challenges. And so we're moving into the next phase with the vocational trucks and getting ready to transition with the new LFs. So all that has gone very well. Yes, Harrie has some thoughts here. Just a second.","Harrie Schippers","The production started already in June. And like Ron said, the ramp-up had been pretty smooth. The trucks offer 7% better fuel economy and lots of other benefits for our customers and have been extremely well received.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And normally, when you folks do a new product rollout, there's typically a higher level of automation. And is that the case here as well from a manhours-per-unit standpoint that we should keep in mind?","Ronald Armstrong","I think one of the great things that is just coming online is not necessarily tied to the launch of the new products, is the Westerlo cab paint shop, which does have the latest state-of-the-art paint robotic applications in the industry. So it's a fantastic plant. If you ever get a chance to go to Europe and visit DAF's facilities, that would be certainly be a stop because it does have state-of-the-art robotics and the quality and the finish of the products is great.","Jerry Revich","And Ron, at the end of your prepared remarks, you mentioned electric truck is coming into focus for select applications. Can you talk about how we should be thinking about the margin profile for you folks on electric trucks versus diesel-powered trucks? Anything we should keep in mind? And then from a parts standpoint, I guess there's concern about wider maintenance intervals. And I'm wondering how are you folks thinking about possible offsets. And appreciating that it's a small market subset where that product would make sense, but just conceptually, if you could touch on that.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, Jerry. As I mentioned, I think that the commercialization of that is several years away, probably outside a reasonable planning window for any significant adoption. Battery packs are still very large, they're heavy, they're expensive. And so there's really -- while we need to be ready for that technology, the commercial viability of that has some ways to go. So I don't think that's going to be something that we're going to be factoring into thoughts about margins, et cetera, in the near term. I think it's a midterm technology that we'll see. And first, it will be in vehicles -- the smaller vehicles and vehicles that aren't in the mainstream like, say, port applications or refuse trucks, something like that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","I guess a couple of questions. You noted -- obviously, PACCAR historically has been -- is a company to sort of invest in technology for your customers. And you gave your R&D and CapEx outlook for '18. But given some of the changes in the truck industry, whether it's EV or platooning, autonomous, I mean, is that a potential headwind to margins, sort of like we shouldn't think about you guys being able -- in the near term or at least in the next 12 to 24 months delivering sort of what we would view as a normalized incremental margin? And then if you could talk to what that normalized incremental margin would be. And then I guess my second question is on just what you're seeing -- I think there's some concern going into '18 on whether or not the big fleets do come in and actually start to order. So can you just talk about, when you think about '18, will the customer base be big fleets? Will it be more broad-based, vocational, small guys, big guys? Just sort of what you're hearing from the customers in the U.S.?","Ronald Armstrong","Okay. Let's talk about technology. Obviously, we've just opened our office in Silicon Valley. And so we have a lot of relationships before we opened the office, and we'll continue to build relationships for future technologies in the areas of connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, including autonomous, electrification. All those things are things that we're involved with currently and will continue to be involved with. I don't see that will impact -- we are projecting that our R&D spend will go up somewhat next year, but in terms of gross margins, I don't see that being a factor in the near term at all.","With respect to customers, the feedback from discussions with customers is, I think, pretty optimistic about their prospects, what they're seeing in terms of demand and, more recently, some favorable freight pricing. So what we're hearing from customers is generally positive, at least orders as high as last year. I think it will continue to be dominated by the on-highway fleet guys, but vocational is very good. There's lots of construction in certain parts of the country. And if there is an infrastructure plan that gets implemented, that will bode well for the demand for vocational trucks as we start next year as well.","Jamie Cook","Okay. So just to be clear though, the investment will not impact -- we should think about normalized incremental margins for PACCAR going forward?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","Just a couple of questions. First, just on the finco and how it relates to used truck prices. I mean, used pricing seems to be firming a little bit. Do you think that translates into higher new equipment pricing anytime soon? I mean, there seems to be a lot of competition on new products out there. Or do we just sort of meander around this flattish pricing environment for new trucks for a while?","Ronald Armstrong","What we've seen is relatively steady pricing. And at this market level, I think that's what we're anticipating from a pricing standpoint. You're correct about the used truck market there. Prices are firming. And I think most of our guys and the folks we talk with feel like that used truck prices have bottomed and are stabilizing and have some upside. On the used truck side, we're starting now to see more of our newer model trucks being returned off lease, so that's a positive sign that we'll see over the next 12 to 18 months.","Ross Gilardi","Got it. And then just on Parts, I mean, your longer-term growth rate, I think you would agree, is closer to kind of mid-single digits, maybe 6%. And you've clearly been running well ahead of that this year. Do you think you see a slowdown in 2018? Or does it feel like this above-trend growth in Parts will continue for at least a couple more quarters?","Ronald Armstrong","For now, we're thinking that next year is somewhere in the 3% to 5% range for Parts revenue growth for next year, but we'll see how it develops. Obviously, the demand is there. We're continuing to add dealer location. Our team has got great programs and really making it easier all the time for our dealers and customers to do business with PACCAR Parts. We're adding distribution capability. We're just starting the construction of a new facility in Toronto, and we'll continue to increment our distribution capability in the coming months and years. So we feel good about the prospects. And right now, 3% to 5% is our thinking about next year globally.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","Just can we go back to pricing for a second? I mean, I'm curious because, historically, once we get above sort of mid-cycle in the U.S., we start to think about maybe having a little bit of opportunity to get a little price. And I guess I'm just not sure with all the new products and the competition and so forth. Do we still think that's potentially possible? Or is that not so much on the table?","Ronald Armstrong","I think as we sit here today, I mean, it's a great product to offer, but we have competitors in the market. And so we're going to be able to earn what the customer is willing to pay. And so at this point, pricing feels like it's a pretty steady proposition in both Europe and North America.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, good. And then I think you mentioned gross margin's down slightly in the fourth quarter. Historically, if you look back, the SG&A sort of kicks up a little bit in the fourth quarter. I guess there's some year-end true-up things or not. Should we expect that this year as well? Is there any trend there to call out just as we think about the fourth quarter?","Ronald Armstrong","I think we're pretty sort of focused on the dollars. And so I would think the dollars will be pretty comparable to third quarter levels. So I don't see any significant increase in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Can you talk a little bit about 2018, your guidance? Can you just break out maybe the segments, the sleeper segment versus the Class 8 straight versus day cabs? Anything different by any segment that you're anticipating for 2018 versus '17?","Ronald Armstrong","No, I'd say segment-wise, I think we anticipate similar mix of our sales to what we've seen in 2017, which is in Europe, DAF continues to be a industry leader in the tractor segment, continues to focus on growing their vocational volumes. And the new trucks that they've just launched will enhance their capability in that arena. And in North America, I think we anticipate that the growth in the market will come in really all segments, both the on-highway as well as some vocational. So I don't see any particular segment mix or customer mix sort of affecting our sales next year.","Ann Duignan","Okay. I appreciate the color. That's helpful. And then you forecast U.S., Canada. Any difference U.S. versus Canada? And then do you have an outlook for Mexico so we can kind of square back to NAFTA?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So I think if you look at this year, U.S. is probably flat to maybe a little bit down year-over-year, but Canada has bounced back. The Canadian market this year is stronger than it was in 2016. I think next year, I think, we expect the U.S. will be the area where a lot of the growth will occur for U.S. and Canada. And Mexico, it should be another good year in Mexico, expect the market to be comparable. Election years in Mexico sometimes have a little bit of an uptick because of some of the stimulus that gets added to the economy. So that could be a potential upside for Mexico next year.","Ann Duignan","Unless NAFTA is cancelled, I presume?","Ronald Armstrong","Excuse me?","Ann Duignan","Unless NAFTA is cancelled?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. Yes, I don't have any perspective on that, and I don't think that makes any sense, but...","Ann Duignan","Agreed. And then just on your -- the same kind of mix discussion, U.K. registration is down significantly this past month. Any change in mix there? Any perceived market share loss for DAF? Just U.K. slows, it's a decent market for DAF. If you could comment on that for 2018, that would be great.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. Harrie's got some thoughts on that.","Harrie Schippers","So Ann, if we look at the U.K. market for us, registrations year-to-date are exactly the same as they were last year. Market share is up 0.1%. We're above 30% market share, still continue to be market leaders in the U.K. And also orders year-to-date are at the same level as they were last year. So we haven't seen that softening in the U.K. that some people talked about.","Ann Duignan","So orders flat year-to-date despite just last month's anomaly, then registration is down 20%?","Harrie Schippers","Yes, it is flat. In the month of September, it was a little bit lower, but year-to-date, it's at the same level as it was last year. So September is always a big month with new license plates, so we got some fluctuations in that month typically. But year-to-date, we're at the same level.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","I guess a similar question to what Ann just asked. I'm trying to back into your 7% to 9% delivery growth sequentially 4Q versus 3Q. And it seems to imply a pretty strong ramp -- well, it does imply a strong ramp in Europe. I mean, are there market share gains that are embedded in that number for the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? I'm just trying to figure out how to get to that 7% to 9% growth sequentially.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, Seth. The big thing is that DAF has a 2-week shutdown during the third quarter, and plus they're building on basically a single shift during a couple weeks before and after that shutdown period. And they're building about 1,000 trucks a week, so that really is the big, big element. And DAF has increased their production somewhat for the fourth quarter. So the combination of those is really -- the really big effect is the absence of the shutdown days from the third quarter.","Seth Weber","But it looks like it's going to be up year-over-year as well pretty nicely.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think it will be. Probably 10% or so would be my guess.","Seth Weber","Right, okay. And is that share gains? I mean I don't think the market is up that much though, right?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So one of the things that has been beneficial for DAF is the fact that there's more sales this year outside of Europe, the European truck registration market. So you look at what we're selling into Russia, selling into the Indian region and South America, into Australia, into Africa, so all those things have supplemented DAF's build rate during the course of this year.","Seth Weber","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up question. I think people are trying to kind of get at this, but maybe just coupling together some of the questions that have been asked about for next year for pricing and mix and whatnot, incremental margins. I mean, in this area where volumes are up next year, would you expect gross margin to be up next year?","Ronald Armstrong","Right now, I guess I would say I expect gross margin for next year to be comparable to what we're seeing in 2017 at the market size estimates we've provided. I would say that if you look at the build rates for DAF and Peterbilt and Kenworth where they're currently at, if those build rates were able to be sustained for all of next year, the markets would probably be at the upper end of our estimates that we've provided for 2018.","Seth Weber","Okay. So something in the kind of mid-14%, I think your...","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, mid-14%, yes, plus or minus.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Tiss","I wonder, maybe you can fuss it up for the whole industry. But is there expected to be another increment to fuel efficiency as we go into 2019?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, I think a big increase in fuel efficiency came with the engines that were launched this year. So DAF, 7% was a combination of fuel efficiency gains from the engine as well as aerodynamics of the enhanced vehicle features. And Peterbilt and Kenworth had a 4%, 5% increase at the beginning of this year with the model year '17 engine. So the next big increment, I think, will be in the 2020, 2021 time frame as we continue on the path of working on the 2021 greenhouse gas regulations.","But there'll be ongoing increments each year as we have to get certified each year and we continue to make investments in the capability of our hardware. But even more importantly is the capability of our software. So we're investing a lot more in our company today in software capability, software development for engine programming, truck control units and the integration of all that into a solid system. So that's where you're going to see some of the gains in the coming years, is that continuous improvement in the integration of all elements of the truck and the powertrain.","Joel Tiss","And then your market share of orders seems to be running noticeably ahead of your reported market share, your market share of deliveries. And I guess that's not enough to get you to be a little closer to where kind of industry forecasts are for 2018. Do you still think it's prudent to be on the conservative side?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. I think we're reasonably conservative at this point. And we haven't started the year and we're trying to predict what next year is going to be. I think we feel confident it will be a better year. And we'll see, as the year goes on, how it progresses.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","So my first question is just around Brazil, what you're seeing there and I guess the expectation for that region as we move into 2018.","Ronald Armstrong","Well, our team was just at the Fenatran truck show last week. And I would say the optimism of the industry and our team is good as we enter 2018. We've seen an increased quoting activity in the market. We've increased our build rates as we've progressed through this year, and we'll start next year at even higher build rates. So the market is recovering. We just launched a new truck for heavy haul applications in agricultural industry. And so that is going to give us some additional product capability in the market. So we're pretty bullish about what the near term looks like for Brazil in terms of being on the road to recovery and taking advantage of that and continuing to grow our share in that market.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about material costs. How much of a headwind was that to your truck margins this quarter? And how do you think about the headwind to material costs into next year since commodity costs have continued to move higher?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. It's been a bit of a headwind. Last year, we enjoyed some benefits, a bit of a tailwind, if you will. And this year has been a bit of a headwind. But I see next year -- again, it's not a significant effect. We do have the long-term agreements with our customers -- our suppliers, excuse me, that allow us to work those in ratably and work those into our pricing into the market. So I don't see it being a significant item as we go into next year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew Casey","Can you talk about the engine penetration in North America? Did that remain stable? Or did it improve?","Ronald Armstrong","It's actually down just slightly. And when you compare our penetration this year to last year, we offer our customers the PACCAR option and the Cummins option. Cummins is a great, great partner of ours. And so it really depends a lot on who's ordering at a particular given time, but we continue to enjoy great success with the engine. It's very well received by the customers, and we continue to work on getting increased penetration. So I'd say just down slightly a little bit this year compared to last year.","Andrew Casey","Okay. And then within the Financial Services segment, provisions appeared to come down a little bit sequentially, and that's good. I'm just wondering what drove the improvement. And was there any regional concentration behind that?","Ronald Armstrong","Andy, that portfolio is performing great and has for really post 2010. And so any movement in those provisions typically has to do with the amount of the assets that we have. But the amount of actual credit losses that we're seeing are pretty isolated. And there's no indication that the customers' ability to pay is going to be affected anytime soon with pretty robust transportation markets in all the markets where we're doing financing at this point.","Andrew Casey","Okay, Ron. And then just an industry question specific to North America. I'm just wondering if you've seen any irrational price discounting going on given one of your competitors has a stated goal of trying to recover some share that they've lost over the years.","Ronald Armstrong","No, I don't think we've seen that. We've been able to -- we have a great value proposition for our customers' with our products, with the aftermarket support that we provide, with parts and really supporting the uptime of our customers, great financing product. So I think the total package -- I mean we still are able to earn a premium with the quality of all the things that we provide our customers. So we've not seen anything -- there's always the isolated instance or isolated deal or somebody may do something that you scratch your head about, but that's no general trend.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Quick question. I know you don't run the company for the stock, and the stock kind of broke out of that 60s range. Now we're in the 70s. But I am trying to reconcile -- are we saying next year there's no operating leverage? I'm just trying to reconcile -- look, obviously, with the earnings power here, the idea is, as we get a little further in the cycle, you get some price-cost to your benefit, you get some leverage and we can be talking about $5 of earnings next year, on its way to maybe $5.50-plus. But when there's no operating leverage, that puts a lot of pressure on the U.S., Canadian market, just given the European market is at a high historical level. And I'm just trying to make sure we leave this call understanding you're comfortable saying next year gross margins are similar to this year. I mean, why is there no operating leverage in the model at all? Is it again costs going up for technology and so forth? Just so we're on the same page. I'm a little disappointed that your gross margin's similar next year to this year.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. I think that's our current assessment. I mean, there's obviously some upside potential as we progress through the year. We'll see how that develops. So right now, we're thinking 14.5%, plus or minus, from there. And so the factories -- we've made some great investments. The factories are operating very efficiently. And we'll see how pricing develops during the course of the year. So I think somewhere between that 14% to 15% range is sort of where we think things will develop as we progress.","David Raso","I mean, given the lead times and so forth. And look I appreciate competitive dynamics. But in your backlog today, how far does your U.S., Canadian business project out orders already on hand? How many months into next year? And is the pricing better in that backlog than we were shipping over the last, say, 6 months?","Ronald Armstrong","No. Typically, the extended backlog is longer-term buyers, fleet buyers. And so what fills in, in the shorter term is the stocking trucks, the smaller customers. And the margins in the backlog are generally consistent with what we're building currently.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of David Leiker of Robert W. Baird.","David Leiker","A couple of things. I had another gross profit margin question but a little bit different. You made some comments early on about the -- I believe it's about the gross profit margin in Q3. I'm just curious with the revenue gains -- and maybe this is tied to what David was just saying, with the revenue gains you saw in this quarter, that didn't really drive any gross margin profit improvement.","Ronald Armstrong","So you're talking about compared to the third quarter of last year?","David Leiker","Last year, yes. Revenues are up 20%, and gross profit's down 20 basis points.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So I think there, you've got the higher mix of trucks. You do have a bit of material cost headwind, and we continue to see some of the currency impacts with the British pound versus the euro and the Mexican peso. So those are just things that impact the margins, but we continue to work through those. And the opportunities for us to continue to grow the business, continue to generate good returns for our shareholders, we see those as -- continue to be consistent with what we've achieved in the past with respect to incremental margin.","David Leiker","Yes. I knew you mentioned it earlier. I've missed it so thanks for catching me up on that. On the aftermarket, with the TRP brand, obviously, you're growing faster there than what the market's growing. Where do you think those share gains are coming from?","Ronald Armstrong","I would guess they're coming from warehouse distributors, would be where I would think we get most of our upside with our TRP brand and the ability to service and have greater access to second and third owners of really All Makes of trucks.","David Leiker","And do you think those are coming from other private labels or from branded products?","Ronald Armstrong","I mean, obviously, whatever the warehouse distributor -- they're distributing, there are some private labels and vendor stuff. And so we're getting better access to that customer base than what we've had previously when you're just going through the Peterbilt or Kenworth or DAF dealer network.","David Leiker","Yes. And then just one last here. Thanks for the insight into next year. We've had a pretty strong market here or pretty high volumes. Do you have any -- what are the signs? What are you watching, the signposts that this market's getting too long in the tooth and you start to batten down a little bit and hunker down for tough times ahead? What are those signs that you'd be looking for?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, I mean, just ongoing discussions with customers, with dealers and order activity is the sign that tells us how things are going. And so order activity is aligned with the market estimates that we've provided.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher","Could you just give us some color on levels of used inventories on the PACCAR lots or stores that were opened in last year or so to deal with the excess used inventories that we're starting to build up?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So our used truck inventory has declined progressively throughout this year. And so as we end the third quarter, we're at our lowest level of used trucks that we've had. So we're well positioned with a good level of inventory to sell into the market, both out of our retail sales locations as well as through our dealers. So we're right where we feel we need to be with respect to used truck inventories.","Steven Fisher","Okay, great. And then can you just talk some more about the mix in parts margin this quarter? I would have thought that the margins would have been helped by the volumes that you had. I don't know if there's any particular drag from opening more stores and if you get a better margin once you have that expansion.","Ronald Armstrong","No, I think it's typically -- parts margins are typically driven by the mix of the product lines that we might sell during any given period, so proprietary versus vendor versus TRP versus PACCAR genuine. So there's lots of different levels of parts. And typically, the margin movement is affected more by mix than sales prices or material cost movement.","Steven Fisher","So how is your mix this quarter relative to what it's been?","Ronald Armstrong","I don't have those figures in front of me, I'm sorry.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research.","Robert Wertheimer","I had a question. I mean, I kind of agree with all your sentiments on the time frame on electrification of trucks, which obviously is going to take a number of years. I'm curious what your customers are telling you. As you're going out there and doing research and figuring out how urgently you need to think about developing products or whatever, are there segments -- I mean, is it only medium-duty customers that are interested? Or is it only ports where you've got restriction, obviously restrictions on emissions? Do you think that the long-haul stuff makes little sense to me, but maybe you're hearing it from them. So I'm just curious what portion of your customers in various segments are really interested in the developments?","Ronald Armstrong","I think all segments are interested. But I think when you look at the economic reality, the smaller the vehicle, the more likely that technology has application. So it's just going to be a while. There needs to be a breakthrough in battery technology for that really to be commercially viable for -- the higher up you go in the truck market. So I think everybody is interested. Everybody wants to know what we're doing, and we've got a lot of things that we're exploring. But the economic viability, as it stands today, like I say, it's more midterm than it is near term.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay. And then could you give a quick update on Russia, which has been boom and bust and where you've had success in previous years?","Ronald Armstrong","Good market. This year, DAF has been able to increase its share up on the 15% range from 11% or 12% in some of the prior years. We have good dealer representation, good support for the product. So it's a good market and one that we're taking advantage of as it currently sits.","Robert Wertheimer","Does that need -- I mean, it's been so volatile. I mean does that -- could that stay high for another 2, 3 years? Or is there any signs of saturation? And maybe more broadly in Europe on used trucks or the flow of used trucks or however you guys measure it, because the trade cycles are a little bit different, does it still look healthy, not just orders but the -- those Eastern markets where some of the trucks go?","Harrie Schippers","A market like Russia is a lot stronger this year than it was last year. Historically, it's still at pretty low level. It's not back to the levels where it was several years ago. And it's a market for Euro 5 trucks. Our DAF trucks performed very well there. The customers liked the quality, the fuel efficiency, and our share has grown from -- to a level of around 15% year-to-date in that market. So really, really good story there for DAF in Russia.","Robert Wertheimer","Great. And any comment at all on just how you think about, I guess it was asked before, cycle indicators on used trucks in Europe, whether we can stay up here at these levels for a while longer, whether there's any hint of saturation in trucks being absorbed by the second buyers wherever they are?","Ronald Armstrong","I mean, used truck market is pretty steady, I guess I'd say. Again, one of the positive aspects that DAF and PACCAR Financial in Europe will experience is the fact that starting next year and on for the coming years, that there'll be more and more of the Euro 6 product that will be coming back off lease, coming in on trades. And we'll have the newer models to sell in the used truck market. So overall demand at this point and pricing seems to be pretty steady.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mike Baudendistel of Stifel.","Michael Baudendistel","With regard to your outlook for North America in 2018 and beyond, how do your thoughts on electronic logging device mandate play into that?","Ronald Armstrong","At this point, it's a lot more talk than there is actual impact, what we're seeing in the market. So that obviously goes into play in December. And so we'll see how it develops. But right now, it doesn't feel like it's a significant element in truck orders and truck buying decisions.","Michael Baudendistel","Great. That's helpful. And then just one on Europe. It looks like the bottom end of your range for next year is below this year. I mean, it didn't seem like you've said anything that's negative about Europe so far in this call. I mean, what areas could concern you that could make Europe be down next year?","Ronald Armstrong","There's no real areas of concern. I'd say, at this point, that the bottom end of our range is conservatism. As I mentioned previously, if we continued with our build rates as they currently sit at DAF and Peterbilt and Kenworth, the markets would be at the upper end of our estimate. So the lower end just really reflects some conservatism.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapple of Buckingham Research.","Neil Frohnapple","I think there was an earlier question on SG&A for the fourth quarter. But can you provide any granularity on the SG&A expense outlook for 2018 like you guys have done for R&D?","Ronald Armstrong","I think if you look at the -- probably the second half run rate for SG&A, some of the effect in the second half has been there's just some little stronger currencies with respect to the euro, et cetera. So I think if you look at the second half run rate of SG&A, that's probably indicative of what we would expect for full year 2018 in terms of absolute dollars.","Neil Frohnapple","Got it, okay. And then could you talk about what drove the acceleration of PACCAR Financial Services revenue growth in the quarter? And I guess as a follow-up to that, is that also good run rate views for 4Q and 2018?","Ronald Armstrong","So the revenue is just we have a bit of an increasing interest rate environment, we have higher assets and we had the higher mix of operating leases in our portfolio. So there's several things that impact that. As we think about next year, right now, we anticipate that the portfolio will continue to perform well, that our customers will have good economic conditions in which to operate. And so credit losses will continue to be muted. Used truck values seem to have stabilized, and so I don't think we'll see any challenges on the used truck side. So as it sits here today, we feel good about our prospects for 2018 in the Financial Services arena .","Operator","And you have a follow-up question from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just wanted to clarify one thing. Would your operating leverage be more evident at the gross profit level or at the pretax profit level?","Ronald Armstrong","Probably at the pretax profit level because we sort of manage our R&D and SG&A more to a fixed cost.","Steven Fisher","Right. So to kind of frame it as there's no operating leverage in the model as we think about next year, maybe more appropriate to think about the pretax level no matter how much fixed costs you have in your gross profit, but ...","Ronald Armstrong","It's going to depend on how the year progresses and how material costs develop. And we're well positioned. And at this point, again, I think margins would be in that 14% to 15%. And whether they're at the upper end or lower end of that range depends on a lot of factors that are to be determined.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ronald Armstrong","We'd like to thank everyone for their participation, and thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; Bob Christensen, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","[Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the third quarter of 2013. PACCAR's third quarter sales and financial services revenue were $4.3 billion, and quarterly net income was $309 million, an after-tax return on revenues of 7.2%. This is the best after-tax return on revenue in 5 years.","Net income increased 32% compared to the results generated in the third quarter last year. I'm very proud of our 22,700 employees, who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR's third quarter truck results reflect improved reflect improved industry truck sales in North America and Europe compared to the third quarter last year. PACCAR is in the final stages of the largest new truck and engine family launch in our history.","In the next 6 weeks, we'll begin production of our new vocational vehicles, the Peterbilt Model 567, the Kenworth T880 and the DAF CF Euro 6. In addition, we'll begin production of our new MX-11 diesel engine for Europe. Our new assembly plant in Brazil began producing DAF Trucks in early October and will gradually increase production over the next 18 to 24 months. The Brazil truck market, greater than 6 tonnes for next year, is estimated to be approximately 150,000 units.","I'm also pleased to note that PACCAR's manufacturing trucks on every continent, except Antarctica. Our customers and dealers are very excited about the many new vehicles and services that PACCAR is delivering to the market. PACCAR delivered 35,400 trucks during the third quarter, a 2% increase versus the second quarter and in line with our projections. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 205,000 to 215,000 units this year. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry truck sales next year are expected to improve to be in the range of 210,000 to 240,000 units, reflecting ongoing replacement demand and some expansion of industry fleet capacity.","European truck orders jumped in the third quarter as customers purchased trucks ahead of the January 1, 2014, implementation of the Euro 6 environmental regulations. Third quarter DAF truck orders increased by 70% compared to a year ago and were up 16% compared to the second quarter.","In Europe, the greater than 16-tonne truck market is projected to be in the range of 215,000 to 225,000 units this year. DAF deliveries in the fourth quarter will benefit from the pre-buy. I'd also like to note that DAF's new Euro 6 vehicles are receiving very good industry reviews, and customers are pleased with the new products.","Looking at the industry, it's anticipated that the greater than 16-tonne European truck market next year will be in the range of 200,000 to 230,000 vehicles.","PACCAR's truck deliveries worldwide in the fourth quarter are expected to increase by about 5% compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter gross margins should improve compared to the third quarter, reflecting higher truck production.","There are also a number of encouraging economic indicators in North America that should benefit truck demand. First, residential and commercial construction activity is improving. Housing starts in the U.S. are projected to be approximately 900,000 units this year. Second, North American auto production is expected to be over 15 million vehicles this year. And third, freight tonnage in the U.S. is at a seasonally adjusted record level. These economic improvements have enabled our dealers and customers to generate strong results.","PACCAR Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $715 million, an increase of 10% compared to $650 million in the same quarter last year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $107 million, an increase of 20% compared to $89 million earned in the third quarter last year. The excellent results were driven by strong freight tonnage and improved fleet utilization.","PACCAR Financial Services revenue were $294 million in the third quarter compared to $274 million in the third quarter last year. PACCAR Financial third quarter pretax income was a record $88 million compared to $80 million earned last year. The excellent results benefited from growth in asset balances and the continuing strong portfolio performance.","PACCAR's capital spending is estimated to be $425 million to $475 million this year. In 2014, capital investment is estimated to be $350 million to $400 million. Research and development expenses this year are estimated to be $250 million to $260 million, while next year R&D will be in the range of $225 million to $275 million.","The positive contribution of all of the company's segments has enabled PACCAR to attain the highest operating margins in our industry and to deliver excellent shareholder returns while investing during all phases of the business cycle. PACCAR's average annual shareholder return over the last decade was 13.1%. Shareholder return is 24.5% through September this year.","PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by launching many new products and services and by continuing to invest in new geographic regions. Thank you. I'll be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if we could dig into the margins a little bit. Versus my model, they're a little better than I expected, which is great, obviously.","Mark C. Pigott","Good news.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And -- yes, of course, and was curious if you might be able to bucket for us kind of what's starting to go right on the margin front and how sustainable we think this is going to be.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we indicated that we estimate that margins in the fourth quarter should be a little bit better than the third quarter. We have come out with a lot of new products this year, as you're aware, and we're starting to see some benefits from that. Also, our customers, over the last few years, have done pretty well, so there might be a slight improvement in industry pricing, and working with our suppliers on reducing some supplier costs is having a benefit. So I think all in all, those are probably 3 primary reasons.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And is there any reason that any of those things should not continue to sort of improve as we get into 2014?","Mark C. Pigott","I think we're working hard on all 3 of those main avenues to continue that positive trend.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then can I just ask you your view on what's happening in Europe? And I guess specifically obviously sort of some eye-popping numbers on the DAF orders this quarter, do we pay all that back in the first quarter next year? Or how do you think that unfolds?","Mark C. Pigott","I think that order intake, if you -- well, obviously, you've have had some very good success as I think the entire industry has in terms of the pre-buy, there's a couple of other elements to consider. One, we're still waiting, as the whole industry is, for Germany to share their thoughts on any MAUT discount, so I look at that as a bit of an incentive to purchase Euro 6. We expect that in the next month or so. So that'll be a benefit for the industry. I think in terms of orders, we're finding very good success with our customers on acceptance of the Euro 6 vehicles. They perform well. They have good fuel economy. They're attractive and continue to lower the cost of operation for our customers, so we take that as a good sign. But you have to overlay that with what's happening throughout the Eurozone and some of the challenges ongoing. The U.K. is having a remarkable uptick in their economic performance, and that's a strong market for DAF, and -- but -- we're looking forward to next year. We've got great products. We continue to add dealers. We're growing in Central Europe. We're growing in Russia. We're growing in Turkey, and so there's a lot of positive momentum for the DAF.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So just to be clear on that, you're saying you have some reasonable orders for Euro 6 trucks already?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we do. Yes. Absolutely. Good questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a clarification. When I think about your margin performance in the quarter, your operating margin improved sequentially. Your gross profit improved, I think, year-over-year, but sequentially, it was just sort of flat. So when you think about where we should see the margin improvement, do you see, going forward, it improving more on sort of the gross profit margin line or on the operating margin line or both? And then I just guess my second question. On the pricing environment, as we look to 2014, do you think you'll be able to pass through the full cost of the Euro 6 price increase? And then also your view on your ability to hold price and market share with Navistar, with the Cummins engine back in the market?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Well, with respect to the question about gross profit, when we talked about margins in the opening comments, we were talking about the gross profit will benefit, in the fourth quarter, from the higher production levels. So that will pass through to the operating profit line. With respect to Euro 6, Euro 6 does have a cost uptick, and we're working with our customers and trying to realize what the potential of the product. Product is great. The customers have received it very well, and we're excited about being able to offer that in the European market as we begin next year.","And then your final question about market share growth. We're and have been for 108 years are focused on high quality and great returns to our shareholders. There's always competitors. Each of them have their own unique approach to the marketplace. They come, they go, sometimes they even come back when you think they're gone. So I'm sure that we'll continue to have good share and great support from our customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. In the North American market, I'm trying to reconcile the difference between what we're seeing in some of the very strong indicators and industry orders up through September. And we're hearing a lot of mixed signals from some of your North American customers. I'm just wondering if the normal order acceleration took hold so far in October.","Mark C. Pigott","We're seeing some improvement in October. I think you've accurately summarized the economic environment in, let's call it, the U.S. and Canada. I think Mexico is a separate market again. There is a lot of different types of signals facing our customers and their end customers. We're looking for some general economic growth to kick in, and that's going to -- that's more than just the trucking industry. But we are seeing some improvement in orders. Once again, we've got a whole new range of Kenworth and Peterbilt products that have been well received, and our PACCAR engine is doing well. Our customers are making money. Some of them are not making as much money as they did a year ago. There are different industry factors affecting that. But overall, we have some positive GDP growth, which we are, this year, and we hope to have an improved GDP next year. It should benefit all of us.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then flipping over to Europe, if I could. The orders, as Steve had said in a prior question, quite impressive. Did you continue to see most of the Euro 5 pre-buy, meaning against the Euro 6 standard next year, happening in the U.K.? Or did that spread out into some other regions?","Mark C. Pigott","No, it was throughout Europe, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit more about your expectation for Q4? I think for sales to be up 5% how that would split out between the U.S. and Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think on the truck side, I think we'll see most of the improvement will be in Europe because of the benefit from the, call it the pre-buy. And U.S. and Canada would be sort of in line with what's been going on. There's a few less production days during the quarter. Then, of course, we have the parts and finance business, which continue to perform well and are achieving many record levels, and they're working hard to keep that going.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When you think about a 70% increase in orders, which is just a staggering number in Q3 for DAF, I mean, how are you positioned from a capacity perspective to fulfill those orders by the end of the year? And can you actually deliver some of those orders in 2014?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we have increased our production rates about 4x in the last 2 months to meet that increased demand. Even at the production rates we're at now, they're still a little bit lower than we were back in 2007, 2008. So we do have the capacity infrastructure. And obviously, it takes a lot of coordination, working with our suppliers, very good suppliers, and because they've got to ramp up recognizing that the first quarter next year will return to more normal levels. So there's very much of an integrated logistics approach here.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess what I'm getting at is that could some of that 70% order -- increase in order intake spill over into the 2014 year?","Mark C. Pigott","Not per the guidelines that each of the countries have. I mean, the good news is that we're getting a very good response on the Euro 6 vehicles, and that is certainly the focus now of our customers and our dealers, who have been processing, as you've indicated, a lot of Euro 5. And that has pretty much come to a conclusion and now people are saying, \"Hey, I love these DAF Euro 6 vehicles. Let's start selling those and getting those in the factories.\" So we're filling up the first quarter with Euro 6. Also, the Euro 5 will continue to be a factor outside of Western Europe. So Russia, Turkey, Middle East, Africa, Australia, China, Taiwan. So that will still be an ongoing contribution to our production through next year and actually for probably 2 or 3 years.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on Brazil, how are you progressing with some of your dealer network? And do you feel obviously that the long-term opportunity is enormous, but do you feel like the mood has changed at all given some of the concerns on the Brazilian economy?","Unknown Executive","No, we don't feel that the mood has changed at all. In fact, the heavier side of the Brazilian business is actually performing quite well. We're very encouraged with the way things are developing on our project in Brazil. The dealer body is very active constructing their new facilities, training their people. This week, all of our dealers are participating in the Fenner tran show in South America, and we expect to gradually improve our deliveries in Brazil over the next 12 months.","Mark C. Pigott","That's exciting, exciting times, and the truck market in Brazil is continuing to grow. We registered our first group of DAF Trucks a month or so ago, so that was a memorable highlight. And the factory is good. I think there's videos and pictures on the Internet. So it's going very, very well, and we'll be there next 50 to 100 years. We're looking forward to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, in the first half of the year, you guys saw a decent pickup in vocational truck activity. Can you talk about whether you've seen follow through in that activity? Or maybe any falloff in construction maybe was a little bit soft in the summer?","Mark C. Pigott","The vocational, as you indicated, we have seen some improvement. We're also very excited about launching our new vocational products here in the next 6 weeks of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF, which I think will give us a nice boost. And certainly, our dealers and customers are looking forward to it. There has been a little bit of slowdown in some of the vocational markets, but there's still a lot more demand than there was a year ago, so we're taking advantage of that. So when we go to vocational shows, we talk with our end customers. They haven't been purchasing for a number of years, so they're excited to be back in the market, and they're very excited by the new products that we're launching.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, Mark, that's helpful. Maybe just a follow-up on another question, previous questions. How do you plan for production in the EU given the spike you're seeing here? And then next year, you're forecasting relatively flattish market. Does that mean that the second half of this year is somewhat flat with the first half of next year, but you'll have lumpiness within that production? Do you understand what I'm saying?","Mark C. Pigott","I do. It's a great question. First of all, well, you plan it as far in advance as you can, and it's obviously an integrated program with our suppliers, as I mentioned earlier. In terms of the production for the second half versus the first half, I think the second half will be higher production than the first half. And yes, I don't know, I won't consider it lumpiness. I consider it opportunity to make more trucks but...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to be clear, I know this question has gotten asked a hundred times different ways. But from everything you've said, Mark, we should be putting plus 70% in our models for DAF for fourth quarter. Is that correct?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no, that is not correct. But it's a nice thought. No, we're talking about overall 5% for the company. That's the -- that's our shared guidance.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. But DAF specifically, you're saying orders are up 70% and they have to be delivered before year-end.","Mark C. Pigott","They're up compared to a year ago. And -- but we've also increased through this year, so you have to take a look at the increase from the second quarter of DAF, which were up 16%. And then obviously, the rest of the world, some are going up, some are going down. So overall for PACCAR, it's 5%, which is a very good, robust number, I believe.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. It seems a little conservative. And then just the cynic in me wants to say, customers are so excited about the Euro 6, why, are we seeing any prebuying at all?","Mark C. Pigott","Ann, you've been in this industry quite a long time. It's just the industrial pre-buy psychology, that's what people do. Obviously, there is a price increase in the marketplace of between EUR 10,000 and EUR 15,000. So if you're a customer and that's a major consideration, you have to make the best business case for your own business. That's typically why we see a pre-buy.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, okay. And I was being cynical. And your dealers in your Europe so, I mean, can you talk a little bit about where do the used trucks go? I've heard some dealers in Europe articulate some concerns that once these Euro 6 trucks roll out and come back to the dealers, they lose a lot of their potential and used equipment sales markets because a lot of European used equipment goes to Eastern Europe, goes to Africa, places that don't have ultra-low-sulfur diesel. Are your dealers talking about that at all? Is that a potential issue 3, 4 years down the road?","Mark C. Pigott","There are some very minor discussion, but I think, as you pointed out, it is 3, 4, 5, 6 years down the road. Each country, and we're in 100 countries around the world, is proactively trying to meet North American and European environmental regulations. So I would expect that a number of years down the road, there'd be more regions of the country that are adopting almost a global environmental standard. And so I think that the used trucks will have many happy homes wherever they go.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, real quick, in Brazil, are you hearing anything about higher interest rates or the potential for no tsunami [ph] next year given the fact that we have an election and interest rates are rising? What are you guys hearing kind of from feet on the street tender on tsunami? [ph]","Unknown Executive","We're expecting the program to continue into 2014 but perhaps at slightly higher rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the Europe production ramp in the fourth quarter, can we just -- how do you address that? Will you be hiring temporary employees? And how should we think about the expenses related to managing that production?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we do flex our employment rate, utilizing some temporary workers, and that's a pretty common industry practice and been going on for quite a few years. And it works well for everybody. And as I've indicated, the production increase from, let's call it, second to third quarter, it's probably 5% to 7% for DAF and then continue to increase that. So I think the 70% it's -- we're very pleased to get the number of orders, but I don't think that should be taken as a stand-alone number in terms of production increase.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sure. No, I understand. I'm just trying to understand if, I mean, if your expenses may flex up here in the fourth quarter, do they then come back down in the first quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, they move sort of in sync with our truck production. So obviously, we're selling more trucks. We're manufacturing more trucks, and we need more material and labor to -- in order to produce those trucks. So it moves in sync; don't think it's anything. It's very normal.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It's not out of bounds with the normal...","Mark C. Pigott","It's very normal.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Brazil, can you just remind us what's your market share targets are for that market over the -- in maybe 2014 and over the next couple of years?","Mark C. Pigott","Over the next couple of years, as I shared in my opening comments, we're just looking for a steady, gradual growth, sort of 18 to 24 months. Longer term, as we said in a number of press releases, we'd like to achieve 20% share, which is our target in all of our markets, but it's early days. We're pleased to be getting the production of DAF Trucks and we're just beginning the whole process. So steady as she goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, can you talk about your Parts business, really strong acceleration this quarter on a year-over-year basis, excellent performance. Can you just give us some context which regions were up more than others? How broad-based is that?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. I think the Parts team have done a remarkable job. When you look at a couple of things of why they've been able to achieve that. First, we have the largest population of PACCAR vehicles in our history out running around between 1.5 million and 2 million vehicles, Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks. Second, we've got the most dealers in our history. Third, we've increased share over the last number of years from, let's call it, 22% to almost 30% in North America and in Europe from, certainly, 10% to 16%. So we just have a lot more activity out in the marketplace. Complementing that, the Parts group has -- have been very innovative in developing their TRP, their all makes brand, and also working with the customers you typically wouldn't think of, whether it's the bus market or gen sets or industrial equipment who need parts. So they really had a broad approach to the parts marketplace. And we continue to add our distribution centers. I know a number of companies seem to get a lot of press when they add distribution centers. Well, we're adding distribution centers. We just opened up our largest one in the last year in Eindhoven, 280,000 square feet. We just opened up a new one in Brazil. We just double the size of one in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. So you take all those very positive investments and approaches, and the result is you got a Parts business that is continuing to grow and generate good returns.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess using it as a proxy to understand where your customers are doing better than in other regions, is it stronger in Europe versus North America? Is it possible to break that out on a year-over-year basis?","Mark C. Pigott","I think North America is a little bit stronger. Europe is improving, but it has a little bit of the flavor of some economic challenge, but it's good all the way around the world.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And, Mark, in North America, can you talk about, based on your conversation with customers, how you expect the order cadence to play out over the next couple of quarters? I know you folks are the first to adjust your build rates to any changes in customer demand trends. So I'm wondering how do you see it beyond 4Q based on your customer conversations? How are the discussions going relative to your planned 4Q build rates.","Unknown Executive","Sure. In North America, the discussions are going very well. As Mark indicated, generally our customers, their utilization rates are high. Rates are maybe not as great as they would like, but they're definitely looking at replacing the fleet and looking for some growth with economic growth.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, Mark, you mentioned about the ramp higher in Europe that you're executing here. How difficult is it to transition into the first quarter? I know you folks have done it countless times, but just help us understand how complex is that process and how challenging will margin profile be in the first quarter if it will be challenging.","Mark C. Pigott","I think the teams are very used to the ebb and flow of the industry and do it very, very well. We have a lot of great people working in. Obviously, we also have a lot of good systems, whether it's the PACCAR production system, and we're also a leader on Six Sigma. So I think in just terms of building more trucks or building less trucks, that is part of what our team does. I think, the first quarter will probably be more in line with the rest of the year excluding the pre-buy. So we're looking for a reasonable quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So I just wonder if you could give us a sense of the cost that you spent throughout 2013 on your expansion that might be going away as we go into '14.","Mark C. Pigott","I think the -- well, we've kind of shared the R&D and the CapEx, and I think that shows a slight reduction, which reflects a lot of these projects coming to fruition. I think the other one is as we began to ramp up Brazil, there should be some benefit from the reduction or the elimination of startup and construction costs. We've got a great factory there and starting to build trucks. So I think that'll have some benefits for the company.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then as you look out, say, over the next couple of years, you still have quite a bit of cash. You're generating a lot of free cash flow. You've done your Brazilian project. Can you give us a sense of what's kind of in the planning stages, or what are you thinking about over the next 5 years areas to expand into?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we want to obviously keep all of our products leading edge. So that's an ongoing program for any company in the automotive industry. We also want to continue to expand our services. We've got great success with our finance and lease operations, which we see has more opportunities. And then you've got all of Asia, which we've had good success. We've been there for many decades, but it's still relatively small contributor to our overall profits and sales. So that's got to be an area in a region that has a lot of potential if we can do it in a correct manner, and we've had a lot of time to study it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just regionally, the other category in the quarter I think it was down about 20% year-over-year. Can you just talk about what drove that?","Unknown Executive","Okay, you bet. Most of that was currency movements.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So the underlying organic, was that up?","Unknown Executive","Our winds business was down a bit.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, separately, can you just give us a sense of how many weeks of production you have in backlog today? And then should we expect that, that would come down as you deliver the European pre-buy over the course of the quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","I -- we don't typically break out weeks of production. But I think in line with the rest of the European industry, we're essentially sold out in Europe through the end of the year. And the rest of our production backlog is in line with what's going on in the industry.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe lastly, can you just remind us how many units you expect to ship out of Brazil in the fourth quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","I don't think we've actually ever broken that out. It's just early days. It's just ramping up the factory at this time. So it's --","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I thought the number was somewhere around like a few hundred. That's an order of magnitude?","Mark C. Pigott","I think it's in that range, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a quick question on R&D. I know we asked you this, Mark, on last call and you sort of said you might get some small benefit. We had 2 quarters of decently low R&D. Are you going to be in a mode where you're able to harvest a lot of the good investment you've made over the past couple of years and sort of stay at this level? Or will it bounce back up?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we've indicated for next year that we see R&D and CapEx will be slightly lower than what we're doing this year. But it's a very exciting industry. You've got to keep investing. There's always opportunities to come out with new products. We also have different regulatory programs that we're working with in different parts of the world. Greenhouse gas comes to mind, new engine and powertrain regulations. So that all takes certainly a fair amount of capital and R&D. So I think in terms of harvesting, we look for these wonderful new products and services to generate good returns for our customers, our dealers and ourselves. That'll be the harvest, the bountiful harvest.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then just one minor one. Did turning on the Brazil plant make any impact on gross margin, either this quarter or will it next?","Mark C. Pigott","No, not really, no. And I invite you to tour the plant. It's up and running. It's really looking good.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I was wondering if you could break out the percent of your production in Q4 that you think is going to be Euro 6 compliant versus Euro 5.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it'll be a portion. We probably won't break that out, but we are making Euro 6 product in Q4, and it's going well, but it's a minority.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Sure, right. Okay, fair enough. Then I was just wondering also, kind of a philosophical question, on 15-liter versus 13-liter in the North America, I guess, trucking market in general, not just for your company specifically, I know that you guys are making your vertically integrated with regard to the 13. So trying to push production of the 13 or sales of the 13, you have an incentive to do that. But industry-wide, do you think you're seeing a shift or I guess more regionalization among trucking companies and more preference as a result of the 13-liter?","Mark C. Pigott","That's a great topic. I'm glad you raised that. Right now -- and we've seen this trend over the last 5 years. The 13-liter is about the same as the 15-liter in terms of industry market share. That's for the whole industry. And it's interesting that there have been more new 13-liter engines introduced over the last 2 years than 15-liter from anybody in the industry as people -- and our customers certainly become aware that 13-liter has a lot of benefits. The fuel economy is very good. A little lighter weight, it has the same durability, reliability, a little lower cost. And essentially, it's the engine that is the high-end engine around the world in any region you go to, from Asia to Europe to Africa, South America. We just introduced our 11-liter, which we're beginning production. It'll be installed in the DAF product this year. And we're even hearing now from customers that for vocational, the 11-liter may be the engine of choice for that application, where you're driving within a 50-mile radius from your home, your base, it's got a lot of power, a lot of torque. And once again, it's a little lighter weight, a little lower cost, and it could be the solution that a lot of our customers are looking for. So I think like you see in the whole automotive industry, including cars, you're getting more power density and you see the car guys are now coming out with, I mean, even 1-liter engines and 2- and 3-liter engines, whereas 10 years ago, 15 years ago, those were 5- and 6- and 7-liter engines. So we see that same thing going on in the commercial vehicles.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Any willingness, I guess, to take a stab at what that 50-50 breakdown might be in 2014, 2015? Do you think -- how quickly do you think the 15-liter share deteriorates?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I look at it on a positive side as how fast the 13-liter can grow. But I think if you look out 5 years, I think the 13-liter will continue to increase its share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Mark, I was wondering if you could remind us what proportion of DAF build would be outside of the Euro 6 standards for next year.","Mark C. Pigott","I would say as we go forward, it's probably in the 15% to 20% range would be Euro 5 product and the remainder would be Euro 6 product.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay, got it. And then was there any impact to currency on earnings this quarter? And then also how are you thinking about the tax rate going forward?","Unknown Executive","Yes, we -- the impact on currencies was fairly muted. We got some benefit from the higher euro on revenues and a bit on income, and the tax rate we expect for the full year to be around 31%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna International.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I was just wondering if you could maybe give us a little more perspective on how sentiment feels among your North American clients, starting with kind of the owner\/operators versus small fleets midsized larger and then the private guys. I mean is there discernible differences in kind of how they're looking at 2014 and how much you characterize those?","Mark C. Pigott","Of course, the owner-operator market as we know it essentially has been amalgamated into fleets. So you're really talking about fleets, whether they're small, medium or large. And we've had different regulations, and different federal guidelines have been implemented in the last 12 months that they're now taking on board, whether it's hours of operation or just how the vehicle is going to be performing. But it's a very resilient dynamic industry, great fleet operators, great fleet owners. They've been around through a couple of pretty serious downturns over the last decade, and I think they're doing well. They're excited about the new products. They're seeing some general growth in the economy. We've got the vocational side starting to improve. Consumer size seems to be reasonable. So I think for North America, or U.S. and Canada, I think it should be a good year.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Would you see any distinction between long-haul and regional guys or shorter-haul customers?","Mark C. Pigott","I think you could say there might be some distinction between truckload versus less-than-truckload, but I think that's been in play for the last decade or so. But I think the customers that we typically work with across the board are in good shape.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And second thing I was hoping to ask is we saw the pretax margin -- margins for both trucks and parts. Could you give us a sense for what the gross margins look like for both of those businesses?","Unknown Executive","We typically don't break that out the gross margins.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we don't break that out.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I apologize. I know you thought you were done with me. Just one quick one there. Daimler has had a lot of success with this AMT transmission rollout. And can you just talk about -- you mentioned that as one of your longer-term investment priorities. Can you just give us an update of what's going on in the market? And how you think about being able to compete with that product longer term?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we've got 2 excellent transmission or gearbox suppliers, Eaton and ZF. Each of them has slightly different, although there some overlap in their approach in the marketplace. ZF is our primary supplier for the DAF product in Europe and wherever else we sell. DAF and then Eaton would be primarily for Kenworth and Peterbilt. And they've got products that compete very well against all of our competitors. And everybody's working on the same engineering premise in terms of making it truly an integrated powertrain from the engine, all the way back to the rear axles. And I think the success that we're getting with the PACCAR engine integrated with ZF or Eaton is standing up very well. And we continue to have very good shares, so we're having good success. So every automotive supplier is certainly evaluating their approach to powertrain and seeing if they can get a benefit for their customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","What was the MX engine penetration rate in North America in the third quarter for Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks?","Mark C. Pigott","35%.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","It ticked up from the second quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, very exciting, and we can keep working on it. Every year, we have certain goals. And if you have a chance to go down to the Mississippi factory, I encourage you to. It's a beautiful facility.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then along those lines, what percentage of your North American production in the third quarter were for the new products? I think you had mentioned 30% in the second quarter. Did that tick up also?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it did. Probably about 35% to 40%.","Operator","You have a follow-up question from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I forgot to ask about natural gas. In the context of your MX penetration on the 13-liter, we're hearing some very positive things about customers wanting to at least try out the 12-liter nat gas, the Westport Cummins. Can you talk about if that engine is successful, does that displace your 13-liter MX? Just talk about the dynamics there. Are Kenworth and Peterbilt still even offering a 15-liter HPDI?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we are, and we continue to have about 40% share in the natural gas industry. So we're very excited about that. And as that market grows, we expect to grow with it. Natural gas is about 1% of the total marketplace. Customers are starting to invest. The infrastructure is in the early stages of being built out. So we see that as an alternative fuel for customers that it makes sense for. And we're right there with it and, in fact, leading the way.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But you didn't answer my question, Mark. The 12-liter Cummins Westport is the offering that customers are leading towards. Does that displace the 13-liter MX?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, it's a good engine, and Cummins continue to be a major supplier to us, a major partner. And we offer a variety of engines, but I think in the big scheme of things, everybody happily coexists.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Would -- if that market took off, would you consider developing your own spark-ignited 13-liter?","Mark C. Pigott","There's always the opportunity to develop a whole new range of engines, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Johansson from UBS O'Connor.","Daniel Johansson","I was wondering on the order intake, the DAF order intake being up 70%, did you say what the book-to-bill was?","Mark C. Pigott","What is our production versus that?","Daniel Johansson","Yes, exactly. I mean, what you produced in the quarter and how the orders relate to that.","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. Well, we've -- we're talking about globally that PACCAR will increase its production by about 5% with slightly improved margins in the fourth quarter. We're seeing an increase in production at DAF, and we will complete building all of our Euro 5 vehicles for Western Europe this year but continue building Euro 5 vehicles for the rest of the world for at least the next few years.","Daniel Johansson","But did DAF get more orders in the third quarter than they produced?","Unknown Executive","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, yes. And some of those orders were also for Euro 6, which we are producing now and in the first quarter also.","Daniel Johansson","I mean a big portion of DAF is U.K. I think around 20%. And I believe U.K. has September 30 and not December 31 as the deadline, right?","Mark C. Pigott","That is correct, and we've essentially built all those vehicles for the U.K. We're still sound a little bit of a derogation.","Unknown Executive","We continue to build trucks for the U.K. with Euro 5 and Euro 6 in the fourth quarter. So it's ongoing. But very good.","Daniel Johansson","Okay. I mean, in terms of your -- dealers are in general, they are independent, right?","Mark C. Pigott","That is correct.","Daniel Johansson","And what is the normal lag between registration and when you ship to your dealers?","Mark C. Pigott","It depends. If it's for on-highway or if it's for vocational, and they need to get a body. So if a dealer gets a vehicle day 1 for on-highway, it can be registered into the customer's hand within a week or 2. If it's for a body, it can be anywhere from 4 to 12 weeks, depending on the backlog at the body manufacturer.","Daniel Johansson","So if we talk about the 2014 outlook with 2% to 3% down on midpoint, I believe, is that -- that is the registration number?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that's correct. In Europe, it's registration. That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions. Can you give me an idea of what set of circumstances gives you a number closer to the $225 million under the range versus the $275 million under the range?","Mark C. Pigott","I think as most companies do when you're looking out over the next 14 months, we like to have a range that provides for a lot of different eventualities. But I would think that the range would probably be on the lower half of that.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And the tax rate, 31%, I think, was the guidance for the year. I'm assuming that's based on your mix of global profits. Should I be thinking about, as I look forward, a different tax rate, 32%, 32.5% versus 31% kind of the range you think I should be thinking about given what you see right now?","Unknown Executive","Given our mix of global earnings, 31% is pretty close for this year. 31% to 32% next year, I think, would be a good way to think about it depending on global earnings.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. What's driving that down is just a higher mix of European and maybe Brazilian earnings?","Unknown Executive","Yes, the tax rate in Europe is in the low 20s, so that's a mix.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then just one final follow-up. In -- well, let me go away from that gas. Now that the Brazil plant is open, you did say it was going to be a ramp. You said no gross margin impact. But how should I think about the Brazilian plant impacting SG&A over the next few quarters as you do build up production?","Mark C. Pigott","I think as we look forward, we've had our dealer development people. We've got salespeople in place, so then we'll see some slight increase, but it's not going to be a major factor.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Robin E. Easton","I'd like to thank everyone for their excellent questions.

Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.","As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","PACCAR reported record revenues and strong operating results for the first quarter of 2018. PACCAR\u2019s first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $5.65 billion and first quarter net income was $512 million, a 9.1% after tax return on revenues. Revenues were 33% higher and net income was 65% higher compared to the first quarter last year.","PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly pre-tax profits of $192 million. PACCAR achieved excellent Truck, Parts and Other gross margins of 14.8% helped by strong global truck and aftermarket parts demand. First quarter margin is benefited from a favorable customer mix and increased seasonal demand for proprietary parts in the aftermarket.","I\u2019m very proud of our 26,000 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR delivered a record 44,500 trucks during the first quarter. U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry truck orders averaged 42,000 units per month in the first quarter and have exceeded 30,000 units per month for the last six months. DAF above 16-tonne orders increased 41% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Due to the robust orders, we expect to deliver 7% to 9% more trucks in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter. Second quarter gross margins for truck will be similar to the first quarter of around 12%. Parts margins will reflect increased sales of TRP and routine maintenance parts. Total Truck, Parts and Other gross margins will again be strong at the mid 14% level.","The U.S. economy growth is driving record freight tonnage. Customers are operating at high utilization levels and are expanding their fleets. We\u2019ve raised our estimate of U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales to a range of 265,000 to 285,000 vehicles this year. PACCAR\u2019s forecast for the European above 16-tonne market has been increased to a range of 300,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting the strong freight transport activity and truck demand as well as the steady economic outlook.","The new DAF CF and XF, which won the International Truck of the Year are seeing strong demand, achieving a 16.4% share of the European heavy truck market registrations in the first quarter.","PACCAR Parts quarterly pre-tax income of $192 million was 27% higher than a year ago. Pre-tax return on revenue was an excellent 20.4%. PACCAR Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $940 million, 19% higher than in the same quarter of last year. These results were driven by growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation, PACCAR\u2019s investment in distribution centers and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts and our dealers. For the year, we expect parts sales to increase by 10% to 12%.","PACCAR Financial Services first quarter pre-tax income was $68 million, 19% higher than first quarter last year. The PACCAR financial portfolio performed well. Industry demand and pricing for used trucks increased compared to the first quarter last year. PACCAR Financial continued to invest in the remarketing of PACCAR trucks by opening its fourth truck remarketing center near Los Angeles. These truck centers further enhance Kenworth and Peterbilt residual values, which command a 10% to 20% premium over competitors\u2019 trucks.","PACCAR\u2019s strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the Company to invest $3 billion in new products and facilities in the last five years. This year, capital expenditures of $425 million to $475 million, and research and development expenses of $300 million to $320 million are targeted for new truck models, integrated powertrains including electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, and new product technologies for advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity. Additional investments are also being made to expand and enhance manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. PACCAR is realizing the benefits of strong market conditions by delivering the highest quality products and services in the industry and investing for future growth.","Thank you. I\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Potter","Yes. Thanks, guys. First, I wanted to ask a question about the revenue growth in parts. You mentioned seasonality there but also the proprietary parts. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more clarity on what\u2019s driving that very strong year-over-year growth. And also, if you could, I guess in that context, talk about TRP, the extent to which that\u2019s contributing as well? Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Sure. The growth is really across all the product lines. Obviously, freight activity has a large impact. But our teams, we\u2019ve expanded our distribution facilities. We\u2019ve got lots of great programs with engines, with our fleet services, our e-commerce capabilities. So, the team has done a great job of really putting together programs that build the loyalty of our customers to PACCAR Parts because they can provide the parts faster and more efficiently than some of the competition can. So, the team has been working on these initially for many years. And now we\u2019re seeing the real fruits of the investments and the efforts to the team\u2019s put forth. On the TRP side, if you look at same store sales year-over-year, we\u2019re up about 20% on the independent standalone TRP side.","Alex Potter","And what margin impact did that have to the extent TRP ends up being a bigger or smaller percentage of mix?","Ron Armstrong","It would probably pull the overall average down just a bit, because it\u2019s typically all -- makes parts for the all brands of vehicles. ","Alex Potter","Okay. Very good. And then I guess one last question on used truck pricing. There is some thought I suppose that used truck prices could eventually start trending lower as we get lower towards the back half of the year. Just wondering, if you\u2019re starting to see any of that or if you agree with that being the thing.","Ron Armstrong","I think, again, we\u2019ve seen a positive trending in the last three to six months on the used truck pricing. And so, we\u2019re seeing just the opposite. We\u2019re seeing the positive trends.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Ann Duignan","Good morning or afternoon whatever. My first question may be around, if you could speak to what you\u2019re seeing out there by segment. We\u2019re seeing Class 8 sleeper orders up about 140%, day cab is up about 112% and straight truck is up about 43%. Just curious what you guys are seeing there by mix application or segment in terms of your backlog or your orders?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think we\u2019re seeing increases in all those segments sort of across the board. I wouldn\u2019t say there is any particular segment that\u2019s outperforming the other, probably a little bit higher sleeper mix just because of the demand for on highway trucks.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And it does look like the sleepers started to accelerate into end of the last year. Is that the case?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think more of the on-highway fleets will place their orders in the late fourth quarter, early first part of the year. So, I think we\u2019re just seeing the effects of the timing of when they place their orders.","Ann Duignan","And given your backlog year-to-date, do you have enough capacity to meet demand for this year or do you envision maybe having pushback some of those deliveries into next year? And do you think there is any risk that we see production expand into or extend into 2019, just on back of capacity constrains?","Ron Armstrong","Well, demand is good. And we see no indications that demand is lessening. So, we\u2019re going to build the trucks that we can build and we have the capacity to be able to support our customers\u2019 needs.","Ann Duignan","Okay. And then, just quickly as a final follow-up. Could you just discuss input cost versus pricing power, and what\u2019s the pricing environment like out there, given the strength in orders and demand?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. We\u2019ve seen some moderate ability to increase prices, particularly on smaller truck orders. But, we\u2019re also seeing some moderate increases in the input costs, and we continue to see commodity costs trend upward. But, again, our long-term agreements facilitate that being smooth over time and we\u2019re able to realize that as a marketplace for the most part.","Ann Duignan","So, you wouldn\u2019t expect the mix to be negative this year or is that am I raising into it or\u2026","Ron Armstrong","No, I don\u2019t -- at this point, we don\u2019t see that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Jerry Revich","I\u2019m wondering, if you could talk about your expectations of vehicle mix in the second quarter. In the first quarter, you spoke about getting a tailwind from a mix of business. I\u2019m wondering how do you expect that to evolve into 2Q. And you have spoken about gross margin expectations for the year. I\u2019m wondering if you could touch on the second quarter specifically.","Ron Armstrong","Yes. So, we talked about our second quarter overall gross margins being in the mid 14% levels, and we will see an increased mix of deliveries to fleet customers in the second quarter. But, that\u2019s all very normal. And so, we expect another strong margin quarter as we mentioned.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And in terms of factory overhead costs, those took a leg higher to support the higher production levels in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about how that trended into the first quarter and what expectations are over the balance of the year?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. The factory overhead and all of our other costs trended exactly as we expect with higher volume and we\u2019re seeing the benefits of the operating leverage. We see that in the 14.8% margin for the quarter.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And last year because of your dealers hit their threshold for part sales, we saw I think in the third quarter, the weaker pricing than we would otherwise expect. Anything that we need to keep in mind in terms of rebates as we think about this year compared to the way last year played out?","Ron Armstrong","You saw the great results that we had in the first quarter with 19% increase. So, we are expecting our dealers, and dealers are doing very well. And so, we\u2019re providing the support for those incentives as we go.","Jerry Revich","Okay. So, it won\u2019t be as lumpy as we saw last year?","Ron Armstrong","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open. ","Joel Tiss","So, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about any supplier constrains and kind of just what\u2019s happening along the chain on the way to your factories for the different parts.","Ron Armstrong","Yes. Our truck divisions and materials teams, our purchasing groups have done a great job of really coordinating well with our suppliers on our build plans. As we mentioned, we\u2019re planning to increase our build rates in the second quarter. And so, it\u2019s a very coordinated approach with our supply base to make sure that we can execute that. We don\u2019t take the build rates up unless we feel confident in their ability to deliver. And so, we\u2019re working very closely with them as we always do. But, so far, it\u2019s been excellent in terms of the support.","Joel Tiss","And then, is there any commentary or any color you can give us around cancellation rates, maybe even just size it up for the whole industry, and the ability for or the whatever -- your feeling about keeping production strong through 2019, just kind of the way the market feels to you? I\u2019m not asking for the forecast.","Ron Armstrong","Sure. The cancellation rates are very low, Joel, just to have the occasional cancellations and reorder, but that\u2019s pretty uncommon at this point. And so, in terms of the customer demands in Europe and in North America, it\u2019s really strong. The economies are all trending positively. So, I don\u2019t see any reason why the demand can\u2019t be good for the foreseeable future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Seth Weber","I just wanted to go back to the gross margin point for a second. And correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I think you said mid 14% for the second quarter this year. And you guys did about the same last year on much lower revenue. So, I\u2019m just trying to -- am I -- I\u2019m just trying to understand why the margins isn\u2019t increasing year-over-year with the higher revenue.","Ron Armstrong","That\u2019s -- we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve got a lot, like I said, higher mix of fleet deliveries in the second quarter and that\u2019s\u2026","Harrie Schippers","[Indiscernible]","Ron Armstrong","Yes. That\u2019s a good point. If you look at the mix of trucks, we\u2019re going to be up -- we\u2019re up 30 plus percent on trucks in the first quarter, and the same will be true in the second quarter. And the incremental margin on trucks just isn\u2019t as great as it is on the parts. So, that proportion as a dampening effect of the overall margin.","Seth Weber","That\u2019s -- I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re talking year-over-year or foreseeable fourth quarter?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, year-over-year, year-over-year. Yes.","Seth Weber","Right. Okay. So, it\u2019s a mix issue. Even though the parts business is growing quickly, the trucks are growing more rapidly.","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Seth Weber","Right. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, just on the Brazil investment that you called out in the press release, is there any color around that? And I guess, can you talk about what you\u2019re doing with that investment and kind of how you feel like your distribution is set up in that market at this point?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. So, our distribution, we\u2019ve had presence in the Andean region in South America for decades. And we introduced the DAF truck models into that region five years ago and continue to see the DAF models increase their penetration in the Andean region of South America. And we continue to invest in products for that part of the business. And of course Brazil, we introduced a heavy application, off highway application late last year at the Fenatran Truck Show and that truck is now entering the production and should help support our dealers and our customers with an addition of expanded product line in Brazil. The team there is doing a great job, the product is very well received, and our distribution network continues to expand as we progress and build out our truck line as well as distribution capabilities for the country. ","Operator","Your next question comes from David from Baird. Your line is open.","Joe Vruwink","Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David. ","Ron Armstrong","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Vruwink","I might have miss this, so I apologize. But I think gross margins in Q1 finished above the guide you provided a quarter ago. What exactly drove the upside and profitability?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think, given that the first quarter we had a favorable customer mix in terms of deliveries to dealers for stocking purposes as well as smaller fleet, and we\u2019ll see more larger fleets in the second quarter. And the parts business -- rate activity with respect to proprietary parts in the first quarter.","Joe Vruwink","Okay. That makes sense. If I can shift gears, the 40% increase in orders for DAF, that\u2019s a pretty big gain, particularly it seems like some of your competitors in Europe are seeing decelerating order activity. Any more color on why DAF would be performing at such a wide variance to what maybe some of the other OEMs are seeing?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I got a few thoughts; I\u2019m sure Harrie will have a few. But, the key thing is a great products. I mean, the CF\/XF was named International Truck of the Year, provides a 7% better fuel efficiency. And so, I think the customers appreciate that. And they\u2019re seeking to take advantage of the great products that DAF is offering. Harrie, do you anything to add? ","Harrie Schippers","I can only echo that, Ron. The end result is that we\u2019ve nicely grown market share in the first quarter. And it\u2019s not only in registration, the share, we see that in order intake to that. More customers, more fleets are choosing for the DAF International Truck of the Year.","Joe Vruwink","And then, I know what I\u2019m about to ask is a bit of convoluted calculation. But, if I think about your presence in Europe, obviously great positioning in the UK. The UK market has started to soften. So, to do this type of market share in Europe, I have to imagine that you\u2019re reaching new all-time record levels of share in a lot of individual countries. Is that a fair characterization. ","Ron Armstrong","Yes, at or near record high levels in a lot of markets. So, yes, the trucks are performing well and it\u2019s well recognized across Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","I\u2019m wondering, Ron, as we sort of stretch out the backlog here, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of new truck pricing? Is there an opportunity to get a little bit more as the backlog stretches out?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. It\u2019s typically, it\u2019s supply and demand business. And yes, there is definitely an opportunity. And it\u2019s also moderate pricing gains in the first quarter.","Steve Volkmann","But, again, given sort of the length of the backlog, I\u2019m supposing that probably wouldn\u2019t really show up until the second half of the year in terms of maybe seeing it in your numbers or maybe the margins, slightly better or just how would we think of that timing?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think, you\u2019ll see it gradually progressed as we progress through the year.","Steve Volkmann","Okay, thanks. And then, I\u2019m curious, if you have any kind of initial, just big picture thoughts on the cycle relative to what 2019 might look like. And we\u2019ve obviously had lots of cycles that have been heavily impacted by emission changes or they have at this time. What\u2019s your view, is \u201819 reasonably assumed to be sort of flattish or does it need to be down just because we\u2019re having a big year this year? How do you just look at the longer term?","Ron Armstrong","We\u2019re going to continue to build trucks for customers. And we\u2019ve seen no signs of lessening in demand. So, as the year progresses, we\u2019ll get a better feel for 2019. But our assessment is that as long as the economy is good that the truck markets will be good.","Steve Volkmann","And do you have already some of your build slots in \u201819, spoken for?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, for sure. Customers -- there is larger fleet customers often times will place orders for multi-year. So, yes, there is a nice base line, if you will, of business that\u2019s been booked for 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. ","Andy Casey","Thanks a lot. And how are you guys doing?","Ron Armstrong","Great. And you, Andy?","Andy Casey","I\u2019m doing fine. Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Has the snow ended?","Andy Casey","I think so. Fingers crossed. I don\u2019t think you addressed this. But, could you just help us understand the currency impact on revenue and EBIT margin? I\u2019m just wondering what that -- how that may have impacted the overall incremental margin performance?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I\u2019ll let Michael address that.","Michael Barkley","Yes. The impact on currency compared to prior year on revenues is about $240 million of increase and that\u2019s mostly due to the euro appreciated against the dollar. And the impact on pre-tax income was about $19 million positive. ","Andy Casey","Okay. Thank you. That explains some of it. And then, kind of going back to the pricing question that Steve asked just a bit ago. Can you discuss how you approach balancing price up versus market share, specifically in the U.S. and Canadian market? Your European orders are quite strong obviously.","Ron Armstrong","Well, it\u2019s the same every day. I mean it\u2019s a competitive marketplace. And everybody is quoting customers. And so you have multiple people buying for business. And we obviously continue to earn a premium on our products relative to the competition. But, customers are willing to pay extra for the lower total operating costs, the higher residual values, but there is a limit to that. And so, we focus on the value of our products and we don\u2019t compete on price necessarily.","Andy Casey","Sure. It\u2019s just the reason for the question, Ron as it just seems like some of your competitors appear to have constraints that are limiting their ability to satisfy additional orders in 2018, a couple of them to be specific. But, I\u2019m just wondering since you have incremental capacity that you could service orders that may have some more immediacy than waiting until let\u2019s say the first part of next year for delivery. Does that offer pricing opportunity or is it\u2026","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I mean, it\u2019s going to be moderate, Andy, I think in terms of the overall effect on margins. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","I just wanted to ask you about your warranty experience. I think, you\u2019ve been running better than some accrual rates on certain products. I\u2019m not sure if that was the MX-11. Just wondering if that\u2019s continued. And if so, is there a certain point at which you reassess that accrual rate that could come in and support margins?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. We reassess accrual rates every quarter. And so, it\u2019s closely watched by Michael and his team and the operating folks. And so, our warranty expense really reflects our best assessment of what\u2019s going on in the field. At any point in time as you transition to new models, you\u2019ll provide a little bit of extra warranty in the early days, but our experience is that that will rapidly come down, because the products are better. And so, we see the ebbs and flows of new models and in maturity of new model et cetera over time. ","Steven Fisher","Is that something that could be a second half tailwind for this year?","Ron Armstrong","We\u2019ll evaluate it every quarter. So, we\u2019re reflecting our best estimates every quarter along the way.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And you mentioned that there is some modest pricing available with smaller orders. So, when do you think production might be tight enough in the industry to see that higher pricing more broadly? I\u2019m not sure if there is a certain level of industry production or retail sales that you\u2019re thinking about that might be more supportive of a broad-based pricing improvement. But I guess, I\u2019ll ask it in those terms.","Ron Armstrong","I think, again, it\u2019s a competitive environment. So, you always balance pricing opportunity with your ability to earn the share that you think you should earn. So, it\u2019s an ongoing balancing of those two factors.","Steven Fisher","So, when do you think you might get an indication of pricing initially for 2019, typically would be in your fourth quarter? Others have said, perhaps you it could happen earlier than that this year. Is that the way you\u2019re thinking about it?","Ron Armstrong","Again, pricing is sort of an ongoing daily assessment of how the market is trending. And so, we\u2019ll see -- we\u2019ll just make those calls as we progress throughout this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good afternoon. I guess, just two quick follow-ups. In case, if I missed it, did you talk about what your gross margin assumption was for the year? I know, you gave it sort for the second quarter. And then, last, you\u2019ve raised your R&D again. Is this the new run rate in terms of how we should think about R&D, given just required investment, NAV and alternative technologies?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. So, for margins, I think that mid-14% level for the year is probably a pretty good proxy for what we think the average for the year will end up being. And in terms of R&D, yes, I think, the run rate in the first quarter is a good proxy. The first quarter -- we saw about $5 million to $6 million increase in R&D as a result of currency movements. But, the rest of it is focused on new truck models, new engines, including as you mentioned electric hydrogen fuel cell and hybrid vehicles. So, we\u2019re making investments in a lot of fronts, including the advanced driver assisted assistance autonomy and truck... ","Jamie Cook","And sorry that comment was -- my question was more towards beyond 2018. So, that\u2019s for beyond \u201818 as well, right, just long term?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think that\u2019s a good indicator for the run rate. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Courtney Yakavonis","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just curious if you can give us an update on the penetration for your MX engines, and if you\u2019ve updated your long-term goals for that. And then also if there is any difference to what you guys are currently seeing in the quarter versus what\u2019s in your backlog? And then, secondly just any impacts that that might be having on the aftermarket sales that we\u2019re seeing from you guys, especially since we\u2019re starting to be about 5 or 6 years out\u2026","Ron Armstrong","So, we continue to be in the 40% to 45% range. And we would love to see that develop over the coming years. And we think it will as more and more customers realize the benefits of the engine and as we get into greenhouse gas regulations in 2021 and subsequent years, I think the demand for our engines will continue to increase. And yes, we are definitely seeing the benefits of that in the part sales. And we\u2019re now into the seventh year of -- since we started the production of the engine here in North America and the population continues to grow. I think, we\u2019re approaching close to 200,000 MX engines in North America and of course DAF has PACCAR engine in all of its trucks. And so, yes, we\u2019re definitely seeing the benefit on the aftermarket part size, as a result of the engine introduction and continuing growing population.","Courtney Yakavonis","Is there any way to quantify that?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I would say that I don\u2019t know the exact numbers, but the MX engine growth is definitely probably above the overall average for year-on-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","David Raso","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s one given your history you\u2019re going to answer. But, if you can add a little context to the mix issue. I know you\u2019re not going to state blatantly difference in the margin between owner operator sale on a fleet. But, I think we\u2019re all trying to understand where we are in the cycle, but on the margins themselves. If you pull out the currency for the quarter, it\u2019s still say 16% operating incremental margin. I mean, it\u2019s still not great. We\u2019re just trying to think through, if \u201819, the cycle is longer than people thought, and the mix lean back the other way a bit, what kind of impact is that really having on the margins? It wasn\u2019t like last year\u2019s incrementals were that fantastic either with the different mix or it was not a negative of the mix. So, can you at least frame it a little bit for us what the mix implications are and the profitability?","Ron Armstrong","David, I\u2019d just have to disagree with you a little bit. I think the margins are excellent in terms of looking at what we\u2019re providing to our shareholders. And so, as we think about the mix, the mix goes up and down quarter-to-quarter, depending on whether you\u2019re selling a large mix of fleet customers at a point in time. And so, that\u2019s sort of ebbs and flows from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year. And so, we\u2019re -- we feel good about the operating results. We have the best margins, best operating margins in the industry. So, I think, we feel good about where we\u2019re at. ","David Raso","Okay. And then, just so we level set people\u2019s expectations, are these gross margins, these truck volumes something that you\u2019re comfortable with? I mean, should we not expect margins to be viewed internally as we needed to move these higher materially or as someone said earlier, higher revenues, higher unit deliveries? We\u2019re not seeing a lot of gross margin improvement. Just so we understand, I mean maybe it\u2019s proper investments for future growth, technology, pushing in other geographies, just move the cycles out, but I think people keep going back to the well, hoping there is quarter or two the margins can nearly pop and maybe just our fault on the street expecting that to occur?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I think as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, the growth in revenue is particularly strong on the truck side relative to the parts side. And so, at 12% on trucks and 27% on parts, the trucks are accelerating faster that sort of dampens the incremental. And you can -- we delivered 15% to 20% incrementals over time, and that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Shlisky with Seaport Global. Your line is open. ","Michael Shlisky","Hey, guys. So, your share in medium duty has been pretty strong this year so far in North America. Are there any success stories here that kind of caused or any kind of model the end market? And can you give us more broader view on the [indiscernible] market for the year?","Ron Armstrong","Well, on the medium duty side, we think the market will actually be a little bit stronger this year than last year. And of course, last year was a record year for PACCAR for medium duty truck deliveries over 29,000 trucks. And so, based on the strong share and the good market conditions, we have an opportunity, we have an excellent year on the medium duty side. We\u2019ve had some growth in expanding our customer base some significant orders that have come in. And so, we\u2019re excited about the prospects for that vehicle. And we continue to invest in enhancing that vehicle over time.","Michael Shlisky","Okay, great. I also wanted to ask secondly about SG&A, Jamie asked about R&D. It\u2019s little bit higher this year, up 20% plus from the previous year. Is that just because of the top-line increases or is there any higher structural costs we should be aware of for the rest of the year?","Ron Armstrong","So, about $7 million of that increase on SG&A was currency driven, slightly higher professional fees. The first quarter typically has a little bit higher cost related to long-term incentive grants that doesn\u2019t recur for the rest of the year. So those are sort of the key reasons for the increase.","Michael Shlisky","So, perhaps maybe up slightly year-over-year when you net those things out, but it shouldn\u2019t be a huge increase for the rest of the year compared to\u2026 ","Ron Armstrong ","Yes. As we look forward to the next few quarters, I would say, it would be probably slightly lower maybe than first quarter level.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open. ","Rob Wertheimer","I had a quick on the current orders and then a bigger picture one to some electrification. So, on current orders, I mean, the strong ones we\u2019ve seen in the recent months this year, do you have sense your customers want to take delivery of truck right now and OEMs want to pushing that a little bit or are they really seeing a longer duration of cycle and happy to have it 2 or 3 or 4 quarters from now? I\u2019m just curious about the urgency of those orders.","Ron Armstrong","No. I think, the urgency is strong. I think, the customers want their trucks as they\u2019ve put in orders for this year or orders for maybe that extend into 2019. But, they thought about what -- when they want the deliveries. And so, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re definitely looking to get the trucks. The fuel economy of our current vehicles is excellent. And so, they get operating advantage by buying that new truck as well. So definitely, I think there they\u2019re definitely wanting to get the trucks delivery.","Rob Wertheimer","Okay, makes sense. The second question, just if you could give an update on electrification. And we\u2019ve seen some product announcements in recent days and obviously you guys have what you\u2019re working on. I mean, how do you think about the next five years? Is it where you\u2019re trialing solutions and experiments with different suppliers, different platforms, different ideas in the markets 5 and 10 years out or do you think you actually have to be making some real decisions on platforms that will continue and endure. I am really curious about how you approach investing in that and what level of decision do you think you have to make and how fast?","Ron Armstrong","So, we are exploring a lot of different avenues with full electric, hydrogen fuel cell, hybrid. And so, we\u2019ve got a really diversified program. We\u2019ve got trucks that are in the field being tested. And as we look at the truck segment that we participate in, we think the part where the evolvement will be the greatest, will probably be on the medium duty side, the light or heavy side, regional, urban deliveries where they can support the range. The still the issue is the economic viability of electric and fuel cell vehicles, just because the up-charge typical electric trucks is going to be about twice as expensive as a normal diesel vehicle. So, as long as there are subsidies and as long as maybe the regulations dictate, zero emission vehicles in certain zones, in large cities, that\u2019s going to create some demand. But, until it\u2019s economically feasible, there won\u2019t be wide-spread demand. So, that could be five plus years.","Rob Wertheimer","Perfect. And that five plus years applies to even like the medium duty and the in town Class 8s, I mean obviously long hauls, long way out, but\u2026","Ron Armstrong","It applies to all, because again the economic feasibility has got to make sense for the customer. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Salmon with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. ","Rob Salmon","You\u2019ve taken up the parts revenue outlook the past few quarters. And I guess, piggybacking on an earlier question about kind of MX engines. Can you give us a sense of how we should think about the revenue growth opportunity longer term in parts?","Ron Armstrong","If you look at the last 15 years of our parts revenue development, it\u2019s averaged an 8% average annual growth over that period. And I think with the engines, I don\u2019t see any reason that we\u2019ll see a significant deviation. Again, the team has done a great job. We continue to make strategic investments in new distribution capability, continue to invest in technology in those distribution centers to be able to have the best parts of availability and on-time delivery for our customers. The programs the team has put together continue to be enhanced. And so, I think, we\u2019ll continue to see that pace of growth I think as we look into the future.","Rob Salmon","That\u2019s helpful. And I\u2019m kind of thinking about your factory utilization, you\u2019ve obviously brought up production rates more recently. Can you give us a sense of where you are on kind of the number of shifts where that can go to before you see potential constraints in terms of PACCAR hitting its customer needs?","Ron Armstrong","Well, we have assembly capacity that can go well beyond, but obviously it\u2019s -- as I said before, it\u2019s a very coordinated effort that is required with our suppliers, to make sure that we\u2019ve got all the components to be able to support the trucks. And our teams have done a great job of delivering on that. So, it just has to develop over time, as we worked with our supply base and our teams to make sure that works, doing it cost effectively and efficiently.","Rob Salmon","Of course. And I guess, if I\u2019m thinking about your answer, how much flexibility do you have with your supplier base to increase further from where the build plan is going for 2018?","Ron Armstrong","We always seem to be able to find a way to get that next incremental truck. So, I don\u2019t think there is a limit on what we can do. It just takes gradual progression over time.","Rob Salmon","Of course. And if I can squeeze one more in. From your customer base, how many of orders are coming in without a trade, i.e. kind of net fleet growth, particularly in the kind of the smaller owner operator and kind of medium sized fleets you guys interact with?","Ron Armstrong","The vast majority would come in without a trade. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mario Gabelli with GAMCO Investors. Your line is open.","Mario Gabelli","Thanks. I\u2019m just trying to figure out this -- you may have mentioned back in February. But, 100% write off used equipment, what\u2019s happened to the used truck fleet in light of the ability to deduct 100%. And then, the same thing with regards to your dealers preordering, you kind of tick and tie the two together? And then, I\u2019m going to assume that what happens in November after the election at 100% write off is eliminated. Do you get a surge in orders for equipment, but you can\u2019t handle it?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I think, the demand for orders has largely been driven by the economics, the demand for freight by shippers to get freights, get goods delivered. Obviously, the 100% deductibility of equipment costs is definitely a positive for customers, both new and used. And we have seen some uptick in the demand for used trucks as well as the pricing for used trucks, and how you attribute that to the tax change or other things, but it\u2019s one of the factors I\u2019m sure... ","Mario Gabelli","Thank you. And now for the easy one. Navistar -- Volkswagen has taken their company public, they\u2019ll be buying Navistar at some point. There is some discussions that Marchionne is going to be leaving and retiring, and he wants to merge IVECO with someone, the only logical player is DAF, which on any of these will you comment on, let\u2019s start with the easy one. Navistar, Volkswagen, any particular changes in distribution as a result?","Ron Armstrong","No, we\u2019ve expected that to be there for\u2026","Mario Gabelli","Sometime, yes, I know. Listen I was just on a rush call. So, I\u2019ll listen to what Rusty says about life and liberty. Thanks very much. Look forward to seeing you again. ","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Your last question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Steve Volkmann","Hey, thanks. I snuck one in. I was just curious how you guys are thinking about cash these days. You have like $3.5 billion. I know you like to have cash on the balance sheet. But I\u2019m assuming you have little more flexibility post the tax changes et cetera. And then, curious if you have any thoughts relative to share repurchases, or do you prefer to just kind of put it into the dividend at year-end, or just any guidelines about how you think about that?","Ron Armstrong","Yes. I mean, if you look at our cash balance relative to our asset base, it\u2019s stayed in the 15% to 20% range over quite some time. And that\u2019s about where it\u2019s at currently. So, we\u2019re quite comfortable with where we\u2019re at. And obviously, the tax law provides some additional benefits that the Board will take a look and evaluate as they always do, the opportunity to repurchase shares and pay dividends. So, that\u2019s an ongoing capital allocation assessments; it\u2019s discussed at the Board meeting.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the Company?","Ron Armstrong","We\u2019d like to thank everyone for participating. And thank you, operator.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And if anyone has any objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported excellent revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2015. PACCAR\u2019s first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.8 billion. And quarterly net income was $378 million and after tax return on revenues of 7.8%. Net income increased 38% compared to the results generated in the first quarter last year.","I\u2019m very proud of our 23,000 employees who have delivered industry leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","The first quarter marked another major milestone for PACCAR with DAF celebrating its 1 millionth truck delivery. I\u2019m very proud of the thousands of DAF and Leyland employees over the years who contributed to this achievement. PACCAR delivered 38,300 trucks during the first quarter, a 20% increase versus the first quarter last year, slightly ahead of our expectations. The improvement reflects increased truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada due to a good economy, record freight demand and expansion of fleet capacity. Deliveries in Europe were 10% higher than last year\u2019s first quarter.","Looking ahead, we expect to increase truck deliveries in the second quarter by 5% to 7% compared to the first quarter reflecting higher production rates for medium and heavy duty trucks in North America and Europe. Second quarter gross margins are projected to be slightly higher than the first quarter reflecting the benefits of increased production levels and improved operating efficiencies.","Europe\u2019s economic outlook has been helped recently by the European Central Bank\u2019s quantitative easing program and lower oil prices. GDP growth expectations for this year are 2.6% in the UK which is PACCAR\u2019s strongest market in the region, and 1.3% on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways in March was up 4% over last year and at the highest first quarter level since the German toll system was launched in 2007. We have raised our forecast for Europe\u2019s greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 220,000 units to 250,000 units reflecting a rebound in orders and the brighter economic outlook.","Year-to-date, DAF has achieved a 15.5% share of the heavy truck market. I want to comment on the effects the translation had on our revenues during the first quarter of this year. Looking at truck and other revenue, revenues were impacted by $232 million. Looking at parts, parts was impacted by $49 million for a total impact on revenues of $281 million. The impact on financial services was a reduction of $16 million.","On profit, the effects of translation were largely offset by a natural hedge that we have with respect to the purchase of engine components for our engines that we manufacture in North America. ","Turning to the U.S., the economic picture in the U.S. remains positive with GDP forecast to grow 2.9% this year. The housing and automotive industries create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 14% this year to over 1.1 million. And the automotive industry is expected to deliver 16.8 million vehicles near record levels.","We estimate U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales will be in a range of 260,000 units to 290,000 units this year, up from 250,000 units in 2014. The stronger market reflects expansion in industry fleet capacity due to continued strong freight fundamentals. Industry truck orders for the U.S. and Canada in each of the last two quarters were the highest since 2006. Peterbilt and Kenworth\u2019s combined share of the U.S. and Canadian market is over 27% year-to-date.","PACCAR\u2019s parts business generated quarterly revenues of $753 million, a 4% increase compared to $727 million in the same quarter of last year. PACCAR parts quarterly pretax income was $139 million, an increase of 24% compared to the $112 million earned in the first quarter of 2014. The strong results were driven by high fleet utilization, growth in the size of the North American truck parc, and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR parts and our dealers.","PACCAR Financial Services first quarter pretax income was $89 million compared to $86 million earned a year ago with profits, which resulted from growth and asset balances and excellent portfolio performance.","PACCAR strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $3.1 billion in new products and facilities in the last five years. We\u2019re delighted that the new Kenworth T880 truck powered by the PACCAR MX-13 engine was honored as the 2015 Commercial Truck of the Year by the American Truck Dealers. PAACAR\u2019s capital spending of $325 million to $375 million this year is targeted at enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency of our assembly and distribution facilities.","Research and development expenses are estimated to be in a range of $225 million to $250 million. PAACAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry.","Thank you. I\u2019d be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew Casey","Thank you. Good morning, everybody.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Casey","Just a quick question Ron on whether you guys have seen any improvement in the outlook for pricing whether it would be Q2 or second-half specifically in North America?","Ronald Armstrong","I just say pricing is very stable. Customers recognize the value of the Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF products around the world. Markets are always competitive and we have a great product to offer. And so I think that the pricing at this point is very stable.","Andrew Casey","Okay, thanks. And then the comment about the 5% to 7% sequential production increase. Is part of that more days in the quarter, or are you able specifically in North America to increase production by utilizing some of your other production sites as opposed to the two primary ones for Class 8?","Ronald Armstrong","I would say, most of it is higher daily production rates with maybe a day or two extra.","Andrew Casey","Okay. Thank you very much.","Ronald Armstrong","Sure.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you. Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So incremental margin appear to take a meaningful jump this quarter and gross margin was well ahead of your previous guidance of 100 basis points to 150 basis points of year-over-year improvement. So can you talk about what ended up being better than your expectations? It does look like some of that is strong parts margin, and maybe your distribution center is ramping up there significantly, I don\u2019t know or are you starting to get better absorption and pricing in Europe?","Ronald Armstrong","I think your observation about parts is right on point, several things there. One was favorable mix of the products that were sold, the operating leverage of our cost structure, and we did see some benefits from the lower oil price and the effect on our delivery costs from our parts business. So those factors played a role, and then just the - a more stable build rate in the operating efficiencies that come with operating at a stable level.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, that\u2019s good. And then Ron, you said the gross margin would be about 50 basis points better for the year, but after being better than expectations in 1Q, what could that margin improvement look like for the year?","Ronald Armstrong","I would think that for the year we look at something that would be comparable to first quarter levels.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","Hi, good morning guys.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Ann.","Ann Duignan","Good morning. Can you comment on your - what you mentioned about some fleet expansion out there, whether that\u2019s part of a trend you are beginning to see, we hear a lot about driver shortage, et cetera, et cetera. And then comment on if we continue to see some fleet expansion, could that have a negative impact on your parts business as we go forward, more new trucks, fewer parts and services?","Ronald Armstrong","I think the parts business is well positioned. The trucks that are there are operating at over 90% utilization, which is really a peak level. So I don\u2019t see any tapering off from whether it\u2019s that those are new trucks or older trucks. I think the parts business will continue to benefit from strong freight markets not only in North America, but also in Europe. And I think, the fleets, there was some pent-up demand over the more challenging years more and more fleets are renewing their fleets, and also I think if they had additional drivers they would probably purchase additional trucks. But we\u2019ve seen some fleets be able to make those expansion, so.","Ann Duignan","Okay, thank you. And then just if you could comment on the rise in cancellations last month, I know it was an industry number. But are you seeing anything out there on the cancellation side that caused you any concern as we go through the year, [indiscernible] oil and gas or anything?","Ronald Armstrong","No, no concerns at all.","Ann Duignan","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Jerry, your line is open. Please proceed with your question.","Jerry Revich","Good morning. Sorry about that. I\u2019m wondering if you gentlemen can talk about the book to bill in the quarter in Europe? One of your competitors spoke about a 40% year-over-year increase in orders in the quarter. Are you seeing as much momentum as they are? Can you just calibrate us there?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So as we look at DAF\u2019s orders in the first quarter compared to fourth quarter levels, we\u2019re also up about 40%.","Jerry Revich","And in terms of in the PACCAR financial business, you continue at pretty good margin performance there. Can you just talk about how we should think about the debt to equity ratio for that business? You\u2019ve taken it down about a turn over the past year, plus can you just talk about what\u2019s driving the more conservative balance sheet there and how we should think about the ratio longer term?","Ronald Armstrong","I think we\u2019ve just been able to - we\u2019ve retained the earnings that we\u2019ve achieved over the last many years and retained those in the business. So more of our portfolio is being funded with the equity, but I would see the leverage would continue at similar levels to where we\u2019re at currently in the foreseeable future.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then can you update us on your push on the operating lease side? What\u2019s your penetration look like? Is that still a meaningful priority for you folks in that business?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. I mean we have a full line of products that PACCAR Financial Services offer. So we\u2019re very willing to provide loans, leases, floor plan financing, all the products that we offer to all of our customers and our dealers. And we\u2019re not preferential to anyone particular product; we just want to meet our customer\u2019s needs and support the growth of those that sell PACCAR trucks.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of JB Groh with D.A. Davidson.","JB Groh","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of housekeeping issues on the SG&A that - year-over-year that pretty nice decrease there. Is there something that was happening last year that caused that to be a little higher, is this roughly $110 million a good run rate for the remainder of the year should that go up a little bit?","Ronald Armstrong","The SG&A did benefit about $10 million from exchange effects.","JB Groh","Okay.","Ronald Armstrong","And the current exchange rate, this is a fairly good run rate.","JB Groh","Okay. And I know you can\u2019t give us any details on this European Commission in terms of the potential impact, but how about timing? Any idea when there will be some sort of\u2026?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. We\u2019ve got - provided the update in our press release. We really have nothing else to add at this point, JB.","JB Groh","Okay, that\u2019s fair. And then how about an update on South America? How are things going there?","Ronald Armstrong","Things are going very well. Our factory continues to build excellent trucks for the Brazilian market. More and more dealers are opening their new facilities, continue to construct new facilities. We\u2019re still identifying dealers in some areas of expansion, so it\u2019s all progressing very well and as we look at the long-term that will be an excellent investment for us.","JB Groh","But is the rate that you are currently delivering there, is that probably a little bit of a drag on the margin?","Ronald Armstrong","Our deliveries are very steady, so it\u2019s been at the same rate for the last several quarters.","JB Groh","Okay. And then did you get, I didn\u2019t - I don\u2019t know if I got this, do you give the delivery numbers?","Ronald Armstrong","By region or - a total of 38,300 trucks in the first quarter.","JB Groh","Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with Bank of Montreal.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Joel.","Joel Tiss","Hey, how it\u2019s going?","Ronald Armstrong","Great.","Joel Tiss","That was a beautiful quarter.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Joel Tiss","Is your European share gain, do you think that\u2019s going to continue, or do you think the growth for the foreseeable future is going to be more or less in line with the market growth?","Ronald Armstrong","I think our growth will be in line with market. And if you look over the last 15 years, we\u2019ve sort of gone from less than 10% to up to 16% last year being a little bit of an anomaly with the Euro 5 noise in the market. So, I think the 15.5% is about where we expect to see the year and hopefully, we\u2019ll continue to grow and build on that base, as we go forward in the years to come.","Joel Tiss","Are we going to see any tax rate benefit from the mix shift, maybe a little more Europe coming in the future?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, there could be tenths of a point, but it\u2019s not going to be significant.","Joel Tiss","It won\u2019t be meaningful.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes.","Joel Tiss","Great. Thank you so much.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you, Joel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning.","Steven Fisher","I\u2019m not sure if this is what you\u2019re exactly answering Andy Kaplowitz before. But how sustainable do you think this level of parts margin is? And what were the biggest contributors to the mix in there that you mentioned?","Ronald Armstrong","The mix is primarily just a higher mix of proprietary and PACCAR brand and product compared to maybe all mix versus vendor product line. So that\u2019s the mix side of that. And 4%, we expect the year to be somewhere in the 2% to 5% range at current exchange rates.","Steven Fisher","Okay. But the 18.5% margin that you did in the parts business is the sustainability of that?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think we see that the parts margins as we go forward in the succeeding quarters would be comparable to first quarter level.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then can you just talk about the cadence, the free cash flow over the balance of the year, and I think the CapEx you might be ramping up from the $55 million in the first quarter, but would you see some offset there to get your free cash flow posted your net income level?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think we will see an acceleration of capital spending, as we progress through the year, but won\u2019t be dramatic. And so, yeah, we continue to generate strong operating cash flow and we\u2019ll see a pretty normal, as we progress through the rest of this year.","Steven Fisher","Okay. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein with Citigroup.","Timothy Thein","Great. Thank you. Good morning.","Ronald Armstrong","Hi, Tim.","Timothy Thein","Ron, the first one is just on actually two on Europe. As you - as we kind of exit 2015 based on the way that you expect the market to play out, where would you think whoever you expect to be in terms of that spread between the average truck price in Europe relative to the higher Euro 6 content, i.e., does that that headwind that you faced in 2014, does that go away, or still not - volume is not high enough to be able to offset the full amount?","Ronald Armstrong","Tim, I think it really depends on the strength of the market and the competitive nature of the market. And it\u2019s just, it\u2019s early days. We have seen some very positive signs in the last couple of months in terms of order intake activity in Europe, but we\u2019ll see how things progress. So it will be dependent on level of market demand at that point.","Timothy Thein","Okay. And then just again sticking in Europe, did you take your, or did you adjust your parts in a constant currency - on a constant currency basis? Did you adjust your full-year parts sales expectations in Europe on the back of the better freight environment that you mentioned?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. So I mean, we expect that parts will grow in Europe during the course of this year, because the effects of currency, parts revenue growth consolidate will be somewhere probably in the 2% to 5% range for the year and 4% for the first quarter.","Timothy Thein","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Nicole DeBlase","So my question is around pricing in Europe. I think that this has alluded a little bit earlier in the call. But can you discuss what you\u2019re seeing? Are you seeing competitors get a bit more aggressive with pricing since volume is starting to pick up there?","Ronald Armstrong","No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t see aggressiveness in pricing, and we see pretty consistent pricing with what we\u2019ve been seeing. And the level of market demand will sort of dictate how things will progress in the pricing side, or progress through the rest of this year. So right now, I would say, it\u2019s pretty steady.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. And then just going back to the oil and gas issue, we talked about this on the last call, but I\u2019m just curious if you heard any changes, any oil and gas customers that are cutting back on their spend for the year. Anything anecdotally you\u2019ve heard there?","Ronald Armstrong","No there is nothing significant what we talked about before. I think oil and gas - for oil and gas exploration and production related items, we\u2019ll probably be lower this year, but that\u2019s offset by other things other segments of the market. So I think it will be a pretty nominal impact.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, thanks. Well, I pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Stephen Volkmann","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of quick clarification, as you said the production of 5% to 7% sequentially, which will be up more, U.S. or Europe?","Ronald Armstrong","It\u2019s going to be pretty even across the Board in terms of Europe and North America.","Stephen Volkmann","Okay, thanks for that. And then I\u2019m just curious about just your view and I\u2019ll take opinion here rather than fact, if you like, but I\u2019m curious what you think of the North American cycle, obviously there\u2019s a lot of debate there. We do see a little bit weaker Class 8 order number recently and then and alluded to the cancellations thing up a little bit. Is that your view that this is kind of a peak of a cycle, or do you think there\u2019s enough demand drivers whatever you might want to list that that could keep this cycle going sort of a couple more years?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, the economy is good. And as long as the economy continues at good growth pace, I think there will be the need for the movement of goods and that will create demand for freight, and the freight numbers continue to be at or near record levels. So I think as long as that continues and trucks are operating at 90% plus utilization that we\u2019ll see a reasonably good demand for trucks in the foreseeable future.","Stephen Volkmann","Thanks very much.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a nice quarter.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Jamie Cook","I guess just two questions. One, can you talk about your markets, your opportunity in the U.S. for the sort of back half of the, or I guess, the remaining eight months of the year. One of your peers is out of capacity, your other peer, people are reluctant to buy truck from. So should we, I mean, is it a - do you think as we look at 2015, PACCAR\u2019s ability to gain share is probably above what you know it is historically just because of the dynamic of the market?","My second question, can you sort of talk about what\u2019s your lead times are? And then I guess, the other question is just given the - I guess, your approach to managing this cycle, would you rather extend your backlogs at some point you get some visibility into latter half of the year into 2016, or take production up and gain share? Thanks.","Ronald Armstrong","Okay. So from a market share standpoint, obviously we\u2019re very focused on growing the profitable market share that we can achieve in the market. And we have great products full lineup with the combination of the 2.1 meter cab, the other products that we offer in the - on highway, off-highway. So we have a great product lineup and we\u2019re looking to grow our share and continue to move that forward.","Lead times are very normal. Customers can get a truck within a reasonable window of time. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with where we\u2019re at lead times and you have good prospects backlog for the second-half of the year. And then going into 2016, we\u2019re - that we\u2019re very vigilant in monitoring orders. Orders come from customers. When they need a truck, we\u2019ll slot it in the backlog, and so we built based on the orders that we have. And so that\u2019s been our approach for 110 years, and that will continue to be our approach as we go forward.","Jamie Cook","I guess, just one follow-up question, the margin performance and the incremental margins in the quarter were obviously they exceeded my expectations. You guys did a great job. I mean, historically, you play down your ability to achieve sort of prior peak margins. I mean, did this quarter surprise you? How do you think about your ability to get back to prior peak based on the performance you had this quarter and just the overall strength you\u2019re seeing in sort of the US and Europe?","Ronald Armstrong","So the prior peak obviously benefited from a very extended backlogs both in North America and Europe. The markets today are still - if you look at Europe, they\u2019re probably 20% to 25% below what they were in 2006-2007 timeframe and here in the North America they\u2019re 10% to 15% below those levels. So yes, we still haven\u2019t gotten to those kinds of levels and so margins are excellent and the operational efficiency that we\u2019re able to achieve with our factories has been outstanding and the stability of our build rates is serving us well.","So we\u2019ll continue to focus on, continue to move the needle forward and achieving the best operating margins that we can for our shareholders.","Jamie Cook","Alrighty, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC.","Emily Mclaughlin","Good morning. This is Emily Mclaughlin on for Seth. Just a couple of questions, given your production guidance for 2Q, can you comment on the growth mix by heavy-duty versus medium-duty within the regions?","Ronald Armstrong","I think it will be similar. We\u2019ll see growth in both the medium-duty and heavy-duty in the quarter probably of comparable amounts.","Emily Mclaughlin","Okay. And then with build rates ticking up as the supply chain continues to meet OEM needs are there any bottlenecks there at this point?","Ronald Armstrong","Supply chain has done just a marvelous job of supporting the ramp-up activities. And the first quarter was very smooth and so the supply base I think is well-positioned to support the industry at this and even potentially higher levels.","Emily Mclaughlin","Okay. And then one more if I may. Can you just speak to what\u2019s going on in the individual countries in Europe, what you\u2019re expecting for the rest of the year there?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, I mean, the UK is our largest market and mentioned in my comments the GDP growth in the UK is very good. And just had the NEC show in Birmingham last week, where DAF was well represented and lots of positive feedback from customers in the UK. We talked about Germany where the trade activity in Germany in the month of March was at the highest level since they have been tracking the mouth [ph] toll statistics, so German freight activity is good. Some of the southern countries Spain and Italy, they really had a very challenging situation with the crisis and in the ensuing couple years but we\u2019re starting to see some rebounds between Italy, Spain and Portugal.","So that\u2019s moving forward as well. So the mood in Europe is generally positive as it\u2019s been in a couple years.","Emily Mclaughlin","That\u2019s great. Thanks very much.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Leiker with Robert W. Baird.","Joseph Vruwink","Hi, good afternoon. This is Joe Vruwink for David.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Joe.","Joseph Vruwink","When you see high-end brands like Scania and DAF gaining market share at the high-end of the market, what\u2019s your general interpretation of that sort of trend going on in Europe, particularly in the sense that normally if you see the premium brands gaining share, that\u2019s a pretty good indication of kind of underlying health in the marketplace?","Ronald Armstrong","I think it\u2019s a focus on value and in operating efficiency. And DAF really focuses on lowest total operating cost providing a great fuel-efficiency with the PACCAR MX engines, both the MX-11 and the MX-13. The Euro 6 products have performed excellently in the market. So now that we\u2019re past the Euro 5 transition period, the DAF products are standing tall in the market and very well received by our customers from a value and operational efficiency perspective.","Joseph Vruwink","So there was a question earlier on pricing competition that may or may not be occurring in Europe. Just from your vantage point it may very well be occurring but the customers you\u2019re targeting probably aren\u2019t forcing that issue with you.","Ronald Armstrong","No, it\u2019s a very competitive market. And it\u2019s still at 220,000 to 250,000 trucks. It\u2019s still 30% below the peak level. So there\u2019s a lot of competition to gain customers. But our products and our services stand tall in the marketplace.","Joseph Vruwink","And then one last one, I missed the comment earlier on the strength and parts margins. Are we finally beginning to see more of an impact from PACCAR specific engine parts show up in the mix of the segment, is that what\u2019s happening?","Ronald Armstrong","Yeah, so obviously the PACCAR engines have been in Europe for many years and so that\u2019s always been there. And we\u2019re seeing the growth of the PACCAR MX engine at the end of last year. We had 75,000 engines in the market and that will continue to grow again this year. So as time goes on we\u2019ll continue to see that benefit, more and more parts sales supporting PACCAR engines.","Joseph Vruwink","Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer","Hi, good morning.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Wertheimer","I wonder, I mean, I had a smaller impact on the transactional offset from currency. I wonder if you can give an overview. I mean, I know you had started assembly of engines here. Then you sort of moved more integrated. I mean, there\u2019s obviously a bunch of more that I\u2019m not thinking of that you\u2019re sending, I guess, from Europe to U.S. I mean, if you could just outline generally what that stuff is?","Ronald Armstrong","Well, we\u2019re buying blocks and heads, and a lot of components for our plant in Columbus from European suppliers. So a good portion of the material content comes from Europe.","Robert Wertheimer","Perfect, that I figure, is there much outside of engines or no?","Ronald Armstrong","No, that is primarily engine component.","Robert Wertheimer","Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up that offline. Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, thanks, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI.","David Raso","Yes, my question is related to currency. I mean, the operational improvement was solid for the quarter, but isn\u2019t that currency did help your margins by 60 bps? So somewhat related to the last question that should also be a help to 2Q as well, but can you explain in a little more detail if you could how currency, obviously negative 7% or so for the quarter can still be neutral on EBIT, because the 60 bps help to the quarter is obviously something that helped the quarter. It should have happened for 2Q, maybe even 3Q. But once the currency situation flattens out I\u2019m just trying to manage the expectations here a little bit on the margin performance what\u2019s really operational versus just currency.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, most of the effects are operational. I mean, we had - I guess, I mentioned on the profit side the translation effects on our pretax income were largely offset by the effects of the natural hedge that we have with the purchase of components. I don\u2019t know that the 60 basis points, they don\u2019t recognize that number. So but\u2026","David Raso","Well, just to be clear, maybe clarify if I heard incorrectly. $281 million revenue helped to truck and other, correct?","Ronald Armstrong","No, that was a\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","A decline.","Ronald Armstrong","\u2026a decline.","Unidentified Company Representative","A decline.","David Raso","Well, I mean, helped meaning you take away the revenue.","Ronald Armstrong","Sure.","David Raso","But there is no impact on the EBIT. That\u2019s 60 bps help to the margins.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, it\u2019s - yes, okay.","David Raso","And that should help 2Q as well and 3Q, but just want to think about the cadence of the gross margin guidance. It is 14 then up a little bit, but then only for the year it seems like the second-half is not sequentially improving. Is that partly it, you lose some of the currency help to margin, is that the way to think about it?","Ronald Armstrong","No, as we mentioned for the second quarter, yes, we will see some slight improvement with the higher volumes, the currency impact, assuming a constant currency as were at now we\u2019ll see a similar benefit in the second quarter.","David Raso","But then the second-half diminishes a little bit and that\u2019s why - I\u2019m just trying to manage expectations little bit on, it\u2019s not gross margins that\u2019s going up 14.5, then 14.9 in the back-half, and then to 16. Just being sensitive to the currency is helping the gross margin right now - the operating margin as well.","Ronald Armstrong","It benefitted in the first quarter and we\u2019ll see that benefit, again assuming that consistent with the current the translation rates we\u2019ll see that benefit in the second quarter as well.","David Raso","All right, that\u2019s great. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, sure. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray.","Alexander Potter","Hi guys, one housekeeping question here. Could we get the deliveries by region, so Europe, U.S., Canada, and other?","Ronald Armstrong","Sure. U.S. deliveries were 21,400 in 2015 and compared to 16,100 last year. Canada was 3,000 compared to 2,500. Europe was 10,100 compared and 9,300. And Mexico, Australia and other was 3,800 compared to 3,900 last year.","Alexander Potter","Okay, excellent. And then, I guess, one last question on pricing. You mentioned that in Europe obviously the trajectory of pricing is going to be dependent upon the strength of the market that competitive position where ultimately it comes down to volume. In North America we\u2019re obviously seeing very strong volume typically speaking that, I should imply that the OEMs have good pricing pressure, but we haven\u2019t necessarily seen a big uptick in pricing. I was just wondering if you can comment on what exactly it is you think is going on there. Thanks.","Ronald Armstrong","Well, I think, again it\u2019s a very competitive market and each transaction is negotiated with the customer and the dealer. And so you reflect what the market conditions are, and so we have great products and get the premium value for what we sell and so that\u2019s evidenced by the fact that our operating margins when compared and looked at the competition are the highest in the industry. So you were proud of our product and we\u2019ll look to continue to grow our share profitably.","Alexander Potter","Okay, thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi, good morning. A quick question regarding used truck price in North America, what are you seeing in the market? Are you seeing any signs of softening with greater supply coming into the market?","Ronald Armstrong","I\u2019d say that the prices are certainly aren\u2019t going up. They\u2019re stable compared to where they were a year ago. There are more trucks, but there\u2019s also a bit more demand so pricing is very stable. And we see the similar thing in Europe. Prices in Europe were reasonably stable, compared to where they were at this time last year.","Neil Frohnapple","All right, and then can you provide any more color on what you\u2019re seeing in the medium-duty market in North America, and your outlook for that business this year relative to heavy-duty?","Ronald Armstrong","So, I think last year, the medium 6 tonne to 7 tonne market was in the 73,000 truck range and we think to 70,000 to 80,000 trucks is a reasonable range for that market for this year. So market is started off with good demand. We\u2019ve been able to increase our production of the Peterbilt and Kenworth medium-duty trucks for the North American market and so we\u2019re\u2026","Neil Frohnapple","Great. And then just one last one, can you provide the MX penetration rate in the U.S. and Canada in Q1? And as follow-up, any way to quantify the percentage in your current order board and just curious if you\u2019re on track to get in the 40% range for the full-year outlook like you guys have outlined at Mid-America? Thank you.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, so the first quarter was about 37% for MX and 40% is very reasonable target for this year.","Neil Frohnapple","Great. Thanks very much.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","Good morning, gentlemen.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Ted.","Ted Grace","I was hoping to circle back the parts. Could you just comment how each region performed kind of U.S., Europe? And I just want to confirm, did you say that FX was a $49 million headwind to parts overall?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes. It was, $49 million is the effect. So both North America and Europe performed very well in the parts business and so the effects of currency is primarily the effect of the euro.","Ted Grace","So for organically Europe more like 10%. Could you just maybe give us\u2026","Ronald Armstrong","So if you add back the exchange rate effect, that\u2019s roughly where the growth would have been in 10% range.","Ted Grace","Yes, yes, exactly. Could you just give us a sense for what U.S., what it done versus Europe in the context of that 10%?","Ronald Armstrong","So U.S., North America would be slightly above the 10% and Europe would be slightly below.","Ted Grace","Okay, okay. And then the other thing I just wanted to ask you, Ron, if you take out your long-term crystal ball and you think about PACCAR\u2019s vertical integration looking up five or 10 years, how would you kind of frame what PACCAR will look like on that basis, looking that far out?","Ronald Armstrong","I mean that\u2019s - we\u2019ve got an excellent business model that serves us well, we obviously a little bit more vertical integration in Europe, where we make axles, we buy axels in North America. So we have the flexibility. And from time to time, we will evaluate what level of vertical integration makes sense for our company but I think we are very comfortable with where we are at currently and I don\u2019t see any major revisions to how we manage that and positioned ourselves in the marketplace in the near future.","Ted Grace","In the near future, but I mean is there potential to see some type of step function improvement looking out 5 years or 10 years, or is that the wrong way to think about the business?","Ronald Armstrong","Anything can happen, but I would say at this point we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the structure as we have it today.","Ted Grace","Got it, okay. Well, congratulations again and best of luck this quarter, guys.","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Reena Krishnan","Hi, good morning. This is\u2026","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning, Scott.","Reena Krishnan","Hi, good morning. This is actually Reena Krishnan sitting in for Scott Group.","Ronald Armstrong","Okay.","Reena Krishnan","So most of our questions have been answered. Maybe just a follow up on that question related to vertical integration, I guess, you guys mentioned you\u2019re comfortable where things are. Does that mean you haven\u2019t thought about maybe looking at where you could be with the medium-duty market in terms of more vertical integration? Or is it just something you don\u2019t want to talk about at this moment, if you guys feel comfortable just giving some color there?","Ronald Armstrong","Yes, I think we\u2019ve got great medium-duty products, but obviously out over the years we continue to invest in all of our products and we will continue to make enhancements to heavy-duty, medium-duty engines, components, work closely with our major suppliers around the world to provide us customized products that integrate with our componentry to provide outstanding operating solution for our customers. And so I think we\u2019ll continue to have an ongoing investment program that will continue to move the needle forward for us.","Reena Krishnan","Okay and then just one last follow-up related to fleet expansion. Could you guys maybe give us some color in terms of what you are hearing from your fleets as it relates to fleet expansion this year versus last year? Would you say it\u2019s at a similar level or is it accelerating, again just in the context of where the driver situation is and where capacity could probably be for the industry?","Ronald Armstrong","In think it\u2019s a similar state of affairs for our customers that they are all making very good of profits in their business reinvesting in new trucks and expanding their fleet I think both strategically and tactically. So, this is really just the second year where we\u2019ve had expansion after five or six years of below replacement level demand. So I think our customers are enjoying good rates, good profitability and thinking about their business expansion plans in a pretty aggressive way.","Reena Krishnan","Okay, great. Thank you for your time.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Shlisky with Global Hunter Securities.","Mike Shlisky","Good morning.","Ronald Armstrong","Good morning.","Mike Shlisky","You had mentioned in your release that your key plants are producing at record levels and it sounds like you\u2019ll have probably another record coming up here in Q2. Is there a way you can kind of quantify for us just how close you are in your max levels and are there any break-points where you had that additional shifts which may impact margins above a certain volume level going forward?","Ronald Armstrong","We\u2019re in great position capacity-wise. We have lots of capacity to support higher production levels in North America, Europe and around the world, so were in great shape capacity-wise.","Mike Shlisky","Great, thanks. And just to kind of follow up on that, could you maybe just tell us a little bit about are you constrained at all with your people at your facilities? Are they at some point maxed out, where you\u2019re going to have to hire some additional folks who might be less experienced to handle additional volumes?","Ronald Armstrong","As we go up in volumes, we have provided great opportunities for people that live and work around our factories. We are a great employer. We have a great working environment, and so when we solicit applications for people to join our company, we always get many more than the number of openings. So filling open positions for our factories is something that obviously takes time and effort and a lot of focus to get the right people, but lots of supply to support the demand that we have.","Mike Shlisky","Super. Great quarter. I appreciate you guys.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.","Michael Feniger","Hey, guys, this is Mike, just filling in for Ross Gilardi. Just a quick question, the U.S. market has been on a gradual upward trajectory, orders have been strong in Q4. They\u2019re trying to - they came back a little bit in March. What\u2019s your view, the biggest risk to get to the bottom end of your forecast?","Ronald Armstrong","It would be the economy. I mean, if the economy softens substantially in the second quarter, things don\u2019t progresses as economists project. That clearly is the thing that has the biggest impact on our business. So the economy is good. I think you will continue to see good demand. When you look at the products that we continue to enhance, you\u2019ve got connected truck capability. You\u2019ve got the predictive cruise control capability for our products. And so, the attractiveness in the operating benefits that customers can get with current products that we will be introducing into the market in the second-half are very attractive propositions for them.","Michael Feniger","Thanks, guys.","Ronald Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] There are no other questions in the queue at this point.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller. [Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported improved revenues and net income for the second quarter of 2014. PACCAR's second quarter sales in financial services revenue were $4.6 billion and quarterly net income was $319 million and after-tax return on revenues of 7%. Revenues were up 6% and net income increased 9% compared to the results generated in the second quarter last year.","PACCAR Parts achieved record sales this quarter, and PACCAR Financial generated record pretax profits. I'm very proud of our 22,600 employees, who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","PACCAR delivered 33,700 trucks during the second quarter, a 6% increase versus the first quarter this year. This growth reflects increased truck deliveries in the U.S. and Canada due to the ongoing replacement of the aging truck population and higher fleet utilization driven by record freight tonnage. Looking ahead, we expect to increase truck deliveries in the third quarter by about 5% compared to the second quarter, reflecting the continued strength of the North American Class 8 market.","Third quarter gross margins should be slightly higher than the second quarter, reflecting the benefits of higher production and improved operating efficiencies. It is encouraging that U.S. employments gains this year have been the strongest since 2006. Other good economic news is that U.S. auto sales are projected to be over 16 million vehicles and housing starts over 1 million units this year. These positive trends are benefiting truck demand in North America.","U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 230,000 to 250,000 trucks this year. Industry orders for Class 8 trucks in the U.S. and Canada for the first half were over 145,000 trucks, a 34% increase over the comparable period last year. Economic news in Europe is trending positively, with GDP growth expectations for this year of 1.1%. Year-to-date through June, freight in Germany, as measured by the amount index, was 3% higher than the same period last year. Europe's greater than 16-tonne market is projected to be in the range of 210,000 to 230,000 units. Customers in Europe accelerated purchases of Euro 5 vehicles last year and are gradually adjusting to the increased prices of Euro 6 trucks. Production of DAF Trucks in Brazil is progressing, with build rates expected to increase gradually through 2014.","PACCAR Parts business generated record quarterly revenues of $778 million, a 10% increase compared to $710 million in the same quarter of the prior year. PACCAR Parts quarterly pretax income was $127 million, an increase of 16% compared to the $109 million earned in the second quarter of 2013. The strong results were driven by improved fleet utilization and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR Parts.","PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $303 million in the second quarter compared to $289 million a year ago. PACCAR Financials' second quarter pretax income was a record $92 million compared to $82 million earned last year. The improved results benefited from growth in asset balances and excellent portfolio performance.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $2.1 billion in new products and facilities in the last 3 years. In the second quarter, DAF introduced a new range of Euro 6 CF and XF 4-axle trucks and tractors for heavy-duty applications. These new vehicles expand DAF's product range in the construction, container and refuse markets.","In addition, Kenworth and Peterbilt launched new medium-duty cabover trucks, with extensive exterior and interior enhancement. The Kenworth K270 and K370 and the Peterbilt Model 220 have been designed with an enhanced turning radius and shorter overall length to excel in urban delivery applications.","PACCAR's capital spending of $250 million to $300 million this year is targeted at enhanced powertrain development and increased operating efficiency of our assembly facilities. Research and development expenses are estimated to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million.","During the second quarter, PACCAR's Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to a record $0.22 per share. PACCAR's increased the regular quarterly dividend by more than 140% in the last 5 years. PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest-quality products and services in the industry, investing in new geographic regions and providing excellent returns to our shareholders.","On behalf of the PACCAR management team, I'd like to thank the many analysts and investors who attended our investor conference on May 28 and 29 at Peterbilt's Denton, Texas plant. We enjoyed sharing our plans and our world-class facilities and products with you, and we appreciate your feedback on the event.","I'd be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase from Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just a couple of questions for you. First, Ron, if you could comment a little bit more on your acceptance of Euro 6 pricing. Obviously, it's been a hot issue for you guys. How does it trend during the quarter? Is commentary getting any better? And what's your expectation for Europe as we move into the back half of the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. Euro 6 pricing is, as we've identified before, is up quite a bit over the Euro 5 pricing. It has been challenging to gain acceptance of that pricing in the market, and we've recovered the price increase but not realized any additional margin on that. So that continues to be the case, the European market is very competitive. And -- but I think we see with the fundamentals, the economic fundamentals of Europe trending positively that once the market normalizes that we'll see an increase in demand as we progress to the second half.","Nicole DeBlase - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly, so you said gross margin's up slightly Q-on-Q. I think last quarter, you were a little bit more explicit. You set up 20 to 40 basis points. Is there any way you could kind of frame what up slightly means?","Ronald E. Armstrong","It's slightly. It's not a significant amount.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Barclays -- I'm sorry, Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I'm going to actually follow-up a little bit on Europe, if that's all right. You're talking about the second half being up a little bit sequentially. I guess the first one, is you talked about 5% sort of quarter-over-quarter production increase. Is Europe up quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. We have our traditional summer shutdown period in the third quarter, so it's not up. So the increases is North America.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so then, I guess, you would assume the fourth quarter in Europe is a little bit better. I think you're planning for second half to be a little higher. Do you have orders sort of on the books for that or is it sort of that you're hoping the economy kind of continues to sort of come back a little bit?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So I think it's more focused on the economic fundamentals that are there and supporting the increased freight activity that we're seeing.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. I got it. And then my final question is can you just say something about pricing in the North American market? Given the amount of volume we have here, I guess, I would think maybe things would be starting to get a little bit better but any color would be great.","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think pretty steady. The buyers of trucks are large fleet customers that we have long-term relationships with, and so I'd say it's pretty steady.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just my -- another follow-up question on the margin front. I mean, to Nicole's point, you guided to a 20 to 40 basis point margin improvement sequentially last quarter and on the gross margin line you came in 80 bps better. So in your opinion, sort of what drove the upside surprise? And then at what point do you feel like -- or what do you need to see where you feel like we finally get some year-over-year improvement on the gross margin line, because in the first half of the year it's still trending down year-over-year? And then my last question relates to the Parts business. We've seen, I think, this is like the -- I don't know, fourth or fifth -- actually, no, I mean, probably 6 quarters of pretty good top line growth and we're trending in sort of the high-single-digit range. Do you think that's sustainable going forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong","That's a multifaceted question, Jamie. So the European -- or just the margin side...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. Your margins were better than what you forecast.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure. And so...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so I'm trying to figure out if that's the same for Q3? And then what do you need to see to get to year-over-year gross margin improvement?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure. So as we think about margins in the second quarter, I mean, there's a combination of some price realization in North America, rigorous cost control and then the operating efficiency of running our factories at a higher rate. So those 3 things, I think, combined. We'll see some benefit from operating efficiency in the third quarter again, but we also have the shutdown period, which has a bit of fixed cost that goes with that. So that's a little bit of an offset, some of the upside on operating leverage.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then what do you need to see -- to start to see year-over-year improvement in gross margins? And then last is the growth that you've seen in parts, which has been pretty healthy, do you think that's sustainable in the back half of the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure. I think, obviously, the market strength of the market is the key thing that drives margins over time. And so if demand continues to accelerate and backlogs get extended, that probably provides some pricing leverage opportunity. We're anticipating good market, steady market as we progress through the second half. So we'll see how that develops. And Parts has had an excellent performance and wonderful products. There are TRP brands, the PACCAR Genuine and DAF parts product lines have done excellently. And so we'll continue to see some level of growth. Right now, we're thinking, for the year, somewhere in the 5% to 8% range, I think.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Can I push in the margin one more time?","Robert J. Christensen","Sure.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I mean, I guess, I sit here and I look, and your gross margins have been pretty consistent over the past couple of years, 2012, 2013. It looks like we'll end 2014 at some point and we're 5 years into what historically has been a 6-year cycle. So is there the risk of this cycle just given where we are unless your view of this cycle is different that we just don't get the improvement in gross margin?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, the peak in the last cycle, if you'll recall, Europe and North America was a 300,000-plus truck market with backlogs extended almost up to a year at points and we're nowhere near those kinds of numbers. So that provides a unique pricing opportunity that's not present currently.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question back on Parts. Was there any specific region that grew faster than the other regions, specifically, I guess, was U.S. and Canada kind of the shining star in the quarter or was it pretty well spread at that 10% rate against -- across most regions?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. I think U.S. and Canada was up a little bit more than average in Europe, just a little bit below that. But both had excellent quarters and good performance by the team and the markets, like I said, with freight activity at pretty good levels in all of our markets that's supporting good Parts business.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if it's possible, could you kind of address the demand trends that you're seeing outside of -- the ones that you've already talked about, Europe, U.S., Canada, Brazil, specifically, I guess Mexico, Australia and then the Andean region?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Okay. So let's start with Mexico. Mexico, good start to 2013, softened in the back half of last year. We're starting to see some improvement in demand in the Mexican market, as well as in the Andean region. There's some emissions changes that are occurring in Colombia that are going to be positive to demand in the second half of this year. Brazil, the market is soft -- softening. Economic growth there is slowing. But again, we're on a slow, steady ramp-up period, so it doesn't really impact us but we continue our slow and steady ramp-up in Brazil. Australia is, I'd say, steady. Not -- GDP growth is relatively low. Mining activities lower than it has been, but just good and steady.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. But first of all, it feels like some of your customers are really getting pinched by the driver shortage now. And I guess, on one hand, it's putting pressure on them to buy new trucks to retain drivers. On the other hand, it's probably pressuring their business on wage inflation and things like that. So going forward, do you think an ongoing driver shortage contributes positively or negatively to your business?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think, obviously, Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF products are at the top of the market in terms of driver, in terms of their need for -- or their desire for new trucks to drive. They're the great fit and finish, great performance and become a real asset for a company as they're recruiting drivers. So I think it could have a positive potential on demand for the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF products.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the flip side, are you seeing any signs that some of the pressure, some of the driver shortage are adversely impacting order patterns for trucks into the second half of the year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don't know if I would see it impacting the patterns per se. I think they're -- all other things being equal, customers would buy some additional trucks if they had a clear path to having additional drivers, but I don't see it affecting the patterns that we've seen over the last several quarters.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then on Brazil, I mean, obviously, your business is just starting out and you've got a very good long runway ahead of you. But I'm kind of surprised you didn't reduce your outlook for the Brazilian truck market that may not really impact how many trucks you can sell in particular this year. But just wondering is it more difficult to get customers to take a chance on a new brand in a weaker market like this right now? And do the current market conditions in Brazil dampen your penetration expectations in the next several years at all?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. So the market size that we referenced in the press release is the South American Class 8 market, which includes Brazil, Argentina as well as the Andean region. We see -- within that, Brazil being down 10% or so, the Andean region being maybe a little more flat compared to where it was prior year. I think, last year, the total number for the South America was 160,000 trucks or so. We're thinking 140,000, 150,000. So down 5% to 10% over last year's levels for the South American Class 8 market. And in terms of our business, again, we're just ramping up, getting going. And our guys are -- our team has just performed excellently there in terms of getting the factory up and running. Our dealers are still building out their facilities to represent DAF in the marketplace. And so that whole process continues. But we still see the long-term prospects for our business to be excellent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So can you talk about what you're seeing in Eastern Europe right now? How much of a risk is that market, specifically Russia to your outlook? You've already -- we've seen issues there with some of your competitors. Are you seeing anything there yet that we need to be concerned with?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think as it stands now, we'll see fewer truck deliveries in Russia this year than we saw last year because of the -- some of the challenges that are there in the area. But it continues to be -- we've continued to increase our representation with dealers in the area. We have a strong park. We're expecting good growth in parts sales in the area. So it's a bit challenging for the short term, but long term we feel very good about the development of our business in Russia and continuing to grow that over the coming years.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Ron, as you sort of build out your MX engines, what we see also in the industry is some of the guys who were your suppliers, too, have talked about higher warranty expense on some of their new engines. How comfortable are you guys in sort of warranty expense control as you go forward that we won't see a little bit of volatility there as we go forward with PACCAR?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think with the introduction of on-board diagnostics, the industry, as you mentioned, have seen some challenges, all the complexity that goes with that. But there's been a nice progression of -- with our sales and others, and we'll continue to see that progression as we get more and more experienced with those regulations and guidelines. And so we're comfortable that we'll perform very well and our engines are very well received by the customers, great reliability, durability and the fuel efficiency is just -- has been very well received. So we're -- we still view it as a great upside potential for our engine business long term.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ron, can I ask just you quickly about the vocational market? You guys talked about it being strong earlier this year. Construction have gotten more mixed here over the summer. Do you still see any strength in that market for you guys?","Robert J. Christensen","Yes. I think -- this is Bob. The vocational market is, certainly, year-on-year much stronger than it was last year at this time, and PACCAR with new products for both Kenworth and Peterbilt in the North American market is very well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to take a step back and just ask you in North America, what you're seeing out there in the fundamentals from demand for the oil tanks to transport domestic oil. And also, are you seeing any customers purchasing trucks to take advantage of the rail capacity issues that we're seeing out there, particularly in the Midwest?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. I don't think either of those are significant factors up or down. I'd say it's fairly consistent in terms of the number of trucks that we're selling to customers in those areas. I think things are good, solid, but nothing, I guess, I would say is a significant trend upward or downward in that.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then same question, I guess, on sleepers versus take cabs. Any change in the trends there or anything incremental?","Robert J. Christensen","No. I think our sleeper mix has remained fairly steady, perhaps it's grown slightly as we've seen some of the fleets play some expansion orders. But in general, a pretty standard mix for us.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on the pricing side, are you seeing any aggressive pricing by your competitors? We're hearing about discounts to list price on one of your competitors for -- if you buy their entire drivetrain. Are you seeing any aggressive pricing from your competitors to encourage full integration -- fully integrated drivetrains?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Nothing I would say that's pervasive in the market. Everybody has their particular conquest point that they protect and go after. But I'd say it's pretty steady market in that regards. In Europe, with sort of the softness of Euro 6, pretty competitive pricing environment but nothing peculiar to any particular manufacturer.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then Europe, any particular region or is it just in general because customers are bolting at the increased price?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, just in general.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ron, I'm wondering if you could talk about how the product warranty performance is tracking in Europe? I know you have a lot of test miles, can you just update on how that's playing out in the marketplace? And also can you just flush out your prior comment on U.S. on-board diagnostics? Is that an issue that you're monitoring or have you taken up your accrual rates there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. So Euro 6, the products have been very well received by customers, both from a reliability and fuel efficiency standpoint. So very well received, continue to get good accolades. DAF, in fact, just -- was recognized in Poland as truck of the year with their products. So good recognition. And from our perspective, obviously, there's a lot of elements of the truck that are new and were very well designed and again, receiving good accolades. So we'll continue to experience good warranty performance on those trucks as we progress through this year. The on-board diagnostics, again, it's something that's affected the entire industry. Everybody has transitioned with that. And we're seeing steady progression of managing that, and it'll be well managed as we go forward.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I know it will come out in the Q, but can you share your warranty expense with us in the quarter, just so we get a sense of how much of the margin improvement that you saw this quarter was on the warranty side?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. I don't have those numbers, Jerry. It's not a major element of our total cost structure. I think on the 10-Q, it combines expense with extended warranty and a few other things. So I don't have those numbers readily available.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But maybe as part of the discussion on the warranty -- or on the margin trends in the back half of the year, this is one area that if you continue to execute consistent with your prior product rollouts, that can be an area that drives margins above prior year levels in the back half of the year. Is that reasonable?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Warranty is just a standard part in doing business. And I would say there's not any significant trends one way or another reflected in our results.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And from a CapEx standpoint, you've made a slight tweak to the CapEx plan this quarter. But compared to the prior guidance or the initial 2014 guidance, you're reducing CapEx by about $100 million. Can you just talk about what areas of your capital deployment plans you're tightening the belt on? But is it all around or are there any specific projects where you're delaying or holding back on?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So it's really timing. There are some product and facility activities that we've got on our plans. So just the timing of executing those has been pushed out a bit as we look at when we're ready to execute on certain things. So no particular things that have been just -- it's really mostly timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just -- can you talk a little longer term about expansion plans? Maybe over the next couple of years, Brazil is going to be where you want it to be and running on track. And what would be some of the next areas that you think you can grow the company? Is it finance or geographic?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure. Brazil is clearly an opportunity to continue just to achieve the targets that we've set out for Brazil. So that's an excellent opportunity. And as we look to the Eastern Europe, Russia, Ukraine, think about Turkey, those provide some good opportunities upside long term. As we talked about Russia, short-term challenges but long term, we feel good about that. And then Asia is an opportunity where, as you know, we don't have great participation in the truck market at this point. And we've got offices in India and China that represent us well. And we have a technical center in India. We do a lot of procurement in those areas. And so we stay very close to those markets to understand what the trends are and continue to look for an opportunity at the right time to participate. But at this point, nothing short term in our drawing board.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I know you guys won't help us probably with anything behind the scenes on merger talks with Volkswagen. But can you just remind us what the company's sort of overall thinking is on selling the company or anything like that? Do you feel like you guys are always for sale at the right price? Or do you feel like there's nobody who can do a better job than the current management team, so there's no need. You know what I mean? Just sort of the philosophical angle on how you think about that.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Joel, I mean, there have been no discussions with Volkswagen and the company continues to focus on running the business day in, day out, and we've got a great team and that's our focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I just had 2 follow-ups. First on PACCAR Financial, continues to improve there on a year-over-year basis. Can you just give us some color on what you expect for the remainder of 2014 and into next year?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. The asset base has continued to grow. Our teams there have done an excellent job of representing our capabilities in the marketplace. There's -- as time goes on, particularly North America, as the truck markets improve, more and more competitors like to wade back into the market. But our teams -- we have great service capability and continue to win. About 30% of the new PACCAR trucks that get sold are funded by our PACCAR Financial and PACCAR Leasing businesses. So we'll continue, I think, to see that as the retail sales grow so, too, will our asset base, somewhat. And so that would be a positive development for us as we progress through the year. And customers with the good freight conditions are performing very well and paying their truck payments. We continue to see past dues below 1% in our portfolio. So no indications that, that's going to change in the near term. But -- so good performance by our finance team and used truck markets are in good shape. We've seen probably 4% to 5% appreciation in used truck prices year-on-year. So things are in good shape and the teams are executing very well.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And can you expand on your ability to raise rates to customers as your borrowing costs could start to move higher as you move into 2015?","Ronald E. Armstrong","We're typically -- the yield to the customer typically moves -- maybe it's not basis point by basis point, but generally moves in the same direction as our borrowing cost.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if I could just sneak one quick one. On the SG&A, it actually came down sequentially on an absolute dollar basis despite the increase in revenue in the quarter, sequentially. Was there any timing issues we should be thinking about there or is that a pretty clean number?","Ronald E. Armstrong","It's a pretty clean number. Yes, the first quarter had, typically, has a little bit more, I think, stock compensation-related expenses included in it, so that's pretty steady as she goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher from UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You guys have a pretty diversified customer base in North American heavy-duty truck. How should we think about what types of customers are only replacing versus those that are actually expanding capacity at this point?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I guess, I would say that in any sector there's probably a combination of some, and then there are probably some that are actually downsizing depending on their trends in the business. So I don't know if I see any...","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Or maybe I'll ask it this way. In terms of sort of larger fleets versus independent operators or midsized, any differentiating trends among those classifications?","Robert J. Christensen","I think that our customers are seeing a good rate environment. They have generally high-utilization rates and generally across-the-board, irrespective of the fleet size or the vocation, are continuing to replace equipment and expanding their fleet to accommodate the new opportunities with a little bit better economy out there. And I wouldn't say that there's one segment that is unique in that regard. It's really across-the-board with all of our customer segments.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I know you mentioned the freight growth rate in Germany. But within Western Europe, more broadly, can you maybe differentiate what demand trends you're seeing in some of these specific markets?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I would say that based on what -- the statistical availability is a little more limited in Europe, but I would say that Germany is a pretty good proxy for, generally, what we're seeing in Europe in terms of freight activity. That it's probably up in most countries in Europe year-on-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So one quick question on U.S. or North American production. I think you had signaled a bigger production increase than you did in the quarter. Was there anything to that? Was it the driver shortage or any other factors or is it just normal variability?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. It really was the fact that Europe was a little softer than what we had thought when we talked in April.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Perfect. And then just a second -- maybe I'll just wrap it all together. I don't know if you gave your MX engine penetration in North America or U.S. and Canada, however you want to do it, this quarter. And I'm curious as to whether that was margin accretive in the quarter. Yes, I'm not sure you've ever talked about that very explicitly. And then whether you've seen any stopping points, whether you've hit any saturation or whether it can continue to build in the order book.","Ronald E. Armstrong","So we were at about 35% penetration for the quarter. And we'll continue, I think, as we progress, we -- you look at the MX engine and the applications that it can meet the needs of our customers. We'll continue to see that, that percentage will grow over time as you see in the marketplace, about 50%. 13-liter, 50%; 15-liter engine sales in the Class 8 market. And we think that it will continue to trend more towards 13-liter over time as people look for reduced weight per fuel economy. So we see that the prospects for the MX are good. In terms of margins, it's just part of the cost of our truck and -- so no real margin impact.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Now that's great. And do you have any comment on -- I think you launched in Mexico, how's the initial feedback on that? And I'll stop there.","Ronald E. Armstrong","It's good. We're selling the MX in the Mexican market at a Euro 4 level. And obviously, that's a level that we sold in Europe for many years. And so it's been well received, it performs well, great fuel efficiency as well as torque and horsepower ratings. So very well received.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So back at the Analyst Day, I think you had talked about, for Brazil, needing a kind of a build 10 units per day to kind of get a good -- to get a positive return. Can you just update us on that when you think you might get there? Is that still the right number to think about?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think that's still a fair number to think about, and we're probably 2015 or so before we get to that point.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you update us on how the distribution build out's going there?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Going good. Our dealers are investing in 20 locations. So several are open, several are near open and several well along in the construction phase. By the end of this year, most of the initial 20 facilities will be completed, and several of the next phase or next 20 facilities that are committed will be started. So that is progressing well.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up, the new DAF vocational trucks you introduced, I guess, this quarter, can you give us any color there and indicate was that accretive to margin in the quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. It really is -- it's just the -- what it was is the -- as we transition from Euro 5 to Euro 6, these are the more complex, high-content trucks and were sort of the last batches of the DAF Euro 6 vehicles to be introduced. And so now that really completes their Euro 6 offerings but not that many sales in the quarter, but it really just replaces a comparable Euro 5 offering.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","So Ron, I think in one of the earlier questions about margins, you talked about hey, the last cycle, we got to a really high build numbers and backlogs. I get the backlogs not there, but we're ordering trucks on a run rate north of 300,000 right now. So why isn't this the time to get more price? And do you think -- can PACCAR take a leadership role to start trying to push more pricing?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, we feel like we always have a leadership role and we are the premium product in the market, so that's how we approach our business. And we work very closely with our customers to provide them competitive -- competitively priced vehicles that recognize the value that the PACCAR products provide. And so it's all driven by the competitive marketplace and we'll continue to maintain our leadership position.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Do you think this is the environment where you can start pushing pricing harder or still not there yet?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Again, it's a 240,000 plus or minus truck market and some of the truck markets that we talked about previously were 300,000 truck markets. And so if you look back, over time, there's a pretty good correlation with the size of the truck market and the ability to price and leverage your cost structure.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then just last question. So I see you guys increased the dividend this quarter. Can you share with us were there any discussions at the board about starting to emphasize the share buyback anymore?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. We have an authorization that has about $100 million or so of unused buyback capacity. So as we have, historically, we buy back shares from time to time and we'll continue to evaluate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I guess, first, just a housekeeping question. Can you give deliveries for Europe and North America in the quarter?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So for U.S. and Canada, 20,500 trucks; 8,900 in Europe; and 4,300 for Rest of World.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then wanted to touch one last time here on gross profitability just to make sure I understood correctly. It sounds like -- clearly, you had nice volume in North America that helps things. Price realization in North America helps things, presumably a mixed shift towards parts helps things. But Europe, on a sequential basis, wasn't any better, wasn't any worse than it was last quarter. Is that fair?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I'd say that's a pretty fair assessment.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Very good. And then, lastly, you mentioned in the release that you're focusing some CapEx and I guess R&D on \"enhanced powertrain development.\" Just wondering if you can elaborate, I guess, strategically on exactly what that means? That would be very helpful.","Ronald E. Armstrong","So obviously, the customers that operate our trucks are focused on the lowest total cost of ownership, and fuel being one of the more expensive parts of their cost of operation. And so we're very focused on gleaning every percent improvement in fuel economy that we can from a variety of sources, including the aerodynamics of the truck itself, the engine, operating efficiency, the integration of the engine with the transmission and axles and Aftertreatment Systems. So it's a continuous focus by our teams, both here and in Europe, to achieve industry-leading fuel efficiency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","I was wondering if you could speak to what you're seeing in material cost trends and with the build rate in North America going up. Have you seen any supply chain issues pop up yet?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So I think material costs are pretty steady. Cost movements have not been a significant factor from quarter-to-quarter even year-on-year. And in terms of supply-based performance, it's just -- it's normal business, business as usual. And our supply base is moving in lockstep with us. Any day, there might be a little bit disturbance. But all in all, suppliers are performing very well.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. Got you. And then when you think about your build plan in North America for the second half of the year, how full are you right now? And are the orders reaching out into 2015? And along with that, have you established 2015 pricing yet?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I mean, we do. We have long-term orders that we assume, we take in and so there are some trucks that are on the board for 2015 delivery, it's not a significant amount. And we're -- work closely with our customers to provide them competitive pricing, whether it's short term, mid term or long term. Well, it's sort of business as you as usual in that regard so...","Robert J. Christensen","Plants are in great shape. We have lots of capacity to handle the demand that we're seeing.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker from Robert W. Baird.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Joe Vruwink on the line for David. When you look of the success you've had in driving growth in the Parts business, is there maybe a way to isolate the contribution from internal engines versus maybe some expanded coverage initiatives maybe just from the carry through you've had from strong new truck volumes this cycle?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, I think all of those elements have made a contribution to the Parts growth, as well as the truck utilization. So we have very well-developed All Makes brand with TRP that services not only other makes of trucks, but the bus and trailer segment. We have the PACCAR Genuine and DAF brand of parts in Europe that are represented very well. And our Parts team put together very innovative programs to continue to build and capture a greater share of the parts marketplace. So all of those things are contributing to the incremental growth that PACCAR Parts is achieving.","Robert J. Christensen","We should also give some credit to our dealer body. They are actively investing in their business, expanding their locations, expanding their hours of service and -- it's really a combination of the programs of PACCAR Parts and how our dealers are performing in the markets.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So the new Parts center that's being constructed later this year, is that just to support the existing run rate on the business or is it anticipation of any maybe additional growth initiatives you could outline?","Ronald E. Armstrong","That's really supporting the continued growth and supporting our dealers that are in the Northwestern part of the U.S. And so -- but it's pretty normal. Last year, we doubled the size of our Lancaster facility and this will be essentially a doubling of our capacity in the Northwest U.S. But over time, all of our PDCs, we either expand them or build new ones to support the increased distribution opportunity that we have.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, lastly, just wanted to touch on financing sort of in the industry. So when you look at the captive credit arms of the truck companies, there's been pretty good success this cycle and kind of filling a void left by the other financing arms or the other finance hole[ph], like, commercial, let's say. Wondering if you're seeing a greater push by some of these other lending sources and sort of a chase for yield to help facilitate maybe a higher level of industry volume going forward?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think, again, as I think I've commented earlier, what we see at this point in the cycle, there are increased entrants into the financing world, which can create a more competitive pricing environment. But customers appreciate PACCAR Financial and PACCAR Leasing. The fact that we're here throughout the cycle, we only finance trucks and trailers for the industry. Our people are well versed in providing the best service, so that's a real competitive advantage for our team.","Joseph D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Would you expect your penetration levels to stay pretty much the same and does that need to come at the expense of maybe in that margin?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. I think 30% penetration is about where we'll stay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple from Longbow Research.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","Clearly, you had a strong parts revenue quarter. But as customers are increasing the replacement of their aged fleets, are you anticipating any sort of parts revenue slow down or growth to at least decelerate at some point like in 2015 due to the strength of the new truck sales that would essentially bring down the average age of the fleet?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I don't think that will be a significant factor. Again, with the new truck volumes, there's still lots of parts opportunities that go with outfitting trucks and accessories, et cetera. So I don't see that as being a major factor in terms of parts movement.","Neil Frohnapple - Longbow Research LLC","All right. And then just a quick follow-up to Scott's question on production in Brazil. You mentioned at the Analyst Day you guys were building 2 trucks per day. What's your daily production rate today and have you seen progress since then towards the 10 per day?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. We've increased that to 3.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ted Grace from Susquehanna.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Two quick kind of cleanup questions. One, could you just comment on the impact of FX in the quarter both on OE side of the business in the Parts from a revenue and a profitability standpoint just so we appreciate what that dynamic was?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Ted, we're gathering the -- yes, the overall impact on revenues for the quarter compared to prior quarter was about $60 million and about $3 million of pretax profit impact from currency movements. And mostly due to the euro being stronger this year compared to last. You're interested in breaking it down between...","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just differentiating between truck and the Parts business to see if there was a -- just so I'd appreciate -- at the segment level, I had to think about it.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. I mean, for the quarter, for the truck side, the impact to currency was about $1 million and about $10 million on the revenue side.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then the balance would have gone to Parts?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. Pretty close to that. I mean, there are some other pieces there as well. But the Part side, there's some mixed things in there as well. The Parts' size is about $9 million on the revenue side and about $3 million on the market.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then the last thing, obviously, a strong quarter and you raised kind of your outlook for the market. Execution, very strong as we've come to expect with PACCAR a bit. Ron and Bob, when you sit back and think about kind of the concerns you have out there, whether they're within your control or outside your control, can you just maybe walk through the 1 or 2 items that consume that part of your day the most?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. The -- it's sort of business as usual. It's -- there's always challenges day to day, week to week. But the opportunities we continue to focus on investing in our business throughout the business cycle, continue to focus on rigorous cost control, continue to focus on managing our plant metrics, our warehouse capabilities so that we're prepared in the good markets, the challenging markets. And so we're just -- we'll just stay focused that they. It's how we operate our business and that's how we'll continue to approach it.","Ted Grace - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Absolutely. And it's a very rigid dividend. But said otherwise, there's no one kind of outstanding issue that's consuming more of your time than any other?","Ronald E. Armstrong","No. I'd say, at this point, nothing that stands out. That's a real challenge or that's a real opportunity. It's pretty steady, it's pretty focused in all facets of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Buckingham Research.","Jeffrey Asher Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I got to tell you, most of my questions have been answered by this point, so let me just throw one on the balance sheet. What level of cash do you like to keep optimally? You mentioned the dividend increase, you mentioned the share repurchase authorization, but you have reduced your capital spending, the R&D is coming down and you're sitting with roughly $2.6 billion of cash and marketable securities. What's the right level of cash to be sitting on?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I feel very comfortable with where we're at. Currently, you look back at history and the relationship of cash to our total balance sheet, where we're really sort of where we've historically been. And so we're quite comfortable with that. And as we said, we just upped our regular dividend payout and we'll continue to evaluate the opportunity for additional returns to shareholders in the forms of special dividends and\/or share buybacks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Wilhelm from Puget Sound.","Steve Wilhelm","This is actually Puget Sound, it's Steve Wilhelm. This is pretty much Renton focused. The 2 things I wanted to ask about in terms of the distribution center, could you say a little bit more about why you're doing it and how much it will cost? I mean, how many people it will employ and when it will be done?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well, we have a distribution center in Renton currently. It's about half the size of the proposed facility. And it's just -- the level of parts distribution activity in Northwest United States and Western Canada has increased, and so it's time to support that increased business activity. Our dealers continue to invest and reinvest in their businesses and add new locations. And so that increases the parts opportunity. So we won't see a significant change in employment levels because we -- just the distribution center employees will move from their current location to the new location. And as we continue to grow, there'll be some incremental employment as time goes on but it's not a significant amount of additional.","Steve Wilhelm","How many are there now and how much are you investing on this?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. I don't know those numbers right off the top of my head, Steve.","Steve Wilhelm","Okay. If I could find out later, that would be great. And then secondly, in terms of the -- well, all right, in terms of the Renton plant of the factory, what's the -- how many people are there and what's the status of production with the increases, in general? If I remember right, I thought you were building specialty trucks there mostly. And are you going to be building any long-haul trucks again or not, kind of what's -- where is that going?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Continue -- the folks in that plant continues to be specialty trucks. And just as we have done in our other facilities in North America, Renton is also being able to increase its build rates somewhat here during this period of strong order demand. So good for the Renton campus, our Renton campus group.","Steve Wilhelm","Could you -- well, you put a number on a couple in terms of Brazil. Could you say how many trucks you're producing a month or something? How much that's gone up and maybe how many people?","Ronald E. Armstrong","So again, I don't have all those details, but we can come back to you on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Raso from ISI Group.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the truck deliveries in Europe. Obviously, seasonally, we go down the third quarter, but just to have a better feel about how we're looking at the current order book and how you're thinking about deliveries for fourth quarter in Europe. Are we back above the 10,000 level for the fourth quarter? Just trying to think about extrapolation sequentially off what I'd suspect will be the bottom of the build schedule during this year's third quarter.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. Dave, we're -- we continue to be a build-to-order company. And if we get the orders, we will build them. We feel positive about the potential for additional trucks in the fourth quarter, but it's too soon to have a clear indication of whether that's the case or not.","David Raso - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess asked another way. I mean, earlier, the comment was -- was it, is it macro versus what's in the order book. I mean, can you give us some feel for orders on hand for the fourth quarter, just so we have an idea how much is macro, new orders, independent versus what's already there.","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes. It's just -- it's mostly macro. It's based on sort of economic trends and the opportunities that we see there. It's not the order book as it exists today.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ken Hastings","I'd like to thank everyone for their excellent questions. And thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for participating.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead.","Ken Hastings","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR\u2019s Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Bob Christensen, President and Chief Financial Officer and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller. As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media on the line, we ask that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning. PACCAR reported strong quarterly net income of $431 million for the third quarter of 2015. This is the second best quarter in the Company\u2019s 110 year history. Net income increased 16% compared to the third quarter last year. PACCAR\u2019s third quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4.9 billion. Gross margins for truck, parts and other operations were outstanding at 15.3%. These strong margins were the result of our great product line-up and rigorous cost control generating an 8.9% after tax return on revenues. This was the highest return on revenues achieved since the first quarter of 2007. I\u2019m very proud of our 24,500 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR delivered 39,400 trucks during the third quarter, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of last year.","The European economic and truck market outlook continues to improve. GDP growth expectations for this year are 2.6% in the UK, which is PACCAR\u2019s strongest market in the region, GDP growth is also accelerating on the continent. Freight transport activity on German highways is up 3% year-to-date compared to the same period last year. DAF truck registrations in the European above 16 tonne market are up 30% year-to-date compared to 20% growth for the market as a whole. We\u2019ve raised this year\u2019s 2015 forecast for Europe\u2019s greater than 16 tonne market to a range of 255,000 to 265,000 units. We expect the strong market conditions to extend into next year. Our 2016 forecast for Europe\u2019s heavy truck market is a range of 250,000 to 280,000 trucks. DAF has begun construction of $110 million cab paint facility in Westerlo, Belgium to support its future growth.","The U.S. economic picture is also positive with GDP forecast to grow 2.5% this year. The housing and automotive industries are bright spots in the economy and create a large amount of freight. Housing starts are projected to grow 13% this year to 1.1 million and the automotive industry is expected to deliver a near record 17.2 million vehicles. U.S. freight tonnage is at strong levels. Our estimate of retail sales for this year\u2019s U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market is a range of 275,000 to 285,000 units. For 2016, U.S. economists are forecasting 2.7% growth in GDP, 13% growth in housing starts and another year of strong sales in the automotive industry, all of which is positive for freight tonnage and truck sale. Next year should be another for the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry and be in a range of 240,000 to 270,000 units.","Gross margins in the fourth quarter for truck, parts and other forecast to be one half to one percentage point higher than last year's fourth quarter. PACCAR's global truck deliveries in the fourth quarter are estimated to be about 9% lower than the third quarter reflecting increased holidays and lower bill rates in North America. This is partially offset by more production days and high of higher bill rates in Europe.","PACCAR's parts business generated record revenues of over $2.3 billion and record pretax profits of $430 million for the first nine months of this year. Profit is a 17% increase, compared to the same period last year. The strong results were driven by economic growth and strong freight tonnage in the U.S. and Europe and the many innovative products and services offered by PACCAR parts and our dealers. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation parts revenues would have been up 8% or $173 million for the first nine months of this year. For the third quarter of 2015, PACCAR parts pretax profit of 145 million generated an excellent return on sales of 18.7%.","To support the growing demand for PACCAR in TRP branded parts, PACCAR parts will open a new 160,000 square foot distribution center in Renton Washington in the first half of next year. PACCAR financial services third quarter pretax income was $93 million, compared to $97 million earned a year ago. Excluding the effects of foreign currency translation profit would have increased $2 million for the quarter. The portfolio continues to grow and perform well.","PACCAR\u2019s strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the Company to continuously invest in new products and facilities. PACCAR recently announced a launch of the PACCAR MX-11 engine in North America early next year. PACCAR successfully launched the MX-11 in Europe two years ago and has installed over 10,000 MX-11 engines in DAF trucks. In addition PACCAR's engine factory in Columbus Mississippi celebrated the production of its 100,000 PACCAR MX-13 engine.","Capital expenditures for 2016 are projected to be $325 million to $375 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be 240 million to 270 million. These investments will further enhance our global product ranges, after market support and our manufacturing facilities. In the third quarter PACCAR repurchased 1.4 million share of Company's stock for $79 million. In September the PACCAR Board approved a repurchase of an additional $300 million of common stock. PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by developing the highest quality products and services in the industry.","Thank you and I\u2019ll be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","Just related to the 2% growth outlook in Europe for 2016, which market or markets within Europe do you think still have the most upside relative to replacement demand potential?","Ron Armstrong","Probably in terms of the growth percentage probably the southern markets would have the highest growth prospects just because they have been relatively low, so I think percentage wise that will be the case. Another opportunity for DAF is the Russian market which has been down a fair amount over the last couple years and there is obviously potential for that to grow with at a -- from a very low level currently this year.","Steven Fisher","And then on the buyback can you talk about how you decided on the $300 million number and whether you think there is any motivation there to make that materially larger and then potentially multiples of that number?","Ron Armstrong","Yes we have done 300 million over the last couple of times, it's a number of that we feel very comfortable with, provides a reasonable horizon and if we see the opportunity presents itself we\u2019ll authorize an additional amount above and beyond that to appropriate time.","Steven Fisher","Make sure where the stock is trading now is not -- that\u2019s not part of your thinking at the moment?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, we obviously have bought back shares during the quarter and with the additional authorization we have the capability to continue to buy shares as we go forward.","Operator","And then your next question will come from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Morgan Stanley.","Nicole DeBlase","So my first question for you is around the 4Q production outlook so within the 9% year-on-year decline, I am just curious how you might frame that within the U.S. and Canada versus Europe?","Ron Armstrong","So Europe will be up probably in the 30% to 35% range with the fact that we've got more production days and a higher daily build rate and offset by a similar percentage on the North American side reflecting increased holidays and lower build rates in North America.","Nicole DeBlase","And then my second question is with respect to what you guys are hearing from your customers we have had a few big fleets decided to cut their 2015 and 2016 CapEx outlook saying I know the market is super fragmented but I'm curious in particular about what you're hearing from your owner operator customers about their plans for spending next year in North America?","Ron Armstrong","I would say most of our discussions with our customers and mostly the large fleet customers, their expectations are to buy a similar number of trucks next year as they've purchased in 2015. I think we\u2019re seeing that in the code activity that's going on currently with Peterbilt and Kenworth and as well as the order intake that\u2019s coming in, so people are starting to make decisions about 2016 purchases.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, thanks. I'll pass it on.","Bob Christensen","Nicole I would add that we already have several of our large customer orders in the house. And those volumes are the same as our larger generally than last year.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could talk about the R&D budget for next year, obviously you've giving yourself room depending on end-market variability, but at the midpoint of the range is pretty good R&D growth within the context of mixed end-market outlook. Can you just talk about the potential programs that you're increasing spending on \u201916 versus \u201915 and then any additional color on U.S. versus Europe that you might be able to share?","Ron Armstrong","With so much of our product line up now is global in nature. I see next year being somewhat this year in terms of investing really across all elements of our products from continuing to enhance the individual component offerings within our various models at Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF. We continue to invest in our engine technology obviously we\u2019re launching the MX-11 in January in North America. And we've greenhouse gas requirements coming into play in 2017. So we\u2019ll continue to invest in our engine technology, our engine efficiency, the engines are performing excellently in the North American market and have for obviously 10 years in Europe. So we continue to invest in those areas as well as new systems and enhancements to our manufacturing capabilities.","Jerry Revich","And then I'm wondering if you might be able to share with us your book to bill in the quarter in Europe and separately in the U.S. or if not just maybe update us on how long your lead time spanned in the two regions?","Ron Armstrong","Europe the order intake for this quarter is up about 30% over where it was last year. So we've a good solid backlog for the fourth quarter and the result we\u2019re increasing the build rates. We've seen the industry orders in North America and that was reduced that window some and as a result we've adjusted build rates in North America accordingly.","Jerry Revich","And then lastly, obviously the concern is what the margin performance will look like if we get to the lower end of your outlook for U.S. and Canada next year. But can you just talk about structural differences we should think about in your business this cycle versus last. I guess your gross margins are certainly higher than what most people would have expected in this cycle. Can you just help us understand how we should think about decrementals et cetera if we get to the low-end of your retail sales outlook?","Ron Armstrong","I think it starts with the engineering of the product, and our engineers with the development of the 2.1 meter cabs, and those products for Peterbilt, and Kenworth and the Euro 6 products did a fantastic job of developing optimal designs with the balance of cost and performance for our customers. The manufacture building is excellent. So we\u2019re in great position from an operating standpoint and the products are performing very well in the marketplace. So we feel good about structurally our position in our factories. Our suppliers are performing well, and we\u2019re able to continue to make the 5% to 7% annual enhancement that is sort of our expectation for ongoing operating efficiency and overall operational improvements.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","A couple of questions, one, the margin performance in the quarter was impressive and in my opinion relative to where the sales came in. So can you talk about what the drivers were behind that? Was there any material cost benefit? What was the FX, how did FX impact the operating margin? And then I guess just my second question I know you said you are optimistic about 2016 based on what your large fleets customers are telling you. At the same time for the broader industry cancellations have picked up over the past three quarters relative to what you had see on a normalized basis. So have you seen anything like that is that part of the reason why you're taking your fourth quarter production down and is it just a function of people shifting delivery of trucks from the fourth quarter to 2016 or is it just orders going away at this point but you're confident that the customers will come back? Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Okay, I\u2019m just going to try and tackle all that; so the first part about margins Jamie was really a benefits of a lot of different areas. Obviously as I mentioned it starts with great product and pricing has been solid for us in the third quarter compared to where we\u2019ve been. So products continue to earn a premium in the marketplace, we are benefitting from somewhat lower material cost and commodity costs, we\u2019re seeing the benefits of operating efficiencies in our factories and the products are performing excellently in the marketplace and all those really come together to sort of generate the overall margin performance. In terms of cancellations, cancellations for us have just been very normal, I mean nothing to speak of that\u2019s different than what we would normally expect. And in terms of timing of deliveries obviously there was a large order intake in the fourth quarter of last year, first quarter of this year and now orders are being placed for 2016 and so I think there is a bit of a low in the build as we see it currently, but the prospects for 2016 are excellent.","Jamie Cook","And I am sorry, can you quantify the material cost benefit that you got in the quarter?","Ron Armstrong","I don\u2019t have those particular numbers Jamie, but it was a 10th or 2 of margin percent, I think.","Jamie Cook","And what got you the FX as well?","Ron Armstrong","So the FX we continue to benefit the resource are fair amount of our engine components that for North American build come from Europe and so we benefitted from that during the course of the quarter.","Jamie Cook","But you won\u2019t quantify the amount?","Ron Armstrong","I don\u2019t have that in front of me.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities.","Andy Casey","Ron I just wanted to go back to your comments about U.S., Canada truck 2016 order placement looking like it\u2019s good, does that suggest despite the production commentary that you gave earlier that we should kind of expect the positive change in order trends for the last three months of the year?","Ron Armstrong","I would say that would be the case, I mean orders for the third quarter are at a 17,000-18,000 a month, I think you\u2019ll see an increase in that. As I know certainly that the Peterbilt and Kenworth number should increase from what they saw in the third quarter.","Andy Casey","And then if we can go back to the question on the margin because clearly you're going to be -- you're anticipating mixed market conditions, next year you had a really good margin performance in third quarter within that though you had the aftermarket parts margin of 240 basis points year-on-year and it's remained above 18% for the really third consecutive quarter. What change is really driving that performance, is it structural or is it just pricing material like you kind of intimated?","Ron Armstrong","No I think it's more structural, obviously we just as we mentioned celebrated the production of our 100,000 MX engine in our Columbus engine factory. And so the population of MX engines continues to grow and we\u2019re seeing an increased percentage of MX engine part sales and other engine part sales in the market and that is beneficial. And our team has done a great job of putting together some really innovative programs and offerings and leveraging their cost structure for their parts warehouse. So it's a combination of a lot of different elements, but I\u2019d say that the increase in proprietary parts is a key part of it.","Andy Casey","And then last question it looks like you are projecting capital investments to go up in \u201916 versus \u201915 is that driven by the projects that you talked about in your monologue or are there\u2026?","Ron Armstrong","It is, it is so the -- we\u2019ve got the cab paint shop in Westerlo, we\u2019ve got some other plant projects at Chillicothe and in Denton we\u2019ve got the product projects with trucks and engines and then we\u2019ve got continuing to enhance our systems to be able to continue to move our business forward, so all those elements contribute to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Ross Gilardi","Yes just a couple of questions, just back on the Europe topic, clearly you\u2019ve seen a lot of strength in Europe year-to-date. But you're forecasting a pretty significant deceleration in 2016 and I am just wondering does that reflect what you are seeing in your order book now or is that just conservatism?","Ron Armstrong","If you look at that range of market that would be certainly the best market since 2008 and a top five market probably in the history of the European market, so it's quite a good market and we have expectations of 1.5% growth on the continent to continue strong growth in the U.K. We feel like that is our best estimate at this point we\u2019ll know more every time we report as we progress in the next year we will have better insight but we feel good about the European market and what it -- what the prospects are for next year.","Ross Gilardi","And then I am just wondering if you have seen anything in Europe, any type of change in order momentum or customer discussion in the aftermath of what's happened with VW in the auto space, and has that impacted really any of the just sort of the cadence of what's going on in Europe, and has it opened up any type of market share opportunity for you over the next 12 months?","Ron Armstrong","I would say that\u2019s been a nonevent from our market and our business perspective, it's a certainly related to the automotive but no effect on our business.","Ross Gilardi","And then I just want to make sure I understood on your comments before on your approach as North America when you talked about 35% production changes, were those year-on-year or sequential comments?","Ron Armstrong","Sequential, sequential.","Ross Gilardi","For both Europe and for North America\u2026","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Ross Gilardi","So Europe up 35, North America down 35?","Ron Armstrong","Yes.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.","Steve Volkmann","I am wondering if maybe I can push you a little bit on some other of the drivers for 2016 just to kindly get your thinking direction?","Ron Armstrong","Sure.","Steve Volkmann","Directionally I know you have put a lot of effort into bringing your parts distribution and all that is there any reason that parts business would not be up again next year?","Ron Armstrong","Yes I think it's a lot of it is economic driven it is the amount of freight tonnage, as I mentioned in my comments, freight tonnage in North America is strong, near record levels and the same is the case in Europe, we monitor the mouth statistics and other freight metrics in Europe and those are really almost also at near record levels. So as long as the freight movement is there, there is going to be a need to service and support the truck in keeping the uptime going, so we think with our innovative practices some of the things that our team does with other the fleet services program, some of the online programs that we can continue to grow our share of that aftermarket parts business as we progress through 2016.","Steve Volkmann","And then I don\u2019t know maybe similar comments on finance you are also I think penetrating a little more in that market?","Ron Armstrong","As is typical during a cycle when things get really good there is a lot more lenders that come into the market and think that they are going to be able to take advantage of that so we are in that particular phase and so we continue to focus on what we do very well, we have a great customer support mechanism, we are focused on serving the commercial vehicle business and our guys do a great job and we will continue to be in that 25% to 30% share of the finance market as we go forward.","Steve Volkmann","And then just finally on the MX engine I assume you would be expecting to sell more of those next year as a percentage total and maybe any thoughts on what types of volume the MX-11 might be able to drive?","Ron Armstrong","The MX-11 is not as prevalent in engine in the market as the MX as a 13 litre engine is but now we have our own engine that we can offer in that range and so that will add several percentage points to our PACCAR engine penetration as we get into the next year so I think in the near-term we\u2019d expect 40% to 50% of our engines to be PACCAR engines.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Patrick Nolan with Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan","Just a couple of follow-up questions, first on North American pricing in previous cycles as volumes started to come off from the peak, we saw pricing start to get weaker, what are your expectations for that as we go next year as the market starts to move more towards a trend a kind of demand level over the next couple of years?","Ron Armstrong","I think we are very comfortable with pricing being comparable to current levels, we are competitive in a marketplace, we got a great product and our products realize a fair price in the market and so I don\u2019t see any significant price movement in the near-term at all.","Patrick Nolan","And if I could just go back to the margin question again maybe ask it a different way. So if next year Europe will be up a bit that\u2019s more vertically integrated market so in theory the incrementals are better on that volume growth? And North America based on your guidance will be off a bit and then there is some cost savings on the gross margin line. Do you think that measures up to kind of a flattish gross margin next year? Or do you think gross margin would be down slightly if revenue declines a bit?","Ron Armstrong","I would say it will track volume a little bit, but I would say it would be flattish margin achievement next year compared to this year.","Patrick Nolan","And if I could just sneak one more in, what's your preliminary view on taxes next year as Europe becomes a bigger portion of the earnings?","Ron Armstrong","Michael you want to?","Michael Barkley","Yes we still expect the overall tax rate to be around 31%-32% depending on the extra earnings and other factors.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber","Most of the questions have asked already, but can you just comment on what you're feeling about dealer inventories. We've been hearing some chatter about inventories across the industry, maybe getting a little bit elevated, are you seeing that? Or have you heard anything to that effect?","Ron Armstrong","No, not at all, our dealers are typically PACCAR dealers have sort of the low industry average inventory levels and we\u2019re in that position currently and dealers are in great shape. So feel good about where we\u2019re at.","Seth Weber","And then just sorry going back to Europe again, I mean how much of the strength do you think is being driven by replacement demand versus I mean you mentioned the German the freight volumes want to -- is it, macro is getting better or is it just the age of the fleet is all then you haven't seen a cycle there. Do you have an opinion to that?","Ron Armstrong","I think it's a combination of both of those. Just like we saw in North America, there is a combination of some pent up demand as well as some capacity growth.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Neil Frohnapple with Longbow Research.","Neil Frohnapple","Could you just talk about used truck price in the North America? What are you seeing in the market we've heard some signs of deterioration in the last 30-60 days? Are you guys seeing anything something similar and just any color you can add there and how that will potentially impact the new truck sale side?","Ron Armstrong","Yes I don't see used truck pricing having a significant effect on the new truck sales levels. I would say as the third quarter pricing was comparable to what it was a year-ago but you're coming into a period now where there is going to be more trucks in the market and we\u2019ll see how that will develop as we progress in the coming quarters.","Neil Frohnapple","And then do you have an updated industry outlook for heavy duty industry registrations in the South American market. I think previously you have mentioned 70,000 to 80,000 for 2015 and just any initial thoughts on 2016?","Ron Armstrong","I'll let Bob talk to that. ","Bob Christensen","We think that 70 to 80 is a good measure for the balance of this year, and we\u2019ll probably experience a similar level of demand in 2016.","Neil Frohnapple","And then just one final housekeeping question. Of the 24,200 units in U.S. and Canada, do you have a specific breakdown by region in the quarter?","Ron Armstrong","Between U.S. and Canada?","Neil Frohnapple","Correct.","Ron Armstrong","I don't.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Joe Vruwink with Robert W. Baird.","Joe Vruwink","I wanted to go back to the earlier comment on what large fleets have been saying because I think other than Swift actually all that have made 2016 comment have actually said that they're continue to grow their fleets next year in addition to normal and some have even said accelerated replacement to get the average age down. So with that dynamic and then looking at your forecast for next year to get the retail sales decline in the industry, is the bridge between those two things? Maybe just a deceleration in fleet growth, so \u201915 was a very healthy year of expansion, next year is going to be good but just not as \u201915's level?","Ron Armstrong","I think that\u2019s a fair way to think about it. I think that is a -- because again our discussions have been that people are going to invest about what they've invested in 2015. So I think just the pace of maybe how they go about that maybe a little bit more even keeled because of the extraordinary higher order intake in the fourth quarter of \u201914 and the first quarter of \u201915.","Joe Vruwink","And then just based on your prior cycle experiences, it would seem to be unusual to have that sort of commentary from the large fleet, even though they are a small piece of the industry directionally they're helpful to get those comments and then expecting there has been whispers that volumes are down 15%-20% next year that just seems to two great of a disconnect. Would you generally agree with that view?","Ron Armstrong","Our thoughts are as long as the economy is in that 2% to 3% growth and there is continued strong housing and automotive activity and consumer spending is up 3% or 4% year-on-year, I think the fundamentals of the economy and therefore the effects on the our business I think are all good. So I would agree that 15% to 20% is probably overly pessimistic.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter withPiper Jaffray.","Alex Potter","I was wondering if you can comment I guess just give an update on Brazil obviously, macro down there it seems like things are pretty much coming apart of the themes but less of the material issue for you guys since you're growing off a non-existent base. But I guess just maybe an update on how volumes are ramping down there I guess dealer development and then maybe South America more broadly speaking as well?","Ron Armstrong","Yes I feel very good about the progression our team has made, our team is very solid, we just recognized as having one of the top truck models in the marketplace and yes the market is difficult market, but our team is growing and establishing the footprint and doing all the things necessary to position us for long-term growth in that market. Bob do you have other things to add?","Bob Christensen","We\u2019re continuing to add dealers even in a very difficult market. They are continuing to invest in their footprint. We will be introducing some new truck models at the large South American truck filled FENATRAN next month. Our production volume is small, but it is growing slightly and the fundamentals in Brazil are difficult right now, but the long-term fundamentals for trucking are very good.","Alex Potter","And then I guess one question on the truck cycle in North America then I\u2019ll pass it on. Shifting specifically to medium duty there has been some commentary regarding I guess sustained power of the medium duty market maybe not getting whipped around as much as the heavy duty market. Would you say that that\u2019s generally consistent with the way you guys are viewing things looking into 2016?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think that traditionally has been the case and I think that\u2019s how we think about as we go forward that the ups and downs of that market typically are a little more muted than the heavy duty segment.","Operator","The next question will come from the line of Robert Wertheimer with Barclays.","Robert Wertheimer","A quick question for you I mean you gave some detail on 11 liter which seems to be very successful in Europe. Do you happen to have the current mix has it reached its natural level in Europe or is it still growing and the potential for the U.S. is a follow through?","Ron Armstrong","Yes so I think it hasn\u2019t reached the total potential in Europe I think there as time goes on and greenhouse gas requirements and fuel efficiency expectations increase. We\u2019ll see more and more downsizing the MX 11 has capability to go up to 430 horsepower and 1,550 foot pounds of torque. So it's a very capable engine, the customers that are using it in Europe are very satisfied with the capabilities and I think we will continue to see a migration to a higher percentage. And it's about 25%-30% of DAF\u2019s build at this point. And we\u2019ll ramp that up in North America as we go and I think as more customers experience its capability. You\u2019ll see just like we\u2019ve seen with the MX 13, we\u2019ll see a progression of more and more customers taking that engine on so.","Robert Wertheimer","Perfect, is that solely on sale in 1Q or is it going to be a staged ramp?","Ron Armstrong","No it will be a ramp-up during the course of next year.","Robert Wertheimer","And then if I can ask one more, in Europe could you speak to your share, your share gains is that geographic more or is it gaining penetration in truck versus tractor you think for a long time or is it maybe if you could give us any color on that? Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Yes I think it's really across almost all the markets 2014 was impacted by the Euro 5 pre-buy which was really across most of the geographies and so we\u2019ve seen a recovery this year across all they almost were up about one percentage point across the breadth of Europe and we\u2019ve seen similar progression in most countries.","Operator","And the next question will come from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research.","Joe O'Dea","First it looks like you did take build down in September in Class 8 for U.S. and Canada. So just whether or not that fully now reflects your expectation for what both build rate should be at into the end of the year or if there is a little bit more work to do on taking build lower?","Ron Armstrong","No, I think we\u2019ve adjusted build rates to where we think they need to be and we would anticipate based on where we\u2019re at today that that will be how we\u2019ll start next year.","Joe O'Dea","And then also on North America and within location you\u2019ve previously talked about having very strong share within that market, the order trends within Class 8 straight have been softer recently and so if you could just talk to whether or not that has affected some of the applications that you go into or a few more protected from it and then your kind of outlook for how that should trend moving forward if we get some relief from some of that softness?","Ron Armstrong","Some of that order trend that you refer to is seasonality. We have two new models one on the Kenworth side and one on the Peterbilt side that are doing very well, the 567 and the T880 and we would anticipate that we would have another strong construction season upcoming.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ted Grace with Susquehanna.","Ted Grace","I was hoping to dig into the parts business a little more and follow-up on some Steve's questions, could you walk through regionally how that business performed and also give us a sense for what the impact of FX was in the quarter?","Ron Armstrong","So the in the terms of the performance regionally both North America and Europe participated in about 7% to 8% growth year-on-year for the year-to-date period so they both have done very well with their programs to get a greater share of the market and take advantage of the strong freight market, so I\u2019ll let Michael talk to the exchange rate effects.","Michael Barkley","The impact on parts revenues for the quarter was $50 million and for the year-to-date figures $155 million it has been running about that $50 million pace during\u2026","Ted Grace","Any impact on profits?","Ron Armstrong","The impact on profit for the quarter was pretax income impact was about $10 million.","Ted Grace","Okay can you remind us what is year-to-date?","Ron Armstrong","And year-to-date would be about $30 million.","Ted Grace","Okay.","Ron Armstrong","And about a 10 million a quarter pace. That will diminish of course as we enter into different comparatives going into '16 with exchange rates have been relatively stable at these low levels for the past few months.","Ted Grace","And I think as we just think about the growth, I know you said it has been pretty even between North America and Europe, can you talk about it and largely on economic and freight volume driven but can you talk about how we should think about maybe the underlying growth versus some of the company specific initiatives to take share whether that\u2019s more store growth or the DC initiatives, et cetera just so we get a sense for what the underlying because obviously freight volumes are growing at high single-digits so just trying to understand that dynamic?","Ron Armstrong","Lot of facet to that obviously, first of all we continue to invest in new distribution capability or expanded distribution capability we have built the new warehouse in Eindhoven and we recently expanded our racking capability in our Budapest warehouse, we doubled the size of our Lancaster warehouse, we\u2019re essentially doubling the capacity in the Pacific North West here with the new PDC and renting, so we are continually investing to provide that best-in-class service for our dealers and customers.","One of the things that we have done and we talk about it in the press release is we have opened TRP stores -- TRP standalone stores to really support the TRP brand and gain greater access to the second and third owner to the all mix trucks as well as the buses, trailers et cetera. And then our dealers have added lots of locations in North America and Europe to increase the penetration and the presence of their businesses and we are seeing the benefit of that as well, so it's -- and then you add on the additional initiatives the programs that our parts team have put together all those things together are supporting that 8% growth.","Ted Grace","And then the last thing if I could just sneak it in a follow up to question Jamie had about pricing I know you made the comment that pricing overall was solid, could you actually speak to pricing in the U.S. versus Europe and are you seeing any signs or isolated pockets of pricing weakness in Europe?","Ron Armstrong","No, pricing in both markets I say is very solid. With again the markets as we see them currently are top five markets and our products are performing well they have got a lot to offer a customer in terms of efficiency and low operating cost and so we are seeing good solid pricing with our products.","Ted Grace","Okay, I am thinking more from the standpoint of competitors, from select competitors than from progressive?","Ron Armstrong","I guess it's typical business I mean we have business that we think is very important to us and another OEMs have business they think it's important to them and so that\u2019s just normal I would say it's all normal marketplace behaviour that we see in both North America and Europe.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Mike Shlisky with Seaport Global Securities.","Mike Shlisky","So I wanted to touch back on your Class 5 to 7 share during the quarter, looked pretty solid, I kind of wonder if you can give us kind of color as to perhaps were there any kind of products in the end-market that did better than others in the quarter or any initiatives that you guys took in the quarter to kind of gain some additional share there?","Ron Armstrong","No nothing I think as time goes on more and more our dealers appreciate what that product can do for their customers. And we continue to see those products perform very well and they just continue to get a growing share of that Class 5 to 7 market.","Mike Shlisky","And then secondly I also just want to ask about the upcoming new paint facility over in Europe, is paint currently a pinch point for production or for margins, and can we expect the opening of the facility to perhaps unlock some kind of volume upside either in '16 or possibly in '17?","Ron Armstrong","As we look out for DAF\u2019s growth expectations. We've talked before about medium-term targeting a 20% share of the European market and we need more capacity in our paint operations in addition to giving us the capacity obviously it will be state-of-the-art very environmentally friendly and really provide some good efficiencies and qualitative performance that we\u2019ll enjoy for years to come.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan.","Ann Duignan","I think most of my questions have been answered by now, but I just want to circle back couple of things. The MX 11 engine that will replace or compete with your current medium-duty engine which if I recall correctly is built by Cummins is that correct?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it will compete with Cummins\u2019 offering. I mean we will basically just replace the offering from Cummins.","Ann Duignan","Yes I just wanted to make sure that because I think Cummins builds it for you but you brand it, don't you?","Ron Armstrong","Well we have a 9 litre that we buy from them that is branded, and we\u2019ll continue to buy that 9 litre. But we also buy some 11-12 litre engines from them that this would essentially replace.","Ann Duignan","And then if we look at orders over the last three months, Canada and export orders have been down significantly, Canada down more than 50% export orders down 70% plus. Can you talk about those markets as you head into 2016 and how divergent those might be versus your outlook for the U.S.?","Ron Armstrong","I think the Canadian order levels have been impacted obviously more by oil and gas, I think than what we've seen elsewhere, so obviously lower oil and gas prices are very positive for almost all of our customers but there are some regions that get impacted by the lower oil and gas prices and so Canada is one of those areas that have seen that but the rest of the Canadian operations and fleet activities that is very good. Export I would say that those markets are down compared to where they have been and Bob talked about some of the South American markets 70,000 to 80,000 probably more normal range would be 100,000 trucks or so per year.","Ann Duignan","And you have baked those two markets into your outlook that you have given us today. I mean you're not expecting those to get any better or?","Ron Armstrong","No, they are just part of the, it is very similar yes.","Operator","At this time there are no further questions. I'll turn the conference call back over to Mr. Hastings for closing remarks.","Ken Hastings","Thank you. I would like to thank everyone for their excellent questions. And thank you operator.","Operator","Once again we'd like to thank you for your participation on today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. And if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are: Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; Bob Christensen, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","[Operator Instructions] Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2013. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $3.9 billion and quarterly net income was $236 million, an after-tax return on revenues of 6%.","I'm proud of our 21,700 employees, who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide. PACCAR's first quarter truck segment results reflect lower industry truck sales in North America due to slower economic growth. Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada were 45,000 units in the first quarter this year compared to 54,000 in the first quarter last year.","Customer truck purchases are focused primarily on replacement vehicles for their fleets. PACCAR delivered 30,500 trucks during the quarter, in line with our projections. PACCAR generated steady aftermarket parts and service revenues and strong PACCAR Financial results during the first quarter. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 210,000 to 240,000 units this year. In Europe, the greater than 16-tonne truck market is projected to be in the range of 210,000 to 235,000 units compared to 222,000 units sold last year.","Looking forward, PACCAR truck deliveries in the second quarter are expected to increase 5% to 10% compared to the first quarter. Second quarter gross margins should be similar to the first quarter. It's encouraging to note that housing starts in the U.S. are projected to be over 1 million units this year and there is some growth in nonresidential construction. Other good economic news is that North American auto production is expected to be 15 million vehicles or higher this year. These positive trends should benefit truck demand. In fact, freight tonnage in the U.S. is at the highest level in 10 years. That's good news. These indicators have translated into many dealers and customers earning record results in 2012.","Turning to Europe. Freight in Germany, as measured by truck miles driven, continued at levels comparable to last year. DAF truck orders in Europe have increased 29% compared to a year ago. And we're beginning to have some customers, particularly in the U.K., accelerate purchases of Euro 5 vehicles ahead of the introduction of Euro 6 emission requirements next year.","PACCAR's strong balance sheet and positive cash flow have enabled the company to invest over $1.5 billion in new products and services in the last 2 years. Last year, PACCAR launched the Kenworth T680, the Peterbilt Model 579 and the DAF XF Euro 6. These new products have received excellent reviews from customers, dealers and industry experts for their innovative design, high quality and fuel efficiency. This year, PACCAR has complemented these on-highway trucks by launching new vocational trucks: the Kenworth T880, the Peterbilt Model 567 and the DAF CF and LF Euro 6. And I think it's important to note that PACCAR has the newest and most modern vehicle range in the industry.","I think all of these new products will certainly benefit our customers; fuel-efficient, ergonomic vehicles begin to go into production. Very exciting. In addition, PACCAR has expanded its range of proprietary engines with the introduction of the updated PACCAR MX-13 and the new PACCAR MX-11 engine. The PACCAR MX-11 engine will begin production at DAF in the fall of this year and is planned to be available in Kenworth and Peterbilt vehicles in 2015.","PACCAR's global business initiatives are making excellent progress. Capital spending this year is estimated to be $400 million to $500 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be $250 million to $275 million. Construction of the new DAF assembly factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil is on schedule and is expected to begin production in late 2013.","PACCAR Financial Services revenue were $293 million in the first quarter compared to $261 million in the prior year. PACCAR Financial's first quarter pretax income was $80 million compared to $71 million earned last year. This is the best first quarter in PACCAR Financial history and the second-best quarter ever for PACCAR Financial. The excellent results benefited from growth in portfolio balances, lower borrowing cost and used truck prices that have increased 75% in the last 3 years.","In summary, PACCAR is enhancing its leadership position in the global truck market by launching the highest-quality products and services in the industry and by investing in new geographic regions. Thank you. And I'll be pleased to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I was intrigued by the up 5% to 10% quarter-over-quarter delivery comment that you made. Could you update us on the European market conditions, especially related to orders? Current market condition is obviously a little rough. But one of your competitors talked about a low double-digit order improvement in the first quarter. Have you seen something like that?","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. DAF continues to do very, very well. We've seen orders year-on-year in Europe, up about 29% in Europe. I think some of our competitors may have had some numbers that reflect some increased orders, but those might be worldwide numbers. So the numbers for DAF are Europe.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's great to hear. And then a few questions on the R&D expense. The 2013 outlook increased modestly obviously. What drove the increase? And then secondly, given that you realized about 30% of the new expense range midpoint in the first quarter, how do you anticipate the R&D is going to be allocated by quarter? Is it evenly? Or does it progressively get lower as the year goes along?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. That's a good question. We're very excited and our customers and dealers are excited about all the new products. The biggest product launch, I think, in our history if you go back over the last few years, so there was a lot of R&D associated with that. And we still have plenty of R&D with new engines that are being launched and still some new options and variations on the new products that are being launched. But I think over the course of this year, R&D will gradually tail off.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just back on Europe. So you've seen a nice uptick in orders, it sounds like, but you've taken your industry forecast down a little bit this year. So could you just talk about the dynamic there a bit?","Mark C. Pigott","Right. Well, we've got some orders coming in. I mentioned briefly that we're starting to see some Euro 5, I guess, you could call it prebuy orders. There's many countries have different cutover dates in terms of being able to purchase or produce Euro 5 versus Euro 6. We just had a very successful show in Birmingham, the U.K., where we launched the new CF and LF and that generated a lot of interest and a lot of orders from our customers there. We'll just have to see what happens as the year progresses. But I think customers are starting to realize that there are some benefits to Euro 6, but it will be at a higher cost of EUR 10,000 to EUR 15,000. So some of them are saying it might be worthwhile purchasing Euro 5 vehicles this year, and that's -- now we're coming up to May. People are saying, \"I need to start making those decisions.\" So I think for the total year, Europe has obviously got some challenges, just as a general eurozone economy. But I think if it's comparable to last year, it would be a pretty good year in Europe.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then the detail you provided on parts versus trucks, and so forth was very helpful in your parts margins, I think you came in around 14.3%. Can you talk a little bit about where that has been historically and where you think it can go? And do you see any revenue acceleration or cost impact in the parts business as you open up your new Parts Distribution Centers in several locations?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well, we appreciate it. We're trying to keep giving the good information so that you and your peers can make good decisions, so thanks for the feedback. I think parts margins have probably improved a little bit as we've gotten more proprietary products out there. And certainly, we're pushing that in North America. And Europe's probably had more proprietary with their own axle and engine for many more years. But I think in terms of products that we're bringing to the market for our customers, we're trying to do a better job of sourcing. I think margins are going to be sort of in line with where they are now. Certainly, as we add new distribution centers, we're looking for some growth in our sales, particularly as we get into new markets, like South America. But just continue to achieve some improved efficiencies in the way we're processing the logistics of the orders of the entire parts operations. So we've got a very talented team in Parts, keep coming up with new ideas and new products to sell and new services to offer our customers. So I think it looks very bright, very good future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Mark, PACCAR at Mid-America talked about a pickup in vocational trucks, which do tend to carry higher margins. Maybe you can update us on that improvement. Have you seen it continue? You mentioned a little bit in your release. But do you expect that improvement to be reflected in your margins? Is it already? Or is it coming still?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the Kenworth and Peterbilt team, I think, have done a very good job. The new products they just introduced with the 880 and 567 seemed to be timed pretty well as we see that the housing starts, particularly in the U.S., increasing, getting back to some, let's call it, closer to replacement levels on housing starts. Peterbilt and Kenworth have over 40% market share of the vocational market, which is good. And vocational is probably about 20%, 25%, maybe 30% of the total market. That could improve as we see more construction going on. It does tend to have a little bit better margin. I don't think it's going to have a significant impact on this year. But I think certainly the Kenworth and Peterbilt team are well poised with their new products to continue to do very well in that marketplace.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Mark, that's very helpful. And then let me just shift gears. One of the biggest deltas, at least versus our expectations, continues to be in the regions outside of North America and Europe. So maybe you could talk about when we might see stabilization. You talked a little bit last quarter about countries like Colombia, Mexico, Australia. What are we seeing in these regions? And are we going to stabilize in these regions?","Mark C. Pigott","The Mexico market is actually reasonably steady. Colombia had a large infrastructure investment with their pipelines that's been completed. But they're now looking at other infrastructure development. Of course, the big area that we're focused on is getting our plant in Brazil up and running. I was just there a week or so ago with the team and very encouraged. We're planning to be building DAF Trucks there later this year. And Brazil, as we've talked I think in previous calls, continues to have very good margins for manufacturers. And many of our competitors generate a sizable portion of their profits from Brazil. I think maybe 1 or 2, that's the only place they make money. So we're looking forward to being in that marketplace. We're coming in as a premium product. Certainly, everybody knows what we offer. We have a great range of DAF Trucks. We've got many dealers that are investing in new facilities, and it's very exciting. But it'll take time. We're just starting out this year slowly, and we'll grow over time. So I think that'll be a good benefit for PACCAR. Australia is an important market, it's a smaller market. And we tend to be the market leader there. It's been fairly, fairly stable. And then over to Asia, big markets but not a lot of money being made there, but important markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Talking about Brazil, can you talk a little bit, Mark, about what you would expect the competition to do? I mean, the competition is just not going to allow DAF to come along and take market share away, particularly given the sizable margins in the region. How have you seen the competition react previously when you've brought out new products or tried to gain share? I know Brazil is unique. But maybe you could talk about what the competitive reaction might be.","Mark C. Pigott","We compete against an excellent group of competitors in the marketplace. I'm sure that they're having their own calls. And I know that you're very thorough, so I'm sure you're asking them those very same questions. So I don't want to jump ahead of what they're saying. I think the good news for the Brazil market is that DAF is the premium-value, high-quality product. All of our competitors know that. It's a relatively small world that we compete in. We know the competitors, they know us. And unlike some new competitors under Brazil, who are very interested in just gaining share and getting a foothold at a very low price, we're going to come in and offer our customers a wonderful value with a great product that's going to deliver for them in terms of efficiency and helping their operations be profitable. So I'm sure that the competitors are continuing to make their investments in their facilities, in their products, in their dealerships just as we are also. So it's pretty similar anywhere in the world. But I think, Ann, to your point that what we're going -- we're coming in as the premium, and that's what we've done over 108 years now around the world. So I think that is probably relatively good news for our competitors.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I do appreciate the color. And then back to Europe -- Euro 5, Euro 6. I mean, in a way, the worst thing we could see this year is prebuying because it will just come out of next year. Can you talk a little bit, Mark, about -- are your dealers tempted to prebuy also and store some of these or carry an inventory of some of these Euro 5s as well as your end fleet customers? Can you just talk about the mix there a little bit?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. First of all, of course, like everybody, we have dealer meetings on an ongoing basis, and our dealers are probably in the best shape they've been in for my 35 years. They are great facilities. They're making excellent returns. They've got strong teams. And of course, as an OEM, we're supplying them with wonderful new trucks and services and Financial Services. So the dealers are doing well, their inventory, I think, generally is probably at the mid- to the low state. So they're in great shape that way. In terms of Euro 5, there are different guidelines by country, so dealers are not really able to store vehicles. They have to abide by the requirements of each country. So I think it's really going to be driven more by the customers. The customers know that they either have to put in service or have to purchase Euro 5 vehicles by a certain time and each country has their own guidelines on that. So dealers are doing well.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what about used equipment when we switch to Euro 6? I mean, I've heard some dealers talk about the fact that 50% of their used equipment goes to regions of the world where ultra-low sulfur diesel is not available. Would that be similar for DAF dealers, that a significant number of used trucks end up in countries where no ultra-low sulfur diesel is available?","Mark C. Pigott","I think a few years ago, there's probably more of a trend towards that. But you look at countries, like Russia. They want to have good, new products operating, meeting whatever their latest Euro emission requirements are. So I think Used Trucks will be good if you -- next year, if you want to buy a truck and there's a Euro 5, that's going to command a pretty good price. So used trucks really have had a strong growth over the last 3 years, as I mentioned in my comments. And we're producing the best trucks we've ever had in our history. So I think the customers and the dealers really appreciate that. Used trucks is a very, very good business right now, very good.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I bet, if it's a Euro 5.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you'd just talk about the plan for PACCAR Financial in Brazil. At which point do you ramp up the Financial Services subsidiary in the region?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Sure, you bet. Just as we do around the world, Jerry, as our volumes grow in various markets, we make decisions at various points in time to supplement our business with a finance operation, and we'll follow that same practice in Brazil. As the volumes grow, we'll decide at the appropriate point where there's enough volume to support a standalone finance operation. And we'll work closely with banks in Brazil to support our operations and make sure that our customers have the best financing options available.","Mark C. Pigott","And I think picking up on that, Brazil has some guidelines in terms of local content, in terms of weight and value, about 60%, that allows you to qualify for some national financing programs. And most of our competitors do that. We certainly plan to be part of that program, which is a good advantage for our customers and our dealers. So that's what we'll be doing. As Ron mentioned, working with -- there's a couple of major banks in Brazil. They're very good banks. We'll work with them and structure a program to enable our customers to have a competitive financing program just like the competitors have.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And switching gears to Europe market, can you just put the order growth comment into perspective for us? Can you talk about what the book-to-bill was in the quarter for DAF in Europe or talk about how much the backlog grew in the quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","I think that the -- well, the backlog year-on-year is about the same for DAF. And we're finding pretty steady order intake right now, which allows us to have pretty steady production. As I mentioned, we're starting to see the early signs of -- I call it --  you can call it a prebuy or just people buying more trucks is another way of looking at it, starting in the U.K. That may, over the next few months, begin to filter out to different countries on the continent. So I think we're in pretty good shape.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And in terms of what you're hearing on the incentives side to, I guess, mute the impact of prebuy, it sounds like Germany and Poland are considering some toll road incentives there. Can you just talk about what you're seeing across the region and how you think that plays out?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well, I think each country is evaluating whether there is an incentive to purchase Euro 6, whether it's a straight-out incentive or a lower tax or something on the toll road. So there's a lot of different ways to approach it, and each country has their own guideline and their own governing body that's going to determine that. And that's beginning to take shape. But I think it's still going to be a couple more months before we really get it clarified for all of Europe. But I think Europe, probably more than North America, tries to have incentives to direct customers to partake of the latest environmental-improved vehicles. We see that. We've seen that a number of times, whether it's Euro 4, Euro 5 and now Euro 6.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, I'm wondering if you could talk about pricing conditions on order activity today compared to what you're shipping out of backlog in North America and Europe. Any meaningful changes in the landscape?","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think pricing has been pretty steady over the last 3 to 6 months. Obviously, we're very excited about these new products that we're launching and the new engines we're launching that hopefully will continue to contribute to good margins and maybe even slightly enhanced margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you talk about why the penetration in the U.S. with the PACCAR engine is still kind of low? I know that when you first introduced it, you were hoping to get it up to 50-50 over a reasonable period of time. And it still seems kind of below that.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, it's at 30%, and we're seeing some good, particularly good growth this year. I think what we've been able to do and dealers are very excited about it, is we launched these new truck products, and there's been a lot of it, you've seen it in the press release, a number of those truck models are tailored to have the PACCAR engine in it, which I think the customers will find very advantageous. So we're excited about it. Yes, we're at 30% share, and we feel very confident that, that will grow and perhaps even accelerate over the near and medium term as these new truck models come out that have been designed for the PACCAR engine. So a lot of good work being done by our engineering teams.","Joel Gifford Tiss - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And can you give us some -- a little bit of a framework on margin impact from all the initiatives you've had? Launching new products is obviously very expensive and opening your factory in Brazil. So as we go into '14 and '15, can you give us a sense of how much drag there has been on the operating margins in the last 2 years from all these initiatives?","Mark C. Pigott","I mean, I think that the ramp-up, we've continued to add additional people in Brazil as we've started factory construction. We just added our first line supervisors to our team. We've had the executive team in place for quite some time. So we'll continue to see that as -- build as it gets closer to building our first trucks in the fourth quarter. So it's been a negative effect. But I wouldn't say it's a sizable impact on our operation.","Robert J. Christensen","I would say the same thing for the introduction of the new product. You see some small increase in our R&D levels, which we expect to plateau and go down during the course of the year. But it's rather small in terms of impact on margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a little bit of a clarification, I guess. Mark, you had mentioned sequentially, you thought production could be up 5% to 10%, and then I think you said gross margins, essentially flat. And I guess, I would expect some sort of volume benefit in your gross margin, if you had that much sequential increase in production. So I'm wondering, is there sort of an offset there we should be thinking about? Or are you being perhaps a bit conservative? What's the right way to look at that?","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think we're being -- that's the way we look at it. Obviously, we've got a -- we take on some people as we increase production, working with some of our suppliers to make sure that everybody can increase their production. I think there continues to be, just in the marketplace, people are looking for the best package they can get in terms of pricing. Our customers, as I mentioned, are doing well. But they're not expanding their fleets. It's more of a replacement. So everybody is still very conservative and cautious in terms of the amount of pricing that they're willing to allow an OEM to increase. The marketplace, as I've shared, is similar to last year. Last year was a good year for PACCAR. But our customers, our dealers are saying, \"Okay, we're seeing some good things, but every day, there's sort of challenges out there.\" So I think we'll produce more and we're looking forward to that. But I don't think the margins that we're selling to our customers is necessarily going up at the same rate.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then maybe just quickly on the MX-11 engine, can you sort of lay out your expectations for that product over the next year or 2 in terms of, I don't know, volumes or penetration? Or how should we think about that opportunity?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, sure. That's a good question. Of course, the MX-11 is really going to be going into our DAF product first, and we'll bring it into North America in 2015, which is a number of years from now. And we look for the MX-11 over time to be 20%, 30% of our volume in Europe. It's a very exciting product. It's got great torque and great horsepower in a smaller package, which is really the trend we're seeing around the world. And of course, in North America, as we've talked over the last 12, 18 months, the 13-liter is essentially the same volume now as the 15-liter on a general industry level. And the 11-liter in Europe will probably take some of the business from the 13-liter in Europe, as people are saying, \"I can get 400 horsepower and strong torque, and that's all I need to move my products around.\" So we're excited about it. It's one of the first all-new engines that have been unveiled to the industry by any competitor for a long time. So it's very exciting.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And can you make that product in Mississippi as well?","Mark C. Pigott","In fact, we're making about 1\/2 of it in Mississippi. So between our 2 engine factories in Holland and Mississippi, there's a great collaboration and sort of best practices as we do a lot of benchmarking. So they make about 1\/2 of it there and ship it to Holland.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. At Mid-America Truck Show, it was mentioned that some of the dealers, I think, in particular Peterbilt dealers, inventory levels were cited in some instances as too low. Can you talk about how you're feeling about dealer inventory levels both at Peterbilt and Kenworth? And then I guess, my second question, on the margin side, I think last quarter, you said for the full year you expect margins to be about flat. Is that still your expectation with R&D coming up modestly? And then my third question, I guess, is you've done an impressive job gaining market share in North America. I mean, do you assume you can hold that share this year just with sort of the competitive dynamics changing a little that we could take a step backward before we move forward or hold share?","Mark C. Pigott","Three great questions. First, it was a good show at Mid-America. And the dealers' inventory is in terrific shape if you're a dealer. They're doing well. I think that they recognize that the market, particularly for vocational, we're seeing a bump in that. They'll probably bring some more stock on. But dealer inventory, as I say, is probably in the best shape it's been for years. So they're very comfortable. And I think they'll begin to increase their inventory modestly. In terms of margins, yes, we still expect it to be relatively comparable to last year. I don't see a lot of changes on that. R&D will begin to decline, as I mentioned earlier. We've got -- we've come out with a lot of new products and a lot of those programs are starting to wrap up. Obviously, some new programs will take their place. But I think you'll see that decline. And then in terms of market share, it was a record market share last year. We've never been market share-driven. We think the market share will probably be comparable to last year. But what we're excited about is coming out with all these new products and just enhancing our dealers' and our customers' business with great new products. So market share; different competitors are at different cycles in their business. We've seen that for many, many decades. And I think our market share will be sort of in line with last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Crawford from UBS.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse, but I'm still trying to understand the lower outlook in Europe. What drove the reduction? And I'm curious, actually you mentioned steady order intake right now. But I'm curious how the cadence of orders trended for DAF in the quarter.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think the cadence was pretty steady. As I say, we had a good show in Birmingham. I don't know if you were there or not. But of course, launching of the new products and with some of the U.K. regulations and guidelines on Euro 5, Euro 6 that got people's attention. And DAF in the U.K. has been the market share leader. We've got a great team there. So that's generating a lot of very positive business for us. I think in Europe, you read the press as well as we do, it's just -- many countries are in a recession. There's certainly challenges. Freight overall is flat, certainly in Germany, which has a very good program in terms of being able to track freight. You compare that to the freight in North America, which is at a 10-year high, a big difference. Obviously, customers carry the freight. That's what drives their business. And I think there could be -- if there's a prebuy, that may be good for the first 3 quarters or so, but there might be a slowing in the fourth quarter. So I think it's just being conservative and trying to reflect the ongoing eurozone business conditions is really what we're looking at.","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Assuming retail sales do come in at the middle of that range, flat year-over-year, what kind of delta should we expect in terms of your production? Are you going to be overproducing, underproducing?","Mark C. Pigott","You're talking about for Europe now?","Eric Crawford - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, of course, one of the great things about working for PACCAR is we only produce what we have orders for. So I never really think of it any other way. So we vary our production levels to reflect incoming order rates. And right now, DAF's been pretty steady on their build rates for about 17, 18 months now. And we've got a very good team out there getting the orders. And market share is pretty much in line with what it was last year. So we'll see what happens.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just going back to the second quarter delivery target, up 5% to 10% sequentially, can you give us any more details on how that breaks down U.S. versus Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. I think it'll probably be about 2\/3 in North America and about 1\/3 in Europe.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the 29% increase in orders for DAF year-over-year, can you give us any color on what that did sequentially? I mean, was there something unusually soft in the prior year quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","No, I think a year ago, the orders were actually pretty good. And what I see is we've been able to benefit this quarter, the first quarter of 2013 with some strong order intake, particularly in the U.K., really surrounding the exciting launch of the new CF and LF at the Birmingham show. I think that stimulated some good orders in the last month or so.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So orders were up from the fourth quarter to the first quarter then?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. They were -- well, they were actually -- they were up a little bit on sort of the medium side and relatively flat on the heavies.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I was surprised to see the Parts sales number down for the quarter year-over-year. Is that -- is there something going on there? I mean, I think it was up 3%, 4% or so last year. Is this just kind of a hiccup here?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, they've been on a -- Parts has just done a marvelous job. They've had such strong growth over the last 10 years that I think people are just having a little bit of a breather. They keep coming out with wonderful, new programs. And we just had dealer meetings in the last month or so. They're still excited about it. I think most of that, probably the parts impact was in Europe. The dealers being just a little bit conservative about the parts and obviously a little bit of maybe slower servicing side also at the dealerships. And servicing is usually the biggest customer of Parts for either business. So just once again, Europe, just a little bit conservative that way, a little bit slower.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Let's see here. So I was wondering if -- you talked a lot about the vertical integration and the integration of the MX engine obviously into your products. I was wondering if it's possible to quantify a fuel economy benefit that you might be able to articulate to customers when you're pitching that as kind of a packaged product as opposed to using outside engines.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we have several benefits using our engine. Typically, they have a couple percent improvement on fuel economy, but they're also lighter. And as I say with the new products, we've been able to package them in a smaller hood. So you have a little lower profile of the vehicle. And of course, we're excited about our own engine. We think it's got great reliability. It's very quiet, easy to drive. And so it's something that we've been working on for 50 years, great driving experience. And I think that really sort of sums it up.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Then there's, I guess, one other question. I was wondering just in terms of the long-term direction, obviously you've been spending a lot on new products. At the end of this year, Brazil will be in production. I was wondering kind of what the next big thing is. Have you guys thought of, I don't know, maybe going to China? I guess, what is the next big strategic initiative?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we have a lot of initiatives around the world. Speaking of China, we do sell into China. We've been proud to be selling into China for many, many decades. It's small numbers, but we'd look to grow there. And we're starting to get a foothold in India, which is also very exciting for us. And I think really Brazil is not just sort of a open the door, and then it's over. We're there for 50, 100 years. And so we want to grow that and bring the same sort of great service and great products that we bring to our customers in North America and Europe. And of course, there's always opportunities in growing in the Middle East and Africa, so there's a lot of things going on.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","But not necessarily an appetite to replicate the Brazil approach in some of these other big, developing markets?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I don't think I can really comment on that at this time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So just wanted to follow up on the 11-liter. Out of curiosity, was any of the R&D increase this quarter and this year related to any final work on that and\/or the decision to go to the U.S. in 2015? And just wanted to ask the decision to go later [ph] in Peterbilt and Kenworth, was that product fit-related or just because the market is not as big for the 11-liter here in the U.S.?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. I think the 11-liter -- yes, obviously there has been R&D and capital investment for the 11-liter in terms of the manufacturing side of our business, but also just supporting it and getting our dealers ready for it. The 11-liter is a smaller market size at this time in North America. And I just thought it made more sense to begin in Europe, where really we only have PACCAR engines in our DAF products. And we have the 9.2-liter at DAF. And this is a nice, new product to, let's call it, transition from the 9-liter to the 11-liter. So that's really the reasoning.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. And are you seeing any increase in mid-size fleets in the U.S.? Credit availability, I guess, you can see. Is that continuing to be okay? And are you seeing the mid-size fleets sort of step up? And then if I could just sneak in my last one, have you announced any production timing changeover for Euro 6 when you stop making the Euro 5?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. I think the -- I'd say all fleets, small, medium, large that are operating today are very experienced. They've been through some challenging times over the last decade and they're doing well. I can't say that one is stepping up versus the other. I think they each take a look at their own customers and see how they're doing. Obviously, there's been a lot of discussion recently about housing starts and, of course, housing starts also translates into white goods and carpets. And the car business is strong right now, so there's some benefit for steel and glass and aluminum and electrics, electronics. So if you're a trucking company that works for that industry, you're thinking things are pretty darn good.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And the changeover for the Euro 6, Euro 5?","Mark C. Pigott","It really -- the deadline is January 1, 2014, but the transitions are occurring now. We're selling Euro 6 XF vehicles today out of DAF. And we'll be introducing the CF and the LF as we progress through the middle and the latter part of this year. And so a customer can have a Euro 6 vehicle or they can have a Euro 5 vehicle up to January 1, 2014, if they're driving in the eurozone. But we'll continue to offer Euro 5 vehicles outside of the eurozone.","Robert J. Christensen","Next year, absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Question on your North American outlook. It seems to imply that truck orders rise into the second quarter from the first quarter after running at sort of a 180,000 kind of a rate for the first quarter sales, where they usually kind of take a small seasonal step-down. Can you talk about quoting activity and what you're seeing that would support an improvement in orders from here? And how long does it usually take for the bidding activity that you've been seeing, I think, since January to translate into orders?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. We are certainly thinking, and along with our entire industry, that there should be a pickup in the second half. We're not the only industry that's saying that. As you read the financial press, there are many industries that are talking about it. I think for the general U.S. economy, they're certainly hoping for an improvement in the second half. So certainly, our industry is in line with that. In terms of seasonality, typically, we don't see a lot of seasonality. Yes, there are people who buy different -- for different sectors of trucking, but that tend to be evenly spaced throughout the year. So I don't really see much seasonality on that. We're starting to see some customers are interested in replacing more vehicles, say, coming out of the Mid-America Show, where Kenworth and Peterbilt launched a lot of new products. There was a lot of interest. The dealers were in great shape, having a little bit of improvement in their stocking. So we're seeing people there say, \"Hey, it seems like a good time. I'm getting more of a positive feeling for the general economy. But it's not just booming, but getting a better feeling.\" So that's positive right now. And in terms of the amount of time it takes to -- for the customer to think about an order, to placing an order, it really depends on that customer. I can't really say much more than that.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can you just give us a sense of just historically, if you saw an increase in quoting activity? Is it 60 or 90 days later, where you'd see orders start to pick up?","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, I see what you're saying. Okay. All right. Yes, it's hard to say. But I'd say probably in, let's call it, 30 to 90 days because some customers are ready to move quicker than others, but it's -- there's a range like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. When I'm out talking to truck fleets manufacturers, they're telling me how raw material costs are coming down. And I was just wondering what you're experiencing and if that's a factor in the second half if current trends continue.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. I think you and I talked, maybe a couple of years ago, raw material probably had more of an impact. We're seeing because of lower demand on a global basis, some decline in raw materials. Some of it has picked back up a little bit. Let's say with the car guys, we're seeing steel was way down, and now it's come back a little bit, rubber coming back a little bit. But in general, the global demand has slowed. It's not way down. I mean, you've got major countries, China, India, that still have very strong GDP growth, although it may be lower than it was a few years ago. Typically, with our long-term contracts, which probably cover over 70% of all the product we purchase from suppliers, that tends to be sort of flattened out.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up. I know you -- I saw you took the top end of some of your forecast for this year down slightly, yet in your annual report, you said Financial Services assets should increase at about a 5% to 10% rate this year. Are you holding to that Financial Services asset forecast or might that come down a little bit with your kind of global vehicle forecast?","Mark C. Pigott","The annual report is written the end of last year. So that's now 4 or 5 months behind us, and lots of things have happened. I mean, based on the truck forecast ranges that we've talked about, 210,000 to 240,000 and 210,000 to 235,000 in Europe, I think we'll continue to see growth in the portfolio assets because what -- the collections that we're collecting today are originations in 2008, '09 and '10, when portfolio growth was smaller. So we'll still see some modest growth.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Going back to just the previous question about vehicle age and what you're seeing come back to you, we had a very large year for U.S. sales Class 8 trucks in 2006 ahead of 2007 EPA. What sense or what kind of data are you seeing with the trucks that are coming back to you now for fleet replacement? Is that '06? Or I guess, it would be the '07 model year all the way through the system. Or could this be a real opportunity for increased sales and production for the next 18 months?","Mark C. Pigott","In a normal market, a vehicle that's 5, 6 years old will certainly be into its second owner and have pretty high mileage. You could take a look at anywhere from 500,000 to 1 million miles on those vehicles. But with the recession of, let's call it, '09, '10 and part of '11, the mileage on a lot of these vehicles was substantially decreased. They may have been parked, they just may have had less business. So we're finding that those vehicles actually are in great demand because they have typically lower mileage than you would normally associate with a vehicle 5, 6 years old. And so we do talk about an older vehicle fleet age of 7, 8 years old. But if you have a truck that's 7 years old but only has 500,000 miles, it's in pretty good shape versus one that has 1 million miles. So you kind of have to read between the lines on what these vehicles are actually bringing to the party. Right now, those vehicles on the used market are really doing well.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Right. Well, I guess, I mean, if you were able to define any sort of forecast for your own fleet customers who are potentially selling some of those vehicles on to their second owners right now and getting some pretty substantial markups on the used side, do you think that there's any opportunity for you over the next 18 months or so because of this dynamic? Or has that ship sailed?","Mark C. Pigott","We have a portfolio of trucks that we have on operating lease in our finance operation and in Europe as well. And so we have a constant inflow of used trucks coming back to us. It's not a huge number, several hundred trucks each month in both North America and Europe. And yes, we're able to pass those on based on the market values at the time, which -- we put the values on them at inception based on the strong residual values that the PACCAR products realize in the second-hand market.","Operator","You have another question from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Just a quick follow-up to my earlier question. You were saying that it typically takes 30 to 90 days from the increase in quoting to orders. And I was just checking my notes from the call 3 months ago, and you had said that, I think, it was mid-January that quoting activity had picked up. So 90 days later, are you seeing an increase in order activity at the moment?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the good news is we're increasing our production hopefully 5% to 10%, so we're seeing a little bit.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Robin E. Easton","I'd like to thank everyone for excellent questions, and thank you, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for participating.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded, and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; Bob Christensen, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President and Controller. [Operator Instructions]","Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning.","PACCAR reported good revenues and net income for the fourth quarter. PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and financial services revenues were $4 billion and quarterly net income was $253 million, an after-tax return on revenues of 6.3%. For the full year of 2012, PACCAR reported record revenues of a little over $17 billion. Net annual income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 6% versus 2011. This was the fourth best net income year in our history and PACCAR's 74th consecutive year of earning a net profit. Earnings per share were $3.12, an increase of 9% versus a year ago.","More good news. PACCAR's dividends increased by 22% during the year. I'm very proud of our 21,800 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services worldwide. Our dealers and customers in North America and Europe are benefiting from good freight demand, as evidenced by strong aftermarket parts and service business and excellent PACCAR Financial performance. Customer truck purchases are focused primarily on replacement as they continue to navigate the uncertain global economy.","PACCAR delivered 31,700 trucks during the fourth quarter, an increase of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2012. I'm pleased to report that Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF grew their market share to record levels last year as customers recognized the benefits of our high-quality and efficient trucks. PACCAR's retail share of the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck market was 28.9% and DAF's share of the European above 16-tonne market was 16%. During the year, Kenworth and DAF delivered 6,300 trucks in the Andean region of South America, that's the region outside of Mercosur, and a record 2,700 units in Russia, an increase of 80% compared to 2011.","Looking forward, PACCAR truck deliveries in the first quarter of 2013 are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2012, although they could be lower by 1% to 2%. The fourth quarter North American industry truck orders were encouraging, but there continues to be pressure on truck margins in North America and Europe and we expect first quarter gross margins to be slightly lower compared to fourth quarter. Other good news, though, there is some improvement on vocational truck sales as housing starts are increasing, primarily in the United States.","Looking at the truck market overall in 2013. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales are estimated to be in the range of 210,000 to 240,000 units. In Europe, the greater-than-16-tonne truck market is anticipated to be in the range of 210,000 to 250,000 units. There may be some customers in Europe who will accelerate purchases of the Euro 5 vehicles ahead of the introduction of the Euro 6 emission requirements in 2014.","Reviewing 2012, I'm pleased to say it was a milestone year for PACCAR as we launched more new trucks than at any time in our history, and that's a lot of trucks. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have updated over 60% of their product range with new fuel-efficient, ergonomic and, I like to say, stylish vehicles. We're very pleased with the excellent response from dealers and customers to the new Kenworth T680 and the Peterbilt Model 579. The new DAF XF Euro 6, powered by the PACCAR MX-13 engine, will begin production this spring.","PACCAR's global business initiatives are making excellent progress. New product investments continue in 2013, with many exciting launches planned during the year. Capital spending in 2013 is estimated to be $400 million to $500 million and research and development expenses are estimated to be $225 million to $275 million. Construction of our new DAF assembly factory in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, is on schedule and is expected to begin production in late 2013. PACCAR, as you may know, has approximately 5% share of the total South American truck market, and our medium-term goal is 20%.","PACCAR is investing in its network of 15 parts distribution centers to meet the demands of our customers and dealers. We're constructing a new 280,000-square-foot distribution center in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, which will be opened in April of this year. We're also doubling the capacity of our distribution center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.","Turning to PACCAR Financial. PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $298 million in the fourth quarter compared to $266 million in the prior year. PACCAR Financial's fourth quarter pretax income was $79 million compared to $67 million earned in the fourth quarter of 2011. The excellent results benefited from growth in portfolio balances.","For the full year, PACCAR Financial revenues were $1.1 billion compared to $1 billion a year ago and pretax income was a record $308 million compared to $236 million in the prior year.","PACCAR Financial, with its strong A+ credit rating, has excellent access to the commercial paper and medium-term note markets. Last year, PACCAR Financial issued $2.2 billion in medium-term notes, all at competitive rates.","So in summary, PACCAR continues to enhance its leadership position in the global truck market by investing in new geographic regions and the highest-quality products in the industry.","Thank you, and I'd be pleased to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the 2013 planned R&D reduction, is that just related to an exit from product transition?","Mark C. Pigott","That's a good question, as you know, and obviously you could share my enthusiasm for all the great things that happened last year. A lot of the R&D was focused on probably 2 primary areas. One was the launch of a lot of new trucks by every major division in PACCAR, and also getting ready for Euro 6 and EPA 13 engine emissions. So a lot of that work has either been completely done or is almost done. And so we have other projects but a big chunk was completed last year.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then I wanted to kind of skip to a bigger-picture question on some item -- on an item that you've covered before. But the cycle-to-cycle margin headwinds, you've kind of mentioned we should expect more subdued this cycle relative to last decade, with part of the reason related to this, as you just discussed, the incremental emissions content. And in North America recently, one of your European competitors that competes down in Brazil kind of mentioned the same thing showing up, post Euro 5, down there. And then looking forward, do you expect Europe to be similar to those other regions post Euro 6? And then what sort of actions actually can be taken to kind of offset that and reinvigorate some of the margin performance?","Mark C. Pigott","You bet. Obviously, an area that everybody here spends a lot of time working very diligently. Let's take a look at in sort of 2 segments -- or maybe 3. First of all, Euro 6, the additional cost just to meet the requirements, and I think you've heard this from many people in the industry, will be over EUR 10,000 per vehicle. So there will be additional costs that customers will have to get comfortable with. And we've seen every 3 years or so for the last 20 years, that has some impact on the OEM margins so we just had to work through that. Obviously, we're very diligent about working with programs, whether it's Six Sigma or 5S or other program to try to offset some of that cost impact. On a broader global view, we're working hard as we get into Brazil. And we talked about beginning production late this year. Brazil, so far, has the highest margins of any truck market around the world. And that's certainly benefited our competitors and we look forward to sharing the benefits of that market as we really get up and running and growing our business in Brazil. So I think that's a positive. Another one is, as we bring in our own MX engine and we move things like a common rail, a fuel injection, and we continue to work on reducing the cost of the after-treatment and EGR cooler, I think there's some benefits for margin enhancement on that. And I guess complementing that is the continued growth of our aftermarket business as we get a bigger footprint around the world and continue to be the most focused and most efficient manufacturer in our industry. So I think there are some benefits out there that should enhance margins. But of course, the biggest driver, and I think you and your colleagues have mentioned this many times, is let's get back to a market that's in the top 5 of the last decade and I think you'll see some exciting opportunities. That's really going to be the big driver for margin enhancement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi from Bank of America.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a few questions on Europe. I mean, it looks like, for the industry, you're basically guiding to flat at the midpoint, and the registrations would've finished the year on a pretty weak note. Could you just give us a better sense of what you think the cadence of the year will look like? And if we don't have a prebuy in Europe, is that basically what the low end of the range for Europe of 2010 is implying, i.e., kind of a 5% decline in 2013?","Mark C. Pigott","I think, when you look at Europe and North America, they're probably going to be similar. I think it's been pointed out certainly by competitors and industry analysts. We're really looking for a stronger second half in the North American market and in Europe also, and some of that may be driven by prebuy. We've got a few inklings of some positive economic trends here in the U.S., we'll have to see how that translate into the broader economy. In Europe, if people decide that they want to take a little bit more of a wait-and-see attitude on absorbing the Euro 6 cost increases, that'll have an impact. There may be ongoing challenges in some of the European countries in terms of their just general economies. So I think that's why we have a little broader, broader range there. And of course, as the months go on, we'll all get a little bit smarter and be able to adjust that range accordingly.","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then could you just talk a little bit more about pricing and what you're seeing in the different regions and maybe what we should think about in terms of a price contribution overall for 2013 at this point?","Mark C. Pigott","Are you talking about truck pricing?","Ross P. Gilardi - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Truck pricing, yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. Well, the good news is that many of our dealers, because of their strong focus and work on their absorption, had record years last year or very strong years, and a lot of our good customers are starting to report strong and, some of them, even record results in the fourth quarter, from what you see in the different industry press. So that's encouraging. The people that are still operating, and there's many, many good ones, have survived a couple of tough downturns in the last decade. But they're cautious, some of them have announced that they're going to be increasing their purchases, but I think, in that, it's still primarily replacement because I think everybody's waiting to see what the tone and the direction of the general economy is. And as we move through the year, if the housing gets going, and that's going to be a benefit for steel and concrete and brick and everything, all the white goods that go inside a house, we'll see a lot of our customers perhaps expanding their fleet, and that'll be good for pricing overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, maybe following on, on that last question, if you could talk about order trends that you've seen recently. Obviously, we've seen sort of a -- maybe some of the political headwinds that have been out there in the U.S. have started to subside a little bit, and certainly, the markets, the equity markets, are doing pretty well. And you mentioned some freight guys reporting decent results. Have you seen any subtle change in your customers recently?","Mark C. Pigott","I think, in terms of our -- I mean, we have the same great customers we've been working with for quite a few years. But the positive aspect that we monitor on a daily basis is, say, quotations and inquiries in terms of who is looking for trucks and how many trucks are they looking for. And I think, obviously the first half of last year was pretty strong and then it slowed down in the second half, as you can see by the truck data. In the last, I'd say 2 months, we're actually seeing an uptick in inquiries and quotations. Customers are saying, \"You know, it could be good this year, or certainly better.\" So I think that's somewhat encouraging. That has not translated into a one-per-one order intake. And you've seen a number of our competitors have announced a shutdown or layoffs and different types of programs to reduce their costs. So I think there might be some improvement in the fundamentals just as we look at the number of quotations that our customers are interested in getting current pricing on.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, Mark, that's helpful. If I could shift gears. If you look at your other revenue, you're reporting geography -- your geographical presence. It dropped a little bit sequentially. I assume some of that, maybe a lot that, weakness is Mexico. But maybe if you could talk about that particular market and then any other sort of one-off markets and how they're doing, Australia, Middle East, that kind of stuff.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. Well, Mexico, which we've been there since the late '50s, it's really one of the jewels in the crown for us. And the Mexican market is pretty good. It did slow down a little bit. I think what probably had more of an impact was the country of Colombia, which has been on a very proactive, positive growth program for the general economy over the last few years and have taken a lot of our trucks and have done very, very well. They've completed some of their projects, including a major pipeline, but they're now reviewing other infrastructure investments, which I think will stimulate truck demand again. So that's had a little bit of a slowdown last year. That may take a little bit of time to reenergize. Australia, it continues to perform well and achieved many records last year. And we continue to be a leader with the Kenworth product, and then in the last few years we've also introduced the DAF product. And DAF's done very well in Australia. So that's gone well. So overall, I think, maybe a little bit of a recalibration in, let's call it, Colombia and a few other countries. But I think they're going to get back on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, maybe you guys could talk a little bit about your truck sales which were up -- down 19% year-over-year, but Financial Services revenue is up 12%. Is that a penetration story? And maybe you could just give us some more color?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, we can. Well, the finance group has really done an outstanding job. And our lease organization set many records, which we're very proud of. So I think you've summed it up pretty well that we're financing about 30% of our trucks on a global basis and the customers that we're financing are doing well. I mean, very low past dues and the customers are making good money, as you've seen. So I think it's just -- it's really a credit. I'd look at it as a positive, it's a credit to our finance organization for coming out with the programs and working closely with our dealers and customers to continue to grow that business. And $308 million operating profit, all-time record, is a nice credit to the entire finance organization.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Turning around to first quarter guidance. You said that it will be comparable to Q4, maybe slightly lower. If we add up the days, we would probably have a couple more days in Q1 versus Q4. So are you implying that you're cutting your daily production rates again? Or are we losing days because Easter is early or something like that?","Mark C. Pigott","We've had a few shutdown days, like everybody else. So yes, you're absolutely right on your math in terms of there are a few more days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, with the holidays in the fourth quarter. But I think, just looking at the number of trucks and margins, it's going to be comparable. There's certainly some -- a couple of percent pressure impact that we're looking at.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just finally, as a follow-up. Are you going to be offering the 12-liter Cummins Westport CNG engine? And what -- are you getting any inquiries on the CNG side? Is that where some of the potential pick-up in inquiries is coming from? Or maybe just speak to that whole sector.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. Well, we're very proud, particularly, well, all of our truck divisions, of being a leader on the natural gas industry and been doing this for, well, gosh, over 15 years now. We offer the 9-liter and the 15-liter, but we're certainly -- are well aware of the 12-liter and have worked with Cummins. We continue to be Cummins' largest partner. We're proud of that and proud of what they've done. So I think, in terms of the natural gas, we've got great product. In terms of the inquiry pick-up, I'd say it's more on the vocational side and perhaps more on some of the -- are just online truckload customers. Natural gas will be a factor, but at this time it's a pretty small factor. We'll just have to see over time how the infrastructure shakes out to -- across, well, North America and, certainly, Europe. Well, we offer a full range and we continue to be the leader and we're proud of it.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Mark, was that a no on the 12-liter?","Mark C. Pigott","We have 12 liters running in our fleets and we continue to look at a wide range of offerings. Of course, we're very excited about an engine called the MX-13.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Hence the reason I was asking. But okay, I'll talk to Rob and ask about that [ph].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if we could talk about the R&D budget for 2013. And can you just frame for us the reduction? Was it an opportunity to combine some engineering across a couple of platforms? Or are there any projects that you're pushing out? Just give us some context, if you don't mind, on the better productivity or otherwise.","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, absolutely. Well, I think, as we might have mentioned earlier, we've completed a lot of major, exciting projects and launched a lot of new products. R&D, I think the change is really minimal because we'll continue to work on new projects and products every year. And I think as 2013 progresses, I know a lot of our engineers have got new things they want to share with the industry, so that'll be a lot of fun and good for our customers and our dealers. And I think that's the very straightforward story.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you could just flesh out for us the production outlook for the first quarter versus the fourth, if you don't mind. We heard from one of your competitors reducing build rates in Europe, and I'm just wondering, how does your Europe-versus-U.S. production mix look like relative to the production guidance that you gave.","Mark C. Pigott","I think, in line with my comments and a little bit of what we talked about in the press release, that the production both in Europe and North America will be comparable, though it could be a couple percent down compared to the fourth quarter. And customers are liking our products. And we continue to look at new products and maintain the strong growth and the share that the teams have been able to achieve over the last number of years. So I'd say comparable, though there's -- there could be 1% to 2% down.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, you have a meaningful new product launch in Europe. I'm wondering if you could just comment on the margin structure of the new product compared to the one it replaces. Are there any material cost reductions or otherwise? And then what are the implications of the product rollout on your production schedule in 2013 versus what might be a more typical seasonality at your facilities?","Mark C. Pigott","Right. That's the new DAF XF Euro 6 which we launched at the Hannover Show in September. People are very excited about it. I think, in terms of pricing to the customer, it's going to be comparable. We're obviously excited about some of the aerodynamics and benefits that the vehicle will bring to our customers. And that'll -- so it starts coming out April, May time and I think there's just a gradual buildup over the rest of the year. And hopefully there'll be some small benefit on the margin side, but we'll just have to see how the general economy plays out across Europe because that is the large macro impact that all of us have to work through. But it's a very exciting, great-looking truck and -- boy, it just got a lot of positive press, our customers and dealers are really looking forward to production.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mark, a couple of things, follow-up. First, you've made some sort of encouraging comments about the vocational market. If that were to flow through, is that margin-enhancing for you, an increase in the mix of vocational?","Mark C. Pigott","I think, slightly, yes, yes. We're -- obviously, we work with a number of the major bodybuilders and they are slightly encouraged by what they're seeing. And there's -- but yes, it's good business. Also, over time, it's -- over time, it's good business for dealers, parts and service because these vehicles are in some rugged applications.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Super. I then wanted to ask a couple of things on the MX engine that you mentioned a couple of times. What's the mix right now in kind of your most recent few months of orders of MX engine for you guys?","Mark C. Pigott","It continues to be in the 25% to 30% range. And yes, we've -- so we just passed the -- I think we're up to about 35,000 out running, and that's going well. We've got a lot of very positive stories from our customers about excellent fuel economy, reliability, low noise, easy to drive. So we're very encouraged. We got -- have you been down to our Mississippi factory yet?","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, I'm afraid I'm maybe the only one who hasn't. But I would tour it...","Mark C. Pigott","All right, we'll get you down there. You'd enjoy it.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Can I just ask, I'm assuming that all of these engines are now coming from Mississippi and that you're no longer importing anything meaningful from Europe on this MX engine. Is that correct?","Mark C. Pigott","That's essentially true, yes.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that should actually be helpful to margins in '13 versus '12, I'm guessing.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I mean, a little bit. We're actually making a few things now in Mississippi that we're sending to Europe. So the factory is fully engaged and completely outfitted with wonderful robotics and new machinery. We have a great work force there. So I think, over the next couple of years, you're going to see a lot of really wonderful things coming out of Mississippi.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. First, Mark, just on the margins, if we look at margins as we end 2013, let's talk about operating margins relative to 2012. You'll have lower R&D. Europe, potentially more profitable products. Vocational, potentially more profitable products. You talked about shipping more engines from Mississippi and stuff like that. I mean, overall, given the forecast that you've given, do you think your margins in 2013, your operating margins, can be -- do you expect them to be up versus 2012? And then my next question is, can you just talk about, as we ended 2012, sale -- trucks going into sort of the energy markets, how much they were down and what your expectation is or what you're seeing in terms of order trends more currently for trucks going into the energy markets?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure, sure. I think, on margins, I think it's going to be, as I've mentioned at the beginning, for 2013, will be...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","For the full year, as we end the year, not for the first quarter.","Mark C. Pigott","Right. I think it'll be comparable to 2012. We really need -- and you've been very excellent and diligent about asking these questions for many years and we try to give you good answers. The overall market is still down and we've got to get the general economy going again. I mean, it's not just us as representatives of the commercial vehicle market, there's lots of different industries that want to get this market going again. And I think, as that happens, with the improvements and the investments we've made in our factories and our processes, we'll see some margin enhancements. So if we can get back to a solid 2%, 3% GDP growth, and customers are feeling good about growing their fleets, which is important. I think we started out the comments by saying it's going to be primarily a replacement market, then you'll see some enhancement because our factories are ready, they're the most efficient in our history. These trucks are the best we've ever built in our history. And that's -- so we're ready.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No, I mean, I -- no, I get that. But to some degree, you could say you have an R&D tailwind, which we didn't have before. Do you know what I mean, so, you have a more profitable mix? Like, I'm just surprised it's not better than what you're -- I mean, is pricing the biggest factor when you're thinking about things, I mean, besides the market?","Mark C. Pigott","Absolutely. We still have plenty of competitors that, let's say, have a slightly different view on pricing than we do, and that's the world we live in.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then -- sorry, on the energy side, what you're seeing there.","Mark C. Pigott","Oh, the energy. It's -- we sell to the major energy producers, they're great customers. I think that side has slowed down a little bit, there was strong orders last year, that we still continue to get orders. But I think it's now shifting back more towards the, let's call it, traditional on-highway customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein from Citigroup.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just following up on the mix, but it was actually trying to get at the truck-versus-parts mix. And you had mentioned a lot of the work you've done in terms of expanding your distribution centers. I'm curious what -- or when -- the benefit of having these 30,000 MX engines in North America in operation, when do you start seeing a -- when do you get enough mileage accumulated, where that starts to become additive to your parts contribution.","Mark C. Pigott","Absolutely. Well, we've got a great history, of course, with the MX engine in Europe. And it's going to be a couple of years. And of course, the good news is we want these engines to be fantastic, and they are. And so to have parts business is some benefit, but we're really working hard to not have too much. But it's a couple of years.","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just so I understand it, Mark, what leads to the Class -- in changing in terms of how you -- the capitalization versus expensing of the new product tooling, what -- why does that occur, I guess? I'm trying to understand why it was...","Mark C. Pigott","Okay, are you talking about the little footnote we had?","Timothy Thein - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes.","Mark C. Pigott","Okay.","Unknown Executive","Yes, just we identified certain production tooling investments that were long-lived assets and therefore were capitalized.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that's pretty straightforward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, as we think about a Euro 6 equipped truck, it's EUR 10,000 more expensive. When you look at the operating costs for the customer, does it go up? And what happens to the fuel economy?","Mark C. Pigott","Actually, the fuel economy, with the additional after-treatment, is able to stay at the same level as Euro 5, which is a big plus. There's a lot of additional equipment and we've been able to maintain our weight positions. So the truck is -- one, it's receiving a lot of attention from customers with the attractive operating characteristics, as it will be launched in spring.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And if I could just follow up on the R&D questions. It makes sense that the R&D would be coming down post some of these product launches that you had in 2012. Would you expect the R&D to pick back up going forward in 2014 and beyond as we get into kind of a more volume business in South America and, hopefully, volume in North America and Europe comes back?","Mark C. Pigott","I think R&D will be in the range that you've seen over the last couple of years. It may not have the peak for a number of years because we've updated and replaced over 60% of our trucks, so that's the majority of the trucks. The big-engine emission requirements are done, although now we're working with greenhouse gas which is -- really goes from 2014 to 2017, in that time frame. So I think it's going to be in the range. The factories that we're building will be complete in Brazil this year. But there's always opportunities and new great ideas that come up from our teams. But I think it's in the range. It may be a little bit lower for a couple of years. But if we come up with a great new idea, we're going to fund it and put people on it and work hard on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about Brazil. So you're talking about production starting, I guess, in the fourth quarter. Should we expect an expense ramp ahead of that as you add staffing and tooling and things? I mean, is that something that we need to factor into the margins for the second half of the year? And I guess the follow-up is, when do you think you would be at kind of a critical mass of production there?","Unknown Executive","Yes, so as the Brazil plant continues to develop during the course of the year, we would expect to see a little bit of investments there that will affect our results, but it'll be gradual as we go throughout the year.","Mark C. Pigott","That's on the expense side. And then in terms of ramping up, well, certainly, we hope that our customers or potential new customers get excited about the product. We've had a lot of early indications, and we're putting our dealer network into position throughout the country of Brazil. But it will take a couple of years to ramp it up because we build to order, as you know, but early indications are people are looking forward to the product, the product is performing well. And a lot of the customers are aware of DAF. They either have connections with European operators or they've seen the DAF operate in different countries in South America. So they've also seen how it competes very well against the current suppliers in Brazil and they know that DAF is now #2 in Europe. And that gives them great comfort that DAF will offer a very robust, high-quality product for the Brazilian and Argentinian market.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I -- and if I could ask a follow-up. If your -- I mean, it seems like your CapEx and your R&D is getting -- is peaking here or has peaked, so maybe heading back the other way, does that change your thoughts on capital allocation at all with share repurchase or increasing the dividend?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the -- that's a great question. Of course, one of the wonderful opportunities of working for PACCAR is we have a very strong balance sheet, a very conservative, focused company so that we're able to do, within reason, a lot of these different activities. Have a good CapEx program and repurchase shares and continue to invest in the overall business. So as CapEx comes down a little bit, I think it's important to recognize we have still many, many projects going on. We have all these wonderful ideas being generated everyday by our teams throughout PACCAR, that we'll continue to fund these great ideas and we want to make sure that we have a very attractive program for our shareholders. And you've seen over, well, decades, a very good quarterly dividend program, occasionally a special dividend, if that's what's merited, and a share repurchase. So we try to work on all fronts with equal facility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of J. B. Groh from D.A. Davidson.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Did you -- I might've missed this, did you give the truck and aftermarket parts sales numbers?","Mark C. Pigott","We will to you, J.B.","Unknown Executive","Yes, the -- for 2012, it was -- the parts sales were 2,667,000,000 compared to 2,577,000,000 in 2011.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. All right, so I can back out from there?","Mark C. Pigott","You bet.","Unknown Executive","Yes.","J. B. Groh - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I -- great picture of the new Eindhoven facility. Do we -- when would we -- would we expect to see any sort of inventory impacts from opening that in early part of the second quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","I'm -- no. But I'm glad you raised that because I think a few people talked about general inventory, and I think you all noted that inventory has come down. And I would anticipate inventory would come down a little bit more particularly as the few remaining 2010 -- EPA 2010 engines are installed in customer vehicles. So we pride ourselves on excellent inventory turns and low inventory. I think you'll see some improvement in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Potter from Piper Jaffray.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to come back to the natural gas theme here. I know that you guys have historically, I guess I'd characterize it as, hedged your comments there. You're acknowledging that it's a theme. You're prepared for it. You have the product...","Mark C. Pigott","And we're the market share leader, no hedging there. We're full in.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Exactly. All of that -- right. But you have stopped short of saying that this is kind of a fundamental change. When you talked about it just here a couple of minutes ago, you were talking about mostly on vocational, not yet on long-haul trucking. You have people talking about this year or at some point, presumably, this being kind of a transformational thing, but it sounds like, maybe this year, you don't see that coming. Would you say that that's accurate?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, there are certainly numerous conferences, and maybe you've attended some of them or read about them in industry press. We're excited about the opportunities in natural gas. We have the products. We've got the experience. Our dealers are ready. We certainly have some long-standing customers, particularly a number of them in the port areas. If the infrastructure and a major company, whether it's in the resource industry or somebody else, makes a investment to allow online, highway, natural gas trucks, we're ready for that. That's all we can do. We're ready. We're the leader. So we're excited about it. But until that happens, we'll continue to sell to people that have other requirements in the industry, which is diesel. It's a wonderful fuel and it's very productive.","Alexander E. Potter - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, I guess, my last question here, on G&A. If you could just comment on, I guess, kind of what tools you have in your toolbox for trying to maintain G&A, maintain flexibility in the face of kind of this production uncertainty. I know that last quarter people spent a lot of time talking about production cuts across the industry, to try to realign themselves with this kind of new normal. Would you say that that's -- that theme has basically played out? Or are we just going to kind of see this continue to bleed out over the next couple of quarters?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, G&A and SE&A and managing our general budgets has been one of -- I'm glad you brought it up because that has one of PACCAR's strengths and is -- for 107 years. We run a very efficient, tight ship. And I think we typically lead the industry in the up cycle and the down cycle and the status quo cycle. So that's one of our great strengths. And if the industry is sort of similar to last year, we work it, we continue to see how we're going to become more efficient. And I think, as we've shared over the last, oh, gosh, couple of decades, we're trying to get 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7% productivity improvement in our factories every single year. In fact, we now have a program where we go out and we'll work with our suppliers and our dealers and teach them how to manage efficiently whether it's through Six Sigma or 5S. And it's a nice little business that we've been able to generate. So that's one of the core strengths of PACCAR.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Trahan.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","This is a quick follow-up. I didn't really understand your answer on the tooling footnotes, on capitalization. Was that related to Mississippi or just some new products? Or is that just sort of the normal course of business?","Unknown Executive","It is new product tooling.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And so that would be sort of an ongoing change, not a onetime thing, right?","Unknown Executive","Yes. It was normal change related to new product tooling in Europe.","Mark C. Pigott","It's really focused in Europe.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And I guess, as just one other sort of housekeeping: can you give the margins between the truck and aftermarket segments?","Unknown Executive","We'll have that broken out in our annual report when we report it as a segment.","Mark C. Pigott","I think we mentioned in the press release that, with the growth of our parts business, we look forward to having that as a separate segment and so we'll have that broken out.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And I'm not sure if you'll be able to answer this one at this point. But going into 2013, obviously, production is going to be down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis, but we are expecting an improvement through the year in both North America and Europe. Overall, do you -- can you give us any sense of what you're expecting for sales for 2013? Are you expecting up, down or flat?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. I think on -- first of all, on the production side, I think we're looking at that as -- in Europe, it could be comparable. In North America, there's some improvement, should be comparable. So I think that's more of the takeaway, I think, you want to be looking at. It's sort of comparable to last year. I mean, there may be some ups and downs, depending on the economy. That's the main one. On sales -- and sales really follows production, so sort of comparable.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Would -- should there be some -- a little bit of a headwind given what you talked about in Colombia and some of the Andean markets? Was that sort of overbuilding a little bit relative to normal this year?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no, no. That was -- we build to order. And all those trucks, if you go down to Colombia, you'll see a lot of good-looking Kenworths driving around. And so they're in operation, they're being reassigned to different types of haulage. But we're looking for that to pick up. It may not happen this year in Colombia. I mean, it's just one market. But as they say, if we get the housing market improving, which it's gone from a low of something over 400,000 starts and now there's projections of 700,000, 800,000, 900,000, that's going to have a positive impact on many, many industries. And certainly, trucking will be one of them.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And there's a lot of truckloads in a house.","Mark C. Pigott","There seem to be. We like it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So I had a question on the sequential change in gross margin. It went from sort of, I don't know, 12 4 to, I guess, 11 9 if you back out the accounting change. Is there any production disruption or issue there? Or should I assume it was maybe pricing related?","Mark C. Pigott","I think pricing related is a very astute judgment.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Perfect. That's helpful. And then second question would be: you mentioned the ramp-up in Brazil, are you going to be shipping product? Or are you already shipping product from one of the Western plants to Brazil in order to prep the dealers, in order to stock the inventory and to get sales rolling? And will that have an effect on margin? I don't know, you said a couple of quarters ago you had not done that. I don't know if you've started yet.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we are -- we certainly have test vehicles running in Brazil, very normal as you go into a new market. And we also have a lot of experience in other countries of South America. So there will be some trucks placed in-country so that the dealers have product to sell. But we're really -- we're building that factory because we're going to supply South America from our Brazil factory. So it's -- that's our focus right now.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","No, for sure, I understand that. I was -- the underlying question is just whether you saw a gross margin hit because you had to pay a tariff on stuff that you were stocking the dealers with until the factory is up.","Mark C. Pigott","That's -- no. No, no impact at all. Good question, though. And of course, we want to invite everybody down to Brazil probably early next year. We can show you our beautiful facility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I'd -- unfortunately, I'm late in the call here so a lot of my questions have been asked, but let me ask you a fluffy one here. We talk about the new product. You talk about how we're pushing MX and you've got the new XF Euro 6 engine with DAF. What are customers asking you for today that you don't do?","Mark C. Pigott","That is a great question. We should get you on our strategic planning group. It's funny, -- our -- I've been in this business 35 years and I've had -- I got a lot of wonderful friends, customers and dealers. And the list is probably long of things that they would like us to do. The good news is that we are ahead of their request the vast majority of the time and they're very, very happy. But there's always, whether it's minor design enhancements, different services. But I'd say, the vast majority of the time, we're ahead of what they're expecting. But occasionally, there are some really good ideas that we do incorporate. And we have customer panels, groups of people get together. We have dealer groups that get together. We have supplier groups that get together. And it -- I -- this is going to -- you asked me a nice, fluffy one, I'll give you a little bit of a fluffy answer. But we pride ourselves on the highest-quality products with the best residual and the lowest operating costs. And that's what we deliver. So when you're getting that as a customer, you're generally pretty happy.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So outside of, say, natural gas which, as you say, we're poised and we're ready but it's not ready. There's nothing meaningful the industry is asking for that isn't in the product lineup right now?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no. That's -- no. That's -- I mean, it's a good question, though. We have a very broad array of product offerings and options that we bring to the market on a global basis. And in the markets where we are, I think we have a -- we do a very, very good job. As we move into China and India -- they have slightly different demands and that's what we're working through to get a better understanding of what that market requires. And that's a ways off. But certainly, now with our growth in India, we have a couple hundred of wonderful employees working there, whereas a couple of years ago we did not. That is certainly opening our eyes to another opportunity. And we're sort of bringing that on board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Sponheimer from Gabelli & Company.","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Just a question on December and concerns heading into the fiscal cliff around bonus depreciation. What sense, particularly in the used market, did you get from your dealers that there may have been some sort of, I don't know, I don't even want to call it a prebuy, but concerns that there might have been the loss of the bonus depreciation and maybe some purchases pulled forward from the first quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","Let's talk a little bit about used trucks because that is an important element, certainly, in our life and the life of our customers and our dealers. As we look over the last 4 years, going back to the early part -- or the late part of '09, the good news is that used trucks are up about 65% in value over the last 4 years. And that's very, very encouraging in terms of our average sales price. Towards the end of last year, there was a little bit of a falloff, but now we've seen -- starting out this year, we've seen a pretty steady -- in terms of used truck valuations. So that's one of the real core strengths that we bring to our customers with Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF, is that our vehicles 3, 4, 5 years out are going to be worth significantly more than our competitors', and we said that time and time again in the used truck marketplace...","Brian Sponheimer - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","Are you comfortable with the amount of inventory, used inventory, in the system right now on an industry-wide basis, as far as holding up most of it [ph] for your trucks?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, yes. No, we're comfortable with it. And I mean, just general inventory for our dealers is actually pretty low. And I think our dealers are adding -- I'm talking about new trucks now, but adding new trucks to customers as they see a little bit of a pickup. But used truck inventory is -- yes, it's reasonable, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Satish Athavale from KSA Capital.","Satish Athavale","So Mark, looking at your aftermarket spare parts business. That business was growing at double-digit pace last year. And throughout 2012, it looks to have decelerated pretty rapidly. And in the second half, it looks like it was actually down year-over-year. So you commented that your customers seem to be doing fine, so why is there this seeming disconnect between your aftermarket spare parts business and...","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the good news, aftermarket was at record levels, so that's -- let's sort of lay the foundation there, that's important. In fact, it's the third consecutive year of record sales for parts. So the -- I think the parts team have done an outstanding job. In terms of any slowdown in the parts sales, and remember this is a slowdown to a record, very important. I think that's -- primarily be in Europe as some of the southern countries, which are well documented, with challenges, we've seen some definite slowdowns there. But on the other hand, we're going to be opening a brand-new distribution center. I know a number of the tech companies get a lot of press when they open up distribution centers. I hope we do also. And we've already had probably close to 1,000 of our parts and service people from the dealers in Europe going through our new center. And I think there'll be some renewed enthusiasm for the aftermarket business in Europe.","Satish Athavale","Okay, great. So for next year, to -- I mean, for this year, 2013, what kind of growth should we expect from the aftermarket business?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we don't typically break out that. But the team is working hard to do another great job.","Satish Athavale","I'm sure they will. So one last question: what was your effective tax rate, excluding the one-off item, in the fourth quarter?","Unknown Executive","Be around 32%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Van Skiver [ph] from Hedge Cue [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Could you provide your backlog at year end? And secondly, could you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of market share next year given what you see in the present order trends?","Mark C. Pigott","Those are 2 great questions which we typically don't really share too much. Backlog is probably coming down a little bit.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Mr. Robin Easton, PACCAR's Treasurer. Mr. Easton, please go ahead.","Robin E. Easton","Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Robin Easton, Treasurer of PACCAR. And joining me this morning are Mark Pigott, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Ron Armstrong, President; and Michael Barkley, Vice President, Controller.","As with prior conference calls, if there are members of the media participating, we request that they participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results.","I would now like to introduce Mark Pigott.","Mark C. Pigott","Good morning. PACCAR reported record quarterly revenues and strong net income for the fourth quarter of 2011. PACCAR's fourth quarter sales and Financial Services revenue were $4.85 billion compared to $3 billion in the fourth quarter a year ago, a 58% increase. Quarterly net income increased to $328 million, a 92% increase versus the $170 million earned a year ago. I am pleased to report that this was the best quarterly profit since the first quarter of 2007, 5 years ago.","Earnings per share were $0.91 in the fourth quarter, nearly double the $0.46 earned in the fourth quarter of 2010. PACCAR's 2011 yearly net income of $1.04 billion was the fourth highest profit in company history and marked the company's 73rd consecutive year of earning a net profit. Quite a record. I'm very proud of our 23,400 employees who have delivered industry-leading products and services to our customers worldwide.","Increased truck deliveries, higher aftermarket sales and growing Financial Services business worldwide contributed to PACCAR's increased profits. Our customers in North America are benefiting from increased freight tonnage and higher freight rates, which is generating good profitability for their business and enabling them to replace their aging fleets.","In the U.S. and Canada, Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved a record Class 8 market share of 28.1%. Kenworth Mexicana achieved a record Class 8 market share of 45% in Mexico. Europe's 2011 industry registrations were up 33% compared to 2010, and DAF achieved a record 15.5% share in the above 15-tonne market.","You all read the newspapers or do it electronically, and you can see that economic uncertainties in recent months in the Eurozone have resulted in lower industry truck orders. As result, DAF has reduced build rates by a total of 20%, similar to many, in fact most of its competitors, since last November.  The good news is that freight tonne miles in Germany, which is the largest market in Europe, is the highest in 5 years, which we hope will translate into increased truck orders as the year progresses.","PACCAR delivered 41,000 trucks during the fourth quarter, 69% more than the same period last year. Market pricing has improved, and coupled with increased plant utilization has generated higher quarterly truck gross margins of 9.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 6.7% a year ago. PACCAR does expect to deliver slightly fewer trucks in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the lower production rates at DAF.","U.S. and Canadian industry retail truck sales were 197,000 units last year, in line with our estimates, and we are estimating that they will improve to a range of 210,000 to 240,000 units this year, assuming ongoing replacement of the aging truck fleet and some economic growth. In Europe, the greater than 15-tonne market was 244,000 units in 2011, and it's anticipated the European industry truck sales this year will be in the range of 210,000 to 240,000 units. While we welcome improved markets in the U.S. and Canada, it's still a far cry from the 360,000 units which were the record about 5 years ago.","The company generated over $1.5 billion in cash from operations in 2011. And we're very proud to say that we returned over $800 million to stockholders in dividends and share repurchases. Capital additions totaled $538 million. PACCAR plans to continue to make significant investments in its business this year. Capital spending is estimated to be $450 million to $550 million, and research and development will be in the $275 million to $325 million range.","More good news, PACCAR's SG&A percent of 2.6% was a quarterly record, reflecting excellent productivity and cost controls throughout the company and I thank all our wonderful employees for their hard work.","PACCAR is increasing its investments to expand its geographical footprint and build on its technology and productivity leadership. I think many of you saw the press release of the groundbreaking for the construction of the new DAF assembly facility in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, and we have begun construction of the factory and look forward to building trucks in Brazil in the middle of 2013.","PACCAR did deliver a record number of Kenworth and DAF trucks in 2011 in the Andean region of South America, where we've been present for 40 to 50 years. ","Switching continents, following the establishment of the PACCAR Technical Center in Pune, India, DAF participated in the Delhi Auto Expo, India's largest commercial vehicle show. That was about 3 weeks ago. And many of you have visited the European and North American truck shows. I would just tell you that if you go to the show in Delhi, over 1.8 million visitors attend that show over a 2-week period. In fact, they limit attendance to 100,000 per day.","China continues to be the largest truck market in the world. However, industry heavy truck sales in China last year were down about 13% due to lower government incentives. PACCAR did expand its Shanghai purchasing office last year and increased the level of component purchases from Chinese suppliers.","Finally, PACCAR established a new sales office in Moscow, Russia last year and in December, we opened a new parts distribution center in Moscow. These actions are facilitating DAF's continued growth in the expanding Russian and CIS truck market as well as Eastern Europe.","PACCAR Financial Services revenues were $266 million in the fourth quarter compared to $244 million a year ago. PACCAR Financials' fourth quarter pretax income improved to $67 million compared to $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. This was the highest quarterly pretax income since the fourth quarter of 2007, and was achieved due to better finance margins and portfolio growth. Past dues were at a low level of 1.5%.","So in conclusion, I'm pleased to say that PACCAR is well positioned to deliver the highest-quality products and services to our customers as we grow in traditional and new markets.","Thank you and I look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question in terms of how we should be thinking about operating leverage at PACCAR going forward. Just looking at this quarter, I would've expected that we got more bang for the buck, given the improvement in Denton in Chillicothe, but operating leverage was similar to the third quarter. So is that the new run rate for operating leverage at PACCAR, or there are some period costs that are going to go away going to next year?","Mark C. Pigott","I think the leverage is very good at our facilities. Obviously, there were -- we pride ourselves being the most productive manufacturer in our industry. And so I say going forward, or I don't know what you mean by that, but maybe this year, probably be in the same range.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Well, but my only question is that historically, coming out of the bottom of the cycle, even adjusting, and I understand that there was a mix adjustment there was a lot of stuff going on, operating leverage at PACCAR was sort of at high teens, low 20s, and this is not to say that the results you have are bad...","Mark C. Pigott","No, they're excellent, as a matter of fact.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's what I thought you were going to say. And having said that, in the past you sort of -- there was more oomph, so to say, coming out of the cycle and this time around is just -- you have said there, earnings pickup.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, well I'm not sure that the industry is coming out of the cycle as has been talked about. We're essentially at a market now of 200,000 units and if you go back 5 or 6 years, you'll see market's 250,000, 280,000 300,000, 340,000, 360,000. Those are not quite double, but 50%, 60%, 70% higher. And those are -- so it continues to be a great market. We enjoy it, but it's surely not to the heyday that it was 5, 6, 7 years ago.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a short question, are there any period costs associated with the start-up of the Brazilian plant at this point?","Mark C. Pigott","Not significant, no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays Capital.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, your guidance for truck sales in U.S. and Canada is right smack in the middle. It's at replacement demand. But when you talk to your customers, is there any evidence that they are going to start expanding their fleets? What I'm trying to figure out is if there's really any upside here, given that the last few months have been a little stronger than some people would've expected in the U.S.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, good question. Well we were just with a large group, sort of a cross-industry mix, if you will, last week and I'll just share a few thoughts. First of all, the customers that are operating today have survived a number of severe recessions over the last 10, 12 years. So they're very good operators. They know their business, they're flexible, they're adaptable. So our customers now are making good profitability. A number of them that are involved in the oil and gas boom are doing very well. And what's interesting, we find a number of customers that typically have not been in that business are, I'd say, gravitating to that or is at least allocating a portion of their resources to explore being in that business. You're now seeing a little bit of improvement in home remodeling, which has been pretty dormant for the last few years. And you can track that through some of the big-box retailers that focus on home remodeling. That can be good for the Trucking business. The technology side, the engine side, we got EPA 13 coming up in about 11 months. We expect that the engines that we will provide, because of things like common rail, will generate a improved fuel economy of a couple percent. I think that will get people interested in upgrading their fleets. And then finally, the age of the part is still 6, 7, 8 years old. And depending on which statistic you look at, but it's certainly one of the oldest in the last 20, 30 years. So customers are doing well, some are doing very well. Certain segments that have been quiet in terms of hauling are starting to improve. Products are coming out of the marketplace that will generate better fuel economy and whether it's more aerodynamics or better engines. And you still got old fleet. So I think the customers are feeling better than they did a few years ago.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mark, that's good color. And then, maybe just a follow-up on Andrew's question. Around -- and really the mix over the next year or in 2012 between the U.S. and Europe, Europe is obviously coming down a little bit and the U.S. is improving. When we look at the margins of those 2 regions, how does that affect 2012 margins in general? Europe may be a little higher margin, or am I mistaken in that?","Mark C. Pigott","Well typically, I think when you look at our industry, as markets go down, I'm talking about the -- less trucks are ordered, margins go down because OEMs are scrambling for the business. So as you look at Europe and you see the press as much as we do -- Europe is a complicated, multi-country coalition. You hear in the press today that unemployment is -- just hit a 10.4%, which is the highest in a number of years whereas in Germany, unemployment is the lowest in over 10 years. So there's a whole lot of things going on. But I think as the market is lower in Europe, that's going to have probably the effect of having some lower margins. As market in the U.S. and Canada improves, maybe margins will slightly improve. But I think overall, it will be about the same as we saw last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan from JPMorgan.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to step back, talk about your own particular integrated engine. You're still settling 79%, 76% of your trucks are going out with Cummins Engine. Can you just talk a little bit about how the introduction of your own engines is going? Have there been any warranty issues? And then some perspective on where we might be by this time next year.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we were selling about 25%, sometimes 30% depending on the month of our own engine. That's in North America. Of course in Europe, it's a much higher percent of our own engines there. It's going well. We're now a little past a year in production, and we're having customers that are ordering their second tranche of engines because of the good fuel economy and reliability and quietness. I think it's been a good start-up, and we continue to invest in the factory and putting in more machining capability. And I think it'll be great to have you come down later in this year, maybe in the fall to sort of see the progress that's being made. I'll be down there in 2 days, and I think it's been very, very good. So all in all, excellent strategic move for PACCAR and Cummins continues to be an excellent partner with us around the world.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just in Europe, I mean in the U.S., I appreciate that PACCAR -- both Kenworth and Peterbilt are pretty strong in the oil and gas sectors. In Europe, the short gains by DAF, is that more because the geographies that DAF is leveraged to are stronger, or are there specific segments where DAF is particularly valued?","Mark C. Pigott","That is one of the best questions you've asked, Ann.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Finally. After 10 years.","Mark C. Pigott","DAF is the tractor leader in Europe. So that is the on-highway segment. And it's been a wonderful 15 years since we acquired DAF and I mean, they're just part of the family. So really what happened, as we grew the company and we've got wonderful dealers, DAF dealers throughout the continent, the initial focus was to sell tractors on-highway. Those are the people that you would see more typically. And so they've grown that very strongly and have 19% share of the tractor market throughout all of Europe. And now that's -- so that's been really the driver for the overall share growth. Now, of course we've always had great product, but we're focusing additionally on the vocational segment. Now some of the vocational segment is good, some of it's a little bit slower, but that's a big focus, particularly on our -- what we call our CF models. And so I see some real exciting opportunities as the years progress because we'll have a very strong base on the tractor side and continue to strengthen our vocational side. And then we also have, call it the urban vehicle, the LF, which is growing. And we're market share leaders, particularly in the U.K. and a few other countries. But that's got a lot of runway ahead of it. So I think DAF's done a great job. We're just picking the segments, designing the product, giving the support, getting leadership and then building on that into the next segment. Excellent question.","Ann P. Duignan - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I presume you'll offer the complete DAF range in Brazil.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, we do. And we're hoping to invite everybody there and give us about a year or so to get everything going, but we'll have the complete range for the LF, the CF and the XF.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Mark, can you talk about your business in Europe? You picked up market share over the course of 2011, and I'm wondering if you can touch on whether you expect a tailwind to your sales numbers versus the overall industry because you're exiting the year at a higher market share rate. And I'm wondering if you could share with us how many dealer locations your partners have added over the past 12 months in the region.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we have -- DAF has about 1,000 dealer locations throughout all of Europe, which is working very, very well. And I think you kind of touched on an interesting point, and that is one of the real strengths of our brand is the strength of the independent dealer network. 99% of our dealer are independent, and I think that has been an area that probably doesn't get enough press and that is these dealers are really focused on working in their home territories. They live there, they work there, their families work there and I think that's been somewhat of a contributor to the growth of DAF over the years. In terms of the tailwind coming from 2011, we don't really forecast market share. We continue to grow and produce the best products, and that has generated increased share as our customers benefit from our products and services. So we look to steady, steady growth. But some years are better than others, but we've been very fortunate and have grown pretty steadily over the last 15 years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And Mark, can you comment how far out your backlog extends in the European business at this point versus where it was maybe a quarter ago?","Mark C. Pigott","Versus a quarter ago? Well, I think it's comparable. Obviously, we've had to adjust the build rates to maintain, let's call it, the weeks of visibility for the production side. And that's kind of how we manage it.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on your Parts business, obviously, we're hitting a transition point for the overall market. Can you talk about what kind of order rates and demand you're seeing in Europe on the parts side? Is it similar to what we're seeing on the new truck demand?","Mark C. Pigott","The Parts business is very steady, if that's what you're kind of asking. Parts, once again, all of the European truck parts, the overall market is not as old as the U.S. and Canada. It is aging somewhat, and we have many new innovative programs whether it's all-makes branding, just more technology involved to make it easier to order parts. We continue to expand our production capability within our parts distribution centers. So Parts business is pretty steady, and good freight's still going on. As I mentioned, the mouth statistics in Germany, so customers -- as we say, if you don't read the paper or you don't read your electronic mail, business is pretty good for many of our customers. Yes, there's -- some Southern Europe is more challenging, but a lot of our customers are doing well. They're just cautious about ordering right now because there are some macroeconomic and political issues that frankly I don't think any of us know how that's going to get resolved. So the customers that are driving and hauling freight every day are saying, \"Love the product, would like to order more. I'm going to order some.\" Just because something unusual happens. I want to be in good shape as their own independent company. So Parts are good business.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, can we talk about the margin structure for '12 versus '11, and the level of operating leverage we should be looking for? Obviously, you're going to get some nice productivity gains out of your freshly added U.S. workforce but on the flip side, with lower production rates in Europe. Do you still expect to deliver similar level of gross margin leverage that you did this year or in '11?","Mark C. Pigott","I think you summed it up very accurately. There's some slight upside potential in North America, but that's countered or muted by what's going on in Europe. So I think it's going to be comparable, maybe a little bit down this year compared to last year. Just -- we will have to see how Europe shakes out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Henry Kirn from UBS.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the mix in revenues, the fourth quarter revenues were a lot stronger than we expected. Was there anything in the geographic or product mix that influenced the quarter? Or did pricing step up more severely than maybe I expected in the quarter?","Mark C. Pigott","I think across-the-board we had good orders, good productivity coming out of our factories. There was some element of improved pricing. I think we touched on that in the earlier question in North America. It was just a very good quarter all the way around. Parts are good, finance was good, I think everything contributed to a very good quarter.","Henry Kirn - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then as we go into '12 for Europe, not to kill the topic, but is it possible to get a little more granularity around expectations by region within Europe? And then maybe the cadence of demand, as we go in 2012, as we sit here now.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think -- we're -- of course we're in Europe in a big way. We're in every single country, and it's a complicated subject in terms of what's going to happen for the market. That's why we gave a range of $2.10 to $2.40, which is down from the $2.44 a year ago. But I mean, you see the news every day, every week, every month, there's a slightly different or modified approach to dealing with some of the more troubled countries. I think in terms of our specific industry, there's a lot of freight out there. There's a lot of people who have -- once again comparable in North America, who have survived the last 10 years are in good position. They've got good, solid operations. There's very, very few cancellations. So people are just cautious about what's going to be happening. But they're ordering trucks, they like the trucks, they would like to order more. We've got big -- a couple of big truck shows going on this year in Europe. It will be I think exciting to see how those progress. But there's just the overhanging points about the general macroeconomic and political structure, how that's going to shake out. You talk with the customers, they're loving our trucks, they would like to buy more. I think once things clear up, they will buy more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, a few questions. The first is kind of a detailed one on the quarter, and then the others are kind of looking forward. On Q4, can you give us the revenue and gross profit split between truck and parts, please?","Mark C. Pigott","The gross profit for the margin percentages?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, no. If you could give -- and I know you gave it typically in the 10-Q and will in the 10-K. I'm just wondering what the revenue contribution and gross profit contribution, if you could give it just for parts, that would be very helpful.","Mark C. Pigott","We can. We don't have it right on hand. Can we take it off-line?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You bet. And then near term, within that slight decrease that's discussed for Q1 volumes and appreciating the relative share gain that you've had against strengthening in the aftermarket, could you help us understand PACCAR's latitude to increase production? Specifically what I'm looking at is, given the average monthly production in Q4 appears to be about 3% below the average monthly production that you achieved in 2006, and I know there's been a change...","Mark C. Pigott","2006?","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I'm going back to the peak year.","Mark C. Pigott","That's fun.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I'm wondering, can you maintain your current share if the volume goes back to that 2006 level over the next 2 years?","Mark C. Pigott","Now that is an excellent question. And I think that's an important point that PACCAR is and has been for 106 and 107 years focused on being the best quality, productivity, innovation technology. That is our focus. And if we had this conversation 25 years ago, our market share would've been, let's call it, 10% to 12% instead of 28%. And what I think has happened, gradually over time, is that the benefits of excellent productivity and services in terms of the products and services that we offer, more and more customers are saying, \"You know, there really is an advantage to purchasing Peterbilt, DAF, PACCAR Parts, PacLease, PACCAR Financial. Whatever it is, there are some advantages in terms of helping me as a customer perform better.\" So as the market goes up, our goal is to continue to provide those outstanding services and sort of the share takes care of itself. As I say, this is a record share. It's not something that we've said over years and years of conference calls that this is our goal that we want to get. It's happened because our customers said, \"We love your products.\" So if we go back to a 360,000-unit market, which I don't see, maybe you do, we'll produce as much as we can, but the more important criteria is always at the highest quality.","Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, this is a bit of a longer-term question and it's kind of been out there in discussions in investor circles, could you kind of weigh in on your view as to whether the EU could potentially have a U.S.-style prebuy in front of the Euro 6? I mean, typically the region doesn't really react that way.","Mark C. Pigott","No, that's a good question, obviously something that we spent a bunch of time reviewing. And I think as you've indicated, typically they don't have that much of a prebuy. I would say that sometimes there is vocation-specific prebuys. Well a couple of things are going on. First of all, and I think this will be an advantage for -- certainly for PACCAR, is that you're now getting to a point in 2013 and sort of after that where the engine technology and the emission standards will be very closely aligned. And I think that will be good for almost all manufacturers and certainly for us rather than working to an EPA standard into a Euro standard, so that'll be good. In some countries in Europe offer a, let's call it, environmental incentive to try to persuade customers to purchase earlier because the engine will be more environmentally friendly. Some countries just don't do that. A lot of times, the new environmental regulations come with a cost, and we've talked about that over the last year or 2. And so that sometimes stimulates a prebuy. Typically in North America, it's more of a laissez faire capitalistic approach. There's no incentive. So there is a prebuy because people say, \"I don't think I want to pay 8,000, 10,000, 12,000. Euro 6 is going to have an increase of -- you've seen the press, probably EUR 10,000 to EUR 15,000 and so that might -- it might have some people saying, \"I'll do a bit of a prebuy.\" But right now, very few countries -- I think Switzerland, but very few countries have weighed in saying, \"Here's an incentive to get a Euro 6 early.\" So I probably won't expect too much going in Europe. And by the way, it's January 1, 2014 is the new date for the mission change in Europe. So you're still 2 years away.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss from Buckingham Research.","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I want to ask a really bad question because all the good questions aren't really getting answered.","Mark C. Pigott","Joel, we're counting on you.","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right. Well at least, I got to be consistent. Can you give us what the geographic mix of the Other segment is, a little more color on that?","Mark C. Pigott","For Other, as in Australia and countries around the world? Is that really what you're asking?","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Yes, and even if you want to do sort of fuss it up so we don't really get any information to like Asia, Latin America, rest of the world or whatever you may do.","Michael T. Barkley","Sure. You could primarily see the Mexico, Australia and the Andean region of South America, which would be countries like Colombia, Ecuador and so forth.","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So would Latin America be more than half of it?","Michael T. Barkley","No, I don't think it would be more than half of it, but it would be 1\/3 of it maybe.","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, yes. So -- and we -- as I mentioned, that includes Mexico and Australia where -- we've been there for 50 years, a long time. We are seeing some good growth in the Andean region, particularly in Colombia, where we have about 50% market share. That's going very, very well. We've added a distribution center in Santiago, Chile. So that market is growing. And typically, those products are -- a lot of them are made in our Mexican factory. And then out of Australia, you might sell some -- well, we sell some to New Zealand. We sell some to, say, Papua New Guinea. We don't really -- so those would be the primary markets in Other.","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then what about the goal for 3 to 5 years? Where do you think your global mix, and now you can include the U.S. and Europe?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think the biggest investment going on right now is obviously in Brazil. And we've indicated openly that we want to initially get to 10% share. And if you've got a market of 125,000 units for Brazil, that's 12,500 trucks right there. And we'd like to grow it further, but it's early days for us. We're just starting to put our dealer network in position. We're just literally beginning the preliminary construction of the factory. So that will take time, but that will be a good-size market. Then there's sort of the large market of China, which we are continuing to add people to and we're selling engines and we're selling trucks primarily into the vocational natural resource segment. That's still the biggest market in the world this year, probably about 800,000 units, which is pretty large. It's lower than 1.1 million, but it's still an excellent market. And I think the challenge there and kind of what's interesting is how the commercial truck industry will respond to a market that's down 10% to 15%. Will there be consolidation? The government owns all the truck makers. Is it going to be a natural consolidation, or will it be government-directed? There's still no profit being generated in the commercial vehicle manufacturing segment. So it's a -- if you pick the wrong partner and the government decides that partner should be consolidated, you might have picked the wrong one. So it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next 3 to 5 years in China.","Joel G. Tiss - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And last one, how much do you expect to spend on your global expansion initiatives in 2012 roughly?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, probably less than $50 million. And a big chunk of that will be building a factory in Brazil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies & Company.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Most are asked and answered, so let me just -- a couple of details. We had talked in some previous quarters about some issues with your supply chain kind of struggling to keep up. Can you just update us on that?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. That's a good question, Steve. I would say that most of the suppliers have responded in a positive fashion. They've seen -- I'm talking particularly in North America right now, but they've seen pretty steady orders and demand from us and other OEMs. In fact, obviously increasing. So they've been able to feel a little more confident about hiring people back, maybe taking on a second shift, investing in some capacity, whatever their particular need is. And I'm just feeling a little bit better as they go into '12 with the, let's call it the U.S. economy or GDP growing at, let's call it 2% plus. Even the car business is now starting to bounce back a little bit. I think suppliers are positive, and so I think the challenge is probably last summer and early fall where many suppliers were just still not convinced that this market was going to continue. They've now probably mostly come to the realization that market looks to be pretty good.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So in other words, they're kind of catching up and delivering on time and on schedule?","Mark C. Pigott","That is correct.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Excellent. So second question is maybe a little longer. I know you've seen 1 or 2 cycles under your belt and...","Mark C. Pigott","In the last 5 years.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Exactly. And it seems like you have some pretty positive outlook on sort of the fundamentals here but predictably, some investors are starting to question whether 2012 or '13 could be the peak of the current cycle. And I just wondered if you might have a view on the longevity potential here.","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think these cycles tend to run in about sort of 5-year intervals. I think there was an earlier question about some leverage and how we're doing. I mean, I think to generate over $1 billion in net income our fourth best year in a market that is about half of the record levels is really a remarkable result. I think we've got definitely some ways to run. There's a lot of segments of the economy that are still at the pretty low levels. We talked about housing is at, what, 50 year lows. That's a big driver for so many industries, and a lot of those industries are dependent on trucks. Cars production, which is another big driver for a lot of industries and you're talking rubber, electronics, steel, aluminum, glass, et cetera. They hit a high of $17 million and then dropped down about $10 million and now they're thinking about $13 million. So they're, let's call it, 3 quarters of the way back to record levels. So I think in some of these things, there's a little more confidence and we get some positive, pro-business, government outlook that the whole economy in North America could be pretty good for a number of years. But it's a cyclical business. Not every top of the cycle will be a record. I know it's nice to have that in the economist's world but unfortunately in the real world, it's just not that way. But replacement demand, which we have not seen for 5 years, we're certainly hoping to get to it this year. Let's call it 225,000 units. But when you get the economy operating positively in all cylinders, it would be very exciting for the truck industry. We're ready for it. Our factories are the most efficient and productive they've ever been. Our dealers are the strongest. We've got more new products. We're in more segments than ever before. So we're looking forward to it.","Stephen E. Volkmann - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Sounds good. And I guess if that were to happen in the past, you've gotten very, very close to about a 15% gross margin. Is there any reason not to think that could happen again?","Mark C. Pigott","I think we would -- we're basically at 13% right now and the market's half what it was, so absolutely.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two quick questions. One, longer term, Mark, can you just elaborate on your strategy to build out the distribution network in Brazil with regards to your DAF dealers and the potential investment required? And then just a shorter-term question, just to reconfirm, so basically in response to Jerry's question, you're saying incremental margins and gross margins could be flat to down for the full year relative to 2011. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly.","Mark C. Pigott","That -- yes, I'll take the second one first. That is correct, depending on what's going on in Europe, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just -- sorry, second longer-term question?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. Yes, on the Brazil distribution, that's an exciting process, kind of spring boarding off an earlier answer. One of the real advantages that we bring and is sort of reiterated by many of our dealers is that with an independent dealer network, there's a lot more profit potential for an entrepreneur to be a dealer of ours versus our competitors. And I think you can see that not just in our industry, but just any industry. So we have obviously -- have the groundbreaking. You've got the press release. We're investing the money, we bought the land and for the last year or so, I've been working very avidly on getting the distribution framework in place. We now have the framework, and we're getting excellent response and that is -- there are every state from Amazonia down to the south of Brazil has trucks. We want to cover every state from early days of production, which is mid-2013. We've laid out the criteria in terms of what we're looking for and to have a dealership, it's a $5 million type of investment because you need a number of acres of land. You need a facility, you've got to hire the people. But in exchange for that, you've got a good, wide geographic territory that you will control. We bring in what we consider some great products and services, distribution centers, financing the parts back up. And we're getting a great response from some competitor dealers who are finding they have very limited opportunity to generate profit, from industrial dealers who are used to equipment sales, from agricultural dealers who obviously are used to tractors, trailers and construction and ag equipment. So it's a wide range. And even some automotive dealers who may be in the heavier range of the automotive sector. What's interesting, and you probably appreciate this, Jamie, I know you've traveled a lot, is that a number of these dealers have come -- potential dealers have come to North America and come to Europe and talked to our existing dealers and saying, \"What's really going on?\" And they've come to our factories to see the quality and the innovation we put in, and the response has been very, very positive. And they then go back to Brazil and sort of spread the word that, \"Wow, I've talked with a Kenworth, a Peterbilt, a DAF dealer. Yes there's an investment required, but the profitability over the medium and long term is excellent.\" So it's exciting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman from Cleveland Research.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Just a couple of cleanup questions here. I guess first in Europe, could you speak to what dealer inventory levels look like and what the company's own truck inventory levels look like today?","Mark C. Pigott","Sure. In terms of our own inventory, we basically don't have any inventory. We build to demand so that is not -- so there's nothing really much to talk about there. Dealer inventory is still in very good shape. And we've adjusted our build rates, our production rates, as you know. But the dealers are moving the inventory through their pipeline in a very normal process. The customers have got very good access to credit. There's still a lot of freight being hauled. So the people ordering trucks want those trucks and are putting them into service in a very normal fashion.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And do you believe your competitors' dealer inventory levels are also in good condition?","Mark C. Pigott","I don't really know. I drive by many of my competitors, and sometimes they seem to have a lot of inventory. But I don't think that's a very scientific approach, but we focus on what our dealers are doing.","Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Company","Okay. And then what were the past dues for the quarter? And then also, was there any impact from currency to sales or earnings?","Mark C. Pigott","Okay. On the past dues, we were at 1.5% and currency, let me turn that over to Michael.","Michael T. Barkley","Yes, the currency impacts were pretty small. There was $8 million for the quarter on revenues and about $500,000 for pretax income.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber from RBC Capital Markets.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, just going back to your last answer to the last question, the credit availability in Europe, is that in the industry? Is it available across the industry, or is PACCAR just becoming more aggressive with their own portfolio?","Mark C. Pigott","Well first of all, I think I would say that we probably have the best portfolio of anybody in the industry. So aggressive is not typically a term that I would apply to our portfolio. In fact, I'd say very conservative. And that's why we've generated very low past dues. So I think the credit is pretty much available. When we go to shows at industry, whether we're selling people our trucks or they're buying a competitors', credit is out there. It's available, yes.","Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of going back to Europe, when you tempered your outlook for Europe for next year, I mean, can you just talk about what you saw through the cadence through the fourth quarter and maybe what you've seen here in January and kind of when you decided to make a change to your outlook?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, I think we adjusted our production rate in November. So we were seeing that going into October because it takes a while to adjust the production rates. And I think we've seen that gradual slowing of orders through the end of the year. Obviously, the end of the year, particularly with all the conflicting news coming out about the economic, political activities in Europe, it's very -- there's a lot going on. And now that we're essentially through January, I think we're seeing that more stabilize, but at a lower level. And that's why we've made this adjustment to our production rate. As Scania has, I understand that people like Mercedes and others, they were shut down for close to a month which we haven't done that approach. But it's a whole industry just trying to work through what the ongoing demand. And so in terms of the range of $2.10 to $2.40, that's why we start out the year with a broader range because there's just so much going on. I'd love to see how it shakes out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Rayle from Northcoast Research.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Most of my questions have been answered. On the financing side, great, great quarter in terms of profitability. Was there anything that we should think about from loans issued, say, 2, 3, 4 years ago in terms of tightening the standards, or is it just truly the better profitability of your customers?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Well I think primarily, it's the better profitability of our customers. Their cash flow has improved. It's strong. And so they're able to make their truck payments, and we continue to refine our credit underwriting from -- continually, just like we're doing in our factories. There's always room to improve. We're continually refining our credit underwriting standards, and so we're pleased with our performance portfolio position and where it will progress as we go forward.","Mark C. Pigott","I think I'd just add onto that. I think Ron summed it up very well. We've also continued to invest and strive to be a leader on the technology side of the finance so that we are able to analyze the credit worthiness of our customers, give that to them in a very timely fashion, allow them to access their own accounts electronically, make the payments, look at the scheduling over the next 1, 2, 3 years, how that affects their particular business. So you're actually bringing a valuable add-on benefit. It's not just about who has a rate, but it's who has a service that allows the customers. They could be hauling wheat, they could be hauling electronics. They're all different cycles, and who has a program such as PACCAR Financial or PacLease in a slightly different way that works with the customers' needs. So I think our information technology group, I want to give them a plug right now, PACCAR's #1 Information Technology Company in the country, according to the InformationWeek magazine. I think that's been a real benefit throughout our company.","Brian Michael Rayle - Northcoast Research","Yes, absolutely. Have you seen any difference between the sort of purchaser versus the lease customer, or they have both trended up at the same rate?","Ronald E. Armstrong","I think they both are doing well. I mean I think that, again, the whole freight environment, there's plenty of freight. The rates are good. And so we've seen all of our customers have better cash flow performance in their businesses as we came out of the recession.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Nolan from Deutsche Bank.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just had a couple of quick follow-ups on the Financial Services business. For the full year this year, can you tell us, either for full year or the fourth quarter, what your provisioning versus charge-offs were?","Mark C. Pigott","For most part, our charge-offs are probably comparable to our level of provision. We've seen some provision benefits as our past dues have come out, but our portfolio is growing as well. So all those things sort of worked to offset each other.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So when you look at it on a full year basis this year, there's no reason to think that there's any anomaly as far as low provisioning as you reduce your allowance that wouldn't reoccur next year?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no, I don't think so at all.","Patrick Nolan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just one other thing I noticed. I noticed the Financial Services assets stepped up pretty substantially from Q3 to Q4, even more so than you saw your revenue increase in the truck side of the business. Was there a big tick up in your share of your sales that were running through PACCAR Finance?","Ronald E. Armstrong","Yes, for the year, we ended the year at 31% finance market share compared to 28% last year, so in a good quarter. A lot of customers in servicing units lease units in the fourth quarter because of the tax benefits that are available to those customers. So we had the benefits in our retail lease portfolio, and so it was a good quarter for the finance company.","Mark C. Pigott","I think another point, Patrick, on that is you've been covering the market for a while and you sort of got that ebb and flow in cyclicality of the business that PACCAR Financial and PacLease, we're there every day for the customer. And a few years ago, when we had the calls, some of the focus from the analysts were who's the part of the industry. And there were some fairly big names, some names that only have 1 or 2 letters in their names. They departed the industry and customers, they don't forget that. So I think some of that shared improvement as people have been saying, \"You know what, PACCAR or maybe it was Mr. Kenworth or Peterbilt or DAF, you were there for me during the tough times. Things are improving. I want to continue and even grow that business with you.\" And that -- once again, I think that's a real strength of PACCAR, something that we don't probably get enough play on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","This as Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question. With financing becoming more available, are you seeing more activity in the owner operating market?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, the owner-operator market is a little bit of a misnomer nowadays. And maybe this will be the last quarter that we really talk about it. There are still some entrepreneurs, some companies that will have a handful of trucks. But that's probably 10% of the total market and typically they have aligned themselves with either an end customer or a major freight company because there's just a lot of benefit whether it's cheaper fuel, insurance, healthcare, the availability of freight to haul. So I think we continue to supply everybody that wants our products but it's more and more -- it's called the small, medium and large trucking companies.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up question on your pricing comment earlier. I think you said that you're seeing some good pricing in North America in the fourth quarter. Is that like low single-digit, mid single-digit? Can you provide any additional clarity on that? And then additionally, is that pure price that you're referring to or are there additional components? Is it price per truck going up? Is it pure or is it just additional componentry?","Mark C. Pigott","Good question. I think we're seeing some of the pricing going up and some of that's being driven by the continued strong used truck market. We're now rebounded on used trucks to a level that we saw a number of years ago. So as the used truck values go up, more and more truck companies, operators are saying, \"You know, it may be a good time to trade in. A new truck isn't that much more expensive.\" I mean, it's still -- there's still an increment but with the new truck, I can get better fuel economy, lower operating costs, I don't have to do as much maintenance on it, et cetera, et cetera. So that tends to push up the actual price of the new truck. I don't think that componentry -- we've already kind of worked the componentry in, particularly the after treatment and new emissions. I mean that's -- and we've talked about that for a long time, so let's move off of that. Now it's just people saying, \"Hey, I'd like to get a new truck because there are benefits to it.\" So I think it's -- I don't know what you mean by pure, but the margins we're getting are because people are willing to pay a little higher price for a new truck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Vertical Research Partners.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Two quick questions. One was on just the improved pricing you just -- actually on 2 topics you just touched on, price and mix. On pricing, is it better realization on past increases? Is it mixed between the larger fleets and the medium fleets, or is it a new price increase? And can you mention the last time you took a new actually list increase?","Mark C. Pigott","We typically have a list increase twice a year. Whether all of that list increase generates or translates into more dollars, it depends on the market. But we're always working with our major suppliers who, some of them you carry who seem to like to increase their prices. So we increased our pricing. The more vehicles you buy, it's kind of like anything. If you buy more, you're going to be looking for some better price. And that's very true of the industry in which we compete every day. So typically, if you're buying a couple hundred, pricing will be one element. If you're buying 5 trucks, the pricing is something else. But what we want to make sure is that every customer gets the best product in the industry and delivers them the benefits they need.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. And I guess just to be clear then, you probably did see some improved price realization on past increases in 4Q and would probably presumably roll on another list price increase in 1Q?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that is correct.","Robert Wertheimer - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, perfect. And then just more broadly on industry mix, I'm curious and I understand quite well the owner-operator just being sort of a marginal part of the fleet at this point. There's still this large and medium, or medium and medium-large fleet. Have you seen any shift where the more medium-sized people are starting to come in and especially in the quoting and backlog activity?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I don't see more. I think it's been pretty consistent over the last year. And we do track, as everybody else tracks of what's the size of the customers, but you can also break it down by segment. We mentioned earlier the oil and gas boom, and you're seeing that in a lot of different areas of North America, whether it's Alberta or North Dakota or Texas or Pennsylvania. I mean there's -- it's sort of been a bit of our resurgence going on, which has been great for a lot of our customers. And some of those are small customers, some of those are larger customers. But I think that our people want the product, they see the advantage of the product and there's just a little more confidence in the general population now as the general economy is improving that they're willing to pay a little bit more because they feel that they can charge their end customers a little bit more. So it's sort of a pass-through along the logistics chain.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Denoyer from Wolfe Research.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Quick question on the -- I wanted to follow up on the MX market to your question. In the U.S. and Canada, I think you had said something like, was it 25% to 30%?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, that is correct.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. I've seen some data that looks more like 21% for the year for North America, or are you just looking at...","Mark C. Pigott","That's what we delivered, but we've got obviously lots of engines we're building for customers, so yes.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And did you specify a target for 2012?","Mark C. Pigott","No, no. We're continuing to invest, and we look forward to that growing over time.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then a different question on your comments in the press release on sourcing more components from Asia. Can you give us any sense of maybe what percentage of your material spend is coming from Asia at this point and how that's been changing and what types of components?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, that's a great question. We have increased our purchases, but of course we've also increased -- and from Asia, we also increased our purchases from other parts of the country or other parts of the world as the general markets have improved over the last few years. So I think in dollar terms, we're buying more from Asia. In percent terms, it's probably hasn't changed all that much. But certainly in dollar terms, it has.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. And then one last one on the natural gas -- the oil and gas segment in general, can you give us a rough sense of what percentage of your U.S. and Canada deliveries were to that segment of the market this year and what that has been historically?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes. It's just a few percent of our total production. I mean, let's call it 1% to 2%.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. 1% to 2% even in 2011, which was a very good year?","Mark C. Pigott","Yes, I'd say maybe it's sort of the 1% range, and some months it might actually be lower than that. You're talking about for an LNG, CNG-type of vehicle, right?","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. I was going to ask that as well. I was actually talking about 2 customers like the 2 customers that are doing.","Mark C. Pigott","I don't think I have that number off the top of my head, but that's gone up because they're great companies, Halliburton and Schlumberger and different groups. They are definitely increasing their purchase. I don't have that exact number. LNG, CNG is probably not still less than 1%.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","That actually have a natural gas engine.","Mark C. Pigott","That is correct. I mean it's increased, but it's still a very small number.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","And are those the -- is that the Cummins Westport engine? Is that 9 liter essentially, or is there another engine that you offer?","Mark C. Pigott","I'm not sure on that one. That's -- Westport has carved out a good niche in that marketplace.","Timothy J. Denoyer - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay. Is there a bigger engine, or is just 9 liter that you offer?","Mark C. Pigott","Well there's a 9 liter -- I have to get back to you on that one.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Regan from Levin Capital.","Michael Regan","Quick question. You guys are one of the few companies that truly understand return of capital to shareholders, either in the form of dividends or timely repurchases of shares, has had a huge impact on your total return to shareholders and obviously...","Mark C. Pigott","We appreciate that, Michael. Thank you very much.","Michael Regan","Well, I the question that comes out of that, Mark, is that despite a stepped-up dividend and being more aggressive with the share repurchase, net cash on the balance sheet ended at its highest level perhaps ever in PACCAR's history. And even looking at it as a percent of the total market capital of the company, the highest in 5 years and I'm wondering is there a message in building so much net cash on the balance sheet in terms of concern about where the economy is? Or why, despite again nice moves on the dividends, I actually thought it could have much higher given your cash and the buyback with the shares trading where they are, why not even more aggressive? Why is cash continuing to build by another 22% this year?","Mark C. Pigott","Well, we've got a lot of opportunities but first of all, let me take it on the positive side with the special dividend, with the increase in the quarterly dividend with the repurchases. We believe and many, many shareholders are giving us very positive feedback to keep doing what we're doing. It is a cyclical business. We're not trying to send any message, but we do understand the business very, very well. And you've just seen in Europe within a matter of 3 months a 20% decline. There aren't a whole lot of industries that see moves that quickly to that magnitude. We got some great opportunities. We're going to be investing several hundred million or more down in Brazil. We're still investigating opportunities in Asia. We got a lot of new products. Like many others, we continue to work on. And we want to make sure that we're typically at about 45% to 55% payout rate to our shareholders of our net income. And it seems to be well received by the vast majority of our shareholders, so we keep working it. But I appreciate your points.","Operator","There are no other questions in the queue at this time.

Preston Feight, Harrie Schippers and I will update you on PACCAR's excellent first quarter results and business highlights.","PACCAR reported record revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2019. PACCAR's first quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $6.5 billion and first quarter net income was $629 million an excellent 9.7% after-tax return on revenues. Revenues were 15% higher and net income was 23% higher compared to the first quarter last year.","PACCAR delivered a record 51,500 trucks during the first quarter. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1 billion an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter last year. Parts pre-tax profits were also a record at $208 million. I'm very proud of our 28,000 employees who are passionate about delivering the industry's best products and services to our customers and achieving strong results for our shareholders.","PACCAR continues to outperform its peers and provide strong operating cash flow for reinvestment in future growth and distributions to stockholders. One key measure where PACCAR excels is return on invested capital. In the first quarter, PACCAR achieved a return on invested capital of 25% and over the last five years achieved an annual average return of 22%.","PACCAR has delivered annual dividends of approximately 50% of net income for many years and has paid a dividend every year since 1941. PACCAR has increased it\u2019s quarterly dividend at an average of 11% per year during the last 20 years and raised it another 14% in the first quarter to $0.32 per share. PACCAR repurchased 491,000 of its outstanding shares during the first quarter.","The increase in truck production in the first quarter was primarily due to more build days in North America compared to the fourth quarter and good supplier performance. Truck and Parts gross margins were 15% in the first quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization of 3%.","Our Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF factories and purchasing and supplier management teams did a fantastic job of managing production delivering a record number of trucks and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry. In the second quarter, we're expecting deliveries to be 2% to 4% higher than the first quarter due to increased production in North America. Truck, Parts and other gross margins in the second quarter are estimated to be in a range of 14.5% to 15%.","Preston Feight will now provide an update on DAF and PACCAR Parts.","Preston Feight","Thanks, Ron. DAF achieved record market share of 17.1% in the first quarter. European economies and freight transport activity are projected to grow at a moderate pace in 2019. This year should be another good year in the European heavy truck market with registrations in a range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks.","Turning to PACCAR Parts global results. Parts first quarter revenues were a record and for the first time reached the $1 billion level. As Ron mentioned, Parts quarterly pretax profit was a record $208 million.","PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. This combined with consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer focused technologies has created a very strong foundation for growth in PACCAR Parts. To support this growth, PACCAR Parts has begun construction of two new parts distribution centers. One in Ponta Grossa Brazil and the other one is in Las Vegas, Nevada. We expect Part sales to grow 5% to 8% for the full year 2019.","Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on Kenworth, Peterbilt and PACCAR Financial Services.","Harrie Schippers","Thanks Preston. The U.S. economy and freight tonnage continue to grow this year. A consensus of economists predicts two point -- GDP and 2.6% industrial production growth for the full year 2019. First quarter GDP growth was a strong 3.2%. Freight tonnage increased 3.8% in the first quarter, compared to a year earlier. This provides a healthy backdrop for the 2019 truck market. First quarter 2019 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales increased 23%, compared to the same period last year. We have increased the midpoint of the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market projection to over 300,000 units due to the strong industry backlog.","PACCAR Financial Services pretax income was $84 million in the first quarter, an increase of 24% compared to a year earlier. First quarter revenues were $350 million. PACCAR Financial Services assets increased to a record $14.9 billion with the portfolio performing well. Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 used truck values increased again in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values command a 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles.","In 2019, we're increasing capital investments to $625 million to $675 million and R&D expenses to $320 million to $340 million. We're investing in new products and expanded facilities while increasing our funding for alternative powertrain development. As we mentioned in the press release, DAF has recently introduced electric and hybrid vehicles that are undergoing field testing throughout Europe. Peterbilt and Kenworth are also working on hydrogen fuel cell, hybrid and the electric powertrains as well as autonomous vehicle technology in collaboration with our Silicon Valley Innovation Center.","Thank you.

And as we saw in the first quarter, registrations in the European market were up over last year and you'll continue to see a good market for this year for the full year as our forecast indicates.","Q \u2013 Jerry Revich","And so, your orders then are up year-over-year to support the comment about share gains of the market, so at healthy levels and you folks are picking up share that's in the order book, Ron?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yes, the actual order intake is down a bit over the -- last year was a very strong first quarter. So order intake is down similar to levels we've seen with our other European competitors.","Q \u2013 Jerry Revich","Okay. And then in the U.S. business, can you talk about whether you've seen any shifts in the production request from your customers? Or are you seeing any folks looking to get earlier in the queue or later in the queue relative to the production plan? I guess how fluid is the backlog situation in North America? And how firm is the production plan for the third quarter as you see it?","Ron Armstrong","I think it's all very firm. So I think all the movement of trucks in and out is just very normal and the backlog is very firm.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then from an SG&A standpoint, you folks were able to keep SG&A flat on really strong sales growth, I'm wondering is there any comp dynamic going on in the year ago period? Or if you folks as you continue production year-over-year can maintain a flat SG&A. Any moving pieces for us to think about?","Ron Armstrong","Well, as you know, Jerry rigorous cost management is something that we're very focused on and managing that over the cycle. There was some benefit in the quarter from some currency movement, but for the most part it's just our ongoing focus on managing our cost for the entire cycle.","Jerry Revich","Strong performance, Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open.","Joel Tiss","How is it going guys?","Ron Armstrong","Good, Joel. You?","Joel Tiss","Hanging in there. So I keep hearing you guys are gaining market share in parts, and some of your dealers are gaining market share in parts. And I just wonder if you can illuminate for us a little bit who is losing share? Or is there just such a big opportunity out there for everybody that there is a lot more room to keep going?","Ron Armstrong","I think a lot of that share gain comes from our engines where we've been in the engine business in North America. This is our ninth year and so the -- as a percent of the total population of engines, the PACCAR MX engine is just becoming a bigger portion. And so that engine business is a nice add-on. Plus the \u2013 we now have 175 or so TRP stores around the globe and so that enables the parts group to get more penetration with all-makes customers trailers, buses, et cetera. So I think those are probably the two key drivers of share growth in the parts arena.","Joel Tiss","So the more the pirates I guess who are losing out?","Ron Armstrong","Excuse me?","Joel Tiss","The pirates like the third-party, like non-OEM guys are the ones who are losing out?","Ron Armstrong","On the TRP side that would -- it could be the WDs, it could be other OEs. I don't know.","Joel Tiss","Okay. And also can you talk a little bit about what you guys have been working on for the last couple of years to handle -- we've been hearing about a potential slowdown in fourth quarter production levels, and can you just give us a little sense of how you guys can work your decremental margins and your cost structure to balance that out?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah, I mean we're full ahead on our production. We're going to continue to produce trucks. We -- as I said the backlog is firm. The demand, we're quoting business into 2020. So full ahead for us and we're -- we've -- because we -- as we mentioned earlier, we manage that cost structure prudently during all times -- all phases of the cycle. We've proven historically that we can manage our cost structure quite efficiently and this will be no exception. We'll be able to manage that quite effectively with our factories and with our other operations.","Joel Tiss","Thanks. And just one last one. Sorry to hog up all the time. Can you talk a little bit about Brazil, I see you highlighted it and where your market share is and what the market looks like for the next year or two there? Thank you, and then I'm done.","Ron Armstrong","Yeah, so we're at 6.7% share last year. Similar in the first quarter, we are continuing to increase our production. We produced over 1,000 trucks in the first quarter. In 2018, we basically doubled production from the prior year and we'll be in a similar kind of scale this year for 2019. So we -- the product has just been very well-received by all of our customers and the industry as a whole and we've been recognized as the brand of the year for the last three years.","So, we have great dealership representatives. We've got a good network to support the trucks. And so, we're continuing to improve our positioning there. And we're also expanding our Parts and service presence and we're going to add a 160,000 square-foot PDC that will be opening probably in early first half of 2020.","We've been using part of our truck factory as a Parts warehouse. So, we need to grow that. And support that. So, the future is very bright for our Brazilian operations.","Q \u2013 Joel Tiss","That\u2019s awesome. Thank you.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Hi. Good morning. Quick question, the second quarter you have deliveries up 4%, but you're implying gross margins flat to down. Can you help explain that?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yeah. So, the truck margins are in the 12%, 12.5% range. First quarter the truck margins were 12.5%. So, a lot of the incremental revenue will come from the truck side. And so, that wading effect of trucks versus Parts, will sort of keep us in a similar range as to the first quarter.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Okay. Thank you. And then also, I noticed the CapEx increase, but you'll hold the R&D, or actually even tweaked it a little lower. And I am just trying to say -- this might be a question more for the meeting coming up in May.","But, just trying to understand with all the new drivetrain technology and so forth, and for a long time people have always wondered, how the R&D as a percent of sales is so low for PACCAR.","Can you help explain is there some capitalization of some of these dollars that maybe some people might think would be expenses R&D, can you just help us a little bit with the divergence between the CapEx increase and the R&D?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yeah. The CapEx increase is purely just as we've gotten into the year, the ability of our teams to move things forward has gone quicker than what we anticipated. Our plans are still pretty much the same. But we're actually going to be able to get things done quicker than what we'd originally anticipated.","So, that's the capital increase. The R&D is, just part of how we prudently manage our product development efforts and have for years. We're probably going to spend a record amount of R&D for our company this year.","But it's well thought out well positioned. And we feel good about we're doing everything we need to do to support the future needs for greenhouse gas changes, future products and also the advanced powertrain arena.","So, I think we feel really good about what we're doing and the things that we're investing in both on the capital and R&D side.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Well, I think this is an important issue, because people are trying to figure out the cost pressures on the company with potentially some volume declines coming in the next year or two. So the divergence of -- we were able to pull things forward, and thus the CapEx goes up, but not the R&D? ","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","The R&D has gone up.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Can you help us understand a little better the \u2013 No. but the change, the change from the start of the year that caused the CapEx to go up hasn't had a commensurate increase in the R&D?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yeah because the plans and projects that we're working on hasn't changed, It's just the pace at which those capital projects are being executed, and the ability to get those done quicker than what we had originally anticipated. So, there was no change in the projects. It's just recognition of the timing of incurring those capital-related costs.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Can we -- I guess we can dive into this more in the May meeting. But I think the idea is sure if there's CapEx-related costs for the new introductions. The R&D has stayed at a relatively low level.","And I think the ability to continue to do that the next couple of years or lack thereof is a big discussion around the earnings resiliency. So, I'll look forward to going to a little more detail in May.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Sure. Okay.","Q \u2013 David Raso","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yeah. Thanks David.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Steven Fisher","Thanks and Good morning. So Harrie\u2026","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Steven Fisher","Morning, Harrie, mentioned that used truck values are up year-over-year. I am curious on used truck inventories. How do the levels in Q1 compare to Q4 2018 both on your own lots and on dealer lots and what you're expecting for the used truck market later this year as trade-ins likely keep coming in?","A \u2013 Harrie Schippers","Used truck inventories are I think almost the same level as they were at the end of last year. The amount for used trucks in -- especially in North America has been really good. We see good pricing, good demand for premium trucks. So...","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","And we're continuing to fill out our used truck locations. We're going to be adding a new location on the property where our factory is located to further supplement our ability to sell used trucks and we're the biggest used truck seller for Peterbilt and Kenworth vehicles and we'll continue to support those excellent residual values.","Q \u2013 Steven Fisher","Okay. And then I know you guys generally frame oil and gas as being really only a very modest contributor to earnings. But curious just on order trends in oil and gas for trucks and how the capacity expansion of pipelines later this year might affect some of the market assumptions you might have?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Yes, if there is pipeline capacity expansion and more importantly, if there's infrastructure program that gets approved, that will be where the vocational truck leader in North America and both of those things would be big pluses for our business. But as we said, the backlog for this year is very firm.","Q \u2013 Steven Fisher","Okay, great, thanks very much.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Jamie Cook","Hi good morning. I know you talked about price -- price realization in the quarter of 3%. I think you said which was pretty good. Can you just -- was that better than your expectations? And sort of what are your assumptions for the remainder of the year? And then my second question, understanding a very good visibility into 2019, just based on conversations you're having with your customers, what are they saying about 2020? Is it in line with industry forecasts? And then I guess last congratulations Ron and Preston. But Preston any initial views on -- as you take over any top priorities? Thank you.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","I'll let Preston go first or I can start with the back then.","A \u2013 Preston Feight","No. I think that PACCAR has been performing exceptionally well. We're a long history. We've a great team in place, bringing great results, good strategy and we plan to continue with that.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","So back on the truck pricing, I think on a year-over-year basis, I think we'll see similar comparison when you look back to the same quarter of the prior year, similar performance that offsets some increases in cost, but I think we'll see similar performance of what we saw in the first quarter.","Q \u2013 Jamie Cook","And then just color on what your customers are saying about 2020 relative to what industry forecasts are saying?","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Well, I mean, we're having negotiations with customers on an ongoing basis about 2020 delivery. So and I think there's still recognition that the economy is good, the demand for freight is good, discussions with customers, people that need to haul freight it's -- there's still a pretty tight market to be able to get things delivered on a timely basis. So we're preparing for a continuation of the good market conditions into 2020.","A \u2013 Harrie Schippers","And with all the improvements in greenhouse gas emissions, our customers keep seeing that the trucks we're building today deliver up to 15% better fuel economy than the trucks they bought four years ago and that really helps them when they have to decide in replacing their equipment.","Q \u2013 Jamie Cook","Okay, thank you. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","A \u2013 Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Q \u2013 Joe O'Dea","Hi good morning. You continue to post share gains in Europe this quarter. Can you just give a little bit of detail within the region, where you're seeing some of that progress and then, if there's any mix effect within that as well? Are you seeing a little bit better traction with some of the larger fleets in Europe?","A \u2013 Preston Feight","Yes I'll take that one. really having excellent broad performance across Europe, but it's exceptionally strong in Poland, and the UK has produced nice results this year. I think that we, as DAF have the best trucks, operating the best life cycle cost for our customers, and that's being worn out with the performance of them in the market, and we're seeing the fleets recognize that now. So we're gaining share with some of the larger fleets in Europe, and growing broadly throughout Europe. That's what's leading to this strong performance.","Q \u2013 Joe O'Dea","And then, on the CapEx front and the investment in the engine plants, is that tied at all to things you see on the horizon as an opportunity to really catalyze the next stage of engine penetration for you? I don't know whether that's related to Phase 2 or anything else. But we saw the initial progress on share gains since the launch in 2010 that plateaued a bit kind of wondering what you see on the horizon, both contributing toward making the investments now and kind of triggering some potential share gains?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. Basically, we're selling every engine that we can produce, and so we need the additional capacity in our factories, and we need the additional capacity with our suppliers. So that's where the investment is focused, so we can go to those next plateaus and deliver great engines to our customers.","Q \u2013 Joe O'Dea","Got it. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","Neil Frohnapple","Hi. Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups from earlier questions. So if I recall PACCAR was the first in the industry to cut production in the fourth quarter of 2015 ahead of the 2016 decline in Class 8 production. You guys obviously still sound pretty positive on the fundamentals, but the industry is chewing through the backlog at a quick pace. So curious on what you're looking at, and whether you'll start to take down the daily build rate later this year. Do you need Class 8 orders to rise in the summer, early fall time frame? Just any more thoughts there would be helpful.","Ron Armstrong","The back -- as I said, the backlog's firm we're moving full ahead. So...","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. And then, you guys are continuing to build momentum in Brazil. What are the plans on launching more products in the region for some of the lower weight classes of vehicles?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. That's certainly on the drawing board and part of our process. We've obviously been balancing our entry into the market, and as we continue to grow and expand our business, we'll be introducing new products just like we do in all markets around the world to continue to enhance our position in that market as well. So yeah, that's definitely on our roadmap.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. And then, one last one, Ron. So it sounds like the supplier constraints are largely improved. I mean are they completely behind at this point, or is that still an opportunity to benefit the margins as we move through the year?","Ron Armstrong","We're going to continue to work very closely with our suppliers to continue to move up our build rates in the second quarter and third quarters in North America, and so it's always an orchestrated effort with our suppliers. We feel good about -- obviously the performance in the first quarter was much better than what we saw in the second half of the year, and we expect that to continue for the rest of this year.","Neil Frohnapple","Okay. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ross Gilardi","Thanks, guys.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","Ross Gilardi","Good morning. I was just wondering if I can get some of your thoughts on how they're evolving in alternative powertrain? What are you in-sourcing versus outsourcing? And as things develop, are you leaning more towards doing more in-house versus outsourcing and why?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. I think it's a real exploratory time with respect to a lot of the new technologies, and we're taking multiple paths in terms of developing our own internal capabilities, working closely with a variety of suppliers who are developing their capabilities. As we progress over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll be sort of figuring out what the best path is for us for the long-term.","And there's still quite a bit of challenge with respect to the economic viability of some of these powertrain choices, and can they survive without high degree of subsidization? So in our mind it's still early days. I know we have a lot of customers who want to have some initial trucks to have in their fleet so they can understand the capability and we're supporting those and so we'll continue to explore our avenues. And as I say the next 12 to 24 months will be critical for us to sort of define our way forward.","Ross Gilardi","What about Ron your Silicon Valley office? What are you learning out there particularly on the autonomous development?","Ron Armstrong","A lot. When we first made the decision to open that office that was -- it was clear there was a lot of research that was being done on that area. And so our team in Silicon Valley -- that's where we're really developing our internal capabilities for autonomy. We have a great team there and they're really working closely with some third-party suppliers to develop our own packages. And then as I said, we're working with others who have their packages and want to incorporate those into our vehicles.","And so we have multiple paths that we're working on there, but the Silicon Valley office and Silicon Valley team has been very helpful, as well as our technical teams and our tech center up here in Mount Vernon in Washington and in Eindhoven. They're all working together quite well to help further our efforts and be smarter about what's possible and all the things you have to think about to accomplish successful implementation.","Ross Gilardi","And then just lastly geographically I mean now that you've had the real success with Brazil and gotten that off the ground. And I think when you originally launched that investment the idea was you get to a 10% market share in first five years or so and you seem like you're well on the path to doing that. Might we hear something relatively soon about other geographies be it China and India which you've talked about on and off for years. Are you getting any closer to making investment in one of those regions?","Ron Armstrong","Well the way I think every day that goes by we're a day closer. But there's nothing on the horizon. We continue to -- we have offices in Beijing, we have offices in Shanghai, we have an office in Pune, India with hundreds of employees working in those areas and they're providing valuable support for sourcing from suppliers for engineering technology, embedded software. So we get a lot of support from those teams and we make a lot of trips and have a lot of discussions with potential partners both on the OEM side, the component side to evaluate what -- where's that opportunity that's going to provide us a good return for our shareholders. And so we'll continue to evaluate, because it is -- they are large markets and there's opportunity there. It just has to be a situation that's going to make sense for us as a company and provide us a reasonable return.","Ross Gilardi","Okay, great. look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of weeks. Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Wertheimer","Hi, good morning to you.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning, Rob.","Rob Wertheimer","Just a quick follow-up you discussed the parts business where you've a long run of success in both improving revenues and margins. Has the mix of those more proprietary engine parts been a material contributor to your margin gains? Or has that been more operational? Is the mix on the come still? I don't know if you're willing to segment that margin gain? But that's the question.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I think there has been a positive impact on the margin performance of our operations in North America. Europe we've always had our own engine and so we've enjoyed those margins for quite some time and we've seen margin enhancement in North America as a result of selling -- the engine parts sales have sort of outsized the total growth in North America and so that's a contributor.","Rob Wertheimer","And then have we seen that gain flow through from the market share gain you've had on your engine in North America? Or I don't know the full lag of when Part sales come versus the engine? I hope there still some maturity come in that margin mix? Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Yes, so I mean as the engines mature and you get to -- we're getting to the point now where you're starting to get into more replacement and overhaul kinds of activities for our engines and so we're just starting to see the benefits of that phase of the aftermarket opportunity.","Rob Wertheimer","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.","Adam Uhlman","Good morning, everybody and congrats on all the records. And congrats on the retirement, Ron and Preston.","Ron Armstrong","Yeah.","Adam Uhlman","First to start with the step-up in CapEx for the year. I might have missed it earlier on the call. But what exact projects were pulled forward? Is this the paint facility or some of the distribution centers you're landing in this year? Or could you expand on that a bit, please?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. There's really nothing -- I guess, I would say no projects pulled forward. It's just the execution of the projects that we have been planning all along. We have new PDCs, we have factory expansions, we had a nice grand -- groundbreaking for the Chillicothe paint shop. And those things are just that -- we're going to be able to get those projects done faster and moving quicker than what we had originally anticipated. So, our spending it's just -- is purely just a matter of the timing of the spend. Those have always been part of our plan.","Adam Uhlman","Gotcha. Thank you. And then, with the build rates expected to be up 2% to 4% sequentially in the second quarter, could you help us understand how that plays out between North America and Europe?","And then, I guess I think you'd mentioned a minute ago that builds would be increasing again in the third quarter for North America. Did I hear that right, and by how much? Thanks. ","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. I think what we'll see is -- the production that 2% to 4% is pretty much all North America-driven. And I think in the third quarter we'd probably see a similar level of production. We have the two-week summer shutdown at DAF in the third quarter. So that -- we'll see a reduction in production in Europe, but it should be for the most part offset by production levels in North America.","Adam Uhlman","Okay. Gotcha. Thanks. And then just a clarification. I think you mentioned that the orders were down in Europe. Could you tell us by about how much? And what the orders in North America have been looking like year-over-year?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. The orders in North America are -- because of the strength of the backlog. They're reflective of just the customers that are really filling in the few open slots that exist for 2019, but mostly it's for 2020 build. And again, in Europe, we saw a reduction in orders from -- last year's first quarter was when the backlog really got built up for DAF and so we saw a reduction in first quarter to -- I guess, I can say more normal levels of order intake.","Adam Uhlman","Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Rob Salmon","Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott.","Ron Armstrong","Hi, Rob.","Rob Salmon","With a quick follow-up on -- in terms of the North America production outlook that you guys are expecting to ramp up. You guys generated some very good incremental margins that I'm backing into on the truck in the first quarter. Should we be thinking about similar incremental margins as we look out into the second quarter based on the roughly 3% pricing you guys were talking to as the production ramps as well?","Ron Armstrong","Yeah. I'd say similar. I mean, it depends a little bit on the customer mix, the model mix, the geography mix, so there's lot of factors that weight into that. So something in a similar range would be.","Rob Salmon","And the past couple quarters, on the finance side you guys have had very low provisions for losses on receivables. Is this a good run rate looking forward based on your outlook of the market at around 0.6% of revenue? Or should we be expecting that to kind of move as we look forward?","Ron Armstrong","Well, I mean, because of the strength of the freight markets, our customers have enjoyed excellent performance. Our credit teams and our finance teams have done a lot of work to really apply lot of intelligent data analytics to our credit underwriting. We feel really good about the capabilities there. And so as long as the economy is good, the freight markets are good the portfolio will continue to perform very well. We've seen improvement in used trucks and -- the portfolio is growing. The team has some great technology that they've made available to our customers and, so I think all of that is playing to our finance company's capabilities and performance.","Rob Salmon","That makes sense. And can you remind me -- your used truck pricing was up in the quarter and the type of volumes that you guys saw?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it was up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. I don't have the used truck volumes last year. For 2018, we sold about 15,000 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF used trucks and so that's 3,000 to 4,000 a quarter, so I would guess that we're probably somewhere in the 3,000 3,500 range for used trucks sales in the first quarter.","Rob Salmon","Thank you. Appreciate the time.","Ron Armstrong","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Seth Weber","Hey, good morning, guys.","Ron Armstrong","Good morning.","Seth Weber","Just a quick -- couple of quick follow-ups. I guess just thinking about the Parts business again, I mean, would you -- do you think it's fair to think about that business being -- that business could be up next year even if new truck demand is lower is my first question.","Ron Armstrong","That surely would be our aim. Again, we're continuing to add additional TRP stores. We're continuing to add additional Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer locations, adding locations in markets like Brazil and other areas and so our goal is to continue to have the new programs in place, the additional technology to continue to build that business throughout all cycles.","Seth Weber","Okay, so you think like a low to mid single-digit kind of number for next year is reasonable?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, it's probably a little bit early to commit to something.","Seth Weber","Okay. Fair enough. And then just going back to the pricing and the incremental margin questions. I mean are you assuming that input costs kind of stay where they are for the rest of the year? I mean, I guess , some companies are talking about input costs coming down for balance of the year or so. Just trying to kind of frame operating leverage coming from...","Ron Armstrong","I think that our assumption is probably a pretty steady input cost. We have most of our components are purchased under long-term agreements and so it takes a little while to blend cost movements into the cost of the vehicles et cetera. So I think that's pretty much our assumption is a pretty stable cost environment.","Seth Weber","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open.","Faheem Sabeiha","Hi. Good morning. And congrats on a great quarter. ","Ron Armstrong","Thank you. ","Faheem Sabeiha","Just a question on the MX production. Is there maybe some plans or inability to accelerate that production capacity coming online sooner? It just seems like with your share remaining in the -- where it's at now exiting the cycle could maybe stall engine parts growth opportunity that you laid out in your Investor Day last year?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, as a company we produced last year 97,500 engines which is the highest that we've ever produced and obviously of that -- every one of those -- DAF had record production and so every DAF truck has a PACCAR engine. And so as time goes on we'll have -- see more penetration of those engines into Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks and we are -- we've committed the money to get the capacity in place as quickly as we can. I think most of that will be being implemented in the 2019-2020 time frame for having full availability at the 2021-ish time frame.","Faheem Sabeiha","Okay. And kind of adding to Seth's question, I guess, with the looming decline in Class 8 production, do you think say a more favorable price cost environment, lower premium freight costs and lower over time to the extent you're at that level today will maybe offset the decline in volumes when you look at your gross margin next year?","Ron Armstrong","Yes, I -- the demand for trucks is there and we're all ahead and as I had mentioned before when things do adjust down we've proven over many, many cycles that we're very adapt at managing through those. So we'll continue to execute that very well at whatever point that may happen.","Faheem Sabeiha","Okay. Thanks.","Ron Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company?","Ken Hastings","Yes, we'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."]}}
