[Operator Instructions] I would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Richard Kinder","Thank you, Denise. Before we begin, as usual I'd like to remind you that KMI's earnings release today and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking statements.","Before turning the call over to Steve and the team, let me begin this call by touching upon the state of the energy segment of our economy as we start this new decade. As a share of the S&P 500, the energy business has declined from 16% at its high point in 2008 to about 4% today. There are many explanations for this deterioration in relative value, and some of them are frankly beyond the control of our industry, but let me concentrate on a few things I believe our business needs to do if we are to succeed and prosper in this challenging environment.","We need to show our investors that we have a path forward to produce reasonable returns for our shareholders on a sustainable long-term basis. This means that as an industry, we have to produce positive cash flow from our operations and use it to benefit our shareholders.","We also have to constantly explain why fossil fuels and particularly natural gas have a long runway of future utilization under even the most bullish scenarios for converting the world's economy to renewable fuels. Reams of research have been published underpinning this position, but it often gets overwhelmed by sloganeering and political noise.","Finally, we have as an industry to do as much as we reasonably can to reduce our emissions, becoming part of the solution, not part of the problem. I\u2019ve outlined on previous calls the success we and others in the midstream segment have had in lowering our methane emissions. And the whole industry needs to move forward on this track and report results in a transparent way.","Now let me apply the financial part of what I\u2019ve just said to Kinder Morgan. Our strategy is in many ways a conservative one, which I think is in keeping with the nature of the industry in which we operate.","Energy infrastructure companies like Kinder Morgan generate lots of cash flow, and the test of good management is how that cash flow is utilized. Since the collapse of oil prices in 2014 and 2015, and its decidedly negative impact on the equity value of the energy segment, including ours, we have prioritized getting our balance sheet in shape, returning to our - dollars to our shareholders through dividends, buying back shares on an opportunistic basis, and pursuing expansion projects when they promise a high and secure IRR. We believe that approach has been the correct one, and we will continue to follow it in the future.","A prime example of our thinking is our gradual increase in the dividends we pay our shareholders. I\u2019ll remind you, we've gone from $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018 to $1 in 2019, and as promised, intend to pay $1.25 for 2020, and all of those dividends have been amply covered by our cash flow. Looking forward, I assure you that we will not be chasing acquisitions or expansion projects that do not meet our strict criteria for delivering solid and transparent returns.","We are helped by having such an extensive system of pipelines and terminals, which allows us to undertake extensions and expansions that benefit our customers and achieve good returns for KMI without taking on the risk inherent in building completely new systems not tied to our present assets.","I can\u2019t promise that we won\u2019t make mistakes, and we certainly will. But I hope you understand that we have a coherent, rational approach to our business that I believe will provide value to our shareholders over the coming years. Steve?","Steven Kean","Thanks, Rich. I\u2019ll cover a few highlights and turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give you the update on our segment performance. And our CFO, David Michels, will take you through the financials, then we\u2019ll take your questions.","The summary on KMI is this, we\u2019re adhering to the principles that we\u2019ve talked about for the last several quarters now and have laid out for you. We have achieved a strong balance sheet, having met and now improved on our approximately 4.5 times debt-to-EBITDA target and with a solid BBB flat rating from all 3 ratings agencies.","We are maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. We are returning value to shareholders with a 25% year-over-year dividend increase and another 25% increase coming in dividends declared in 2020, and we do continue to find attractive growth opportunities.","Again, strong balance sheet, capital discipline, returning value to shareholders and finding additional opportunities across our network at attractive returns. Those are the principles we've been operating by.","And during the third - fourth quarter, with the closing of the sale of Cochin and KML to Pembina and the subsequent sale of the Pembina shares we received as part of the consideration for the transaction, our debt-to-EBITDA stands at 4.3 times. We haven't changed our long-term target of 4.5 times, meaning that in our 2020 plan, we have $1.2 billion of balance sheet capacity.","A few points on the balance sheet flexibility. First, it\u2019s good to have it. We worked hard to get it, having reduced debt by $9.4 billion over the last 4 years or so. And as we said in our guidance in December, having this flexibility is, we believe, valuable to our shareholders, the flexibility itself.","Second, we will be opportunistic in turning that capacity into even greater value for our shareholders. We also have not changed our policy that we announced in mid-2017 when we introduced our share repurchase plan. That policy is that we will be opportunistic on share repurchases, not programmatic, and that message hasn\u2019t changed.","Also, a few points about creating shareholder value with our project investments. First, we do achieve attractive returns on our project investments in aggregate. From 2015 through 2019, we have invested about $12 billion in project capital. That\u2019s to our share and not including CO2 where we have higher return thresholds.","In aggregate, those projects were approved on economics that projected about a 6 times EBITDA multiple. In fact, we're doing slightly better than that already attractive multiple. We'll take you through the details of that at next week\u2019s investor conference.","Second, but also important, are the things that we don\u2019t do or didn\u2019t do, the projects that we did not invest in or proceed with. A few examples, we did not participate in the build-out of gas pipelines in the Mexico interior. We did not proceed with the Northeast Direct gas project in New England back in 2016.","And we sold our Trans Mountain project when it became clear that we couldn\u2019t confidently finish if we started. And we sold it to the one party who had the capability to finish the project. We're happy with all of those decisions and many more.","The point of all this is that we make the right decisions on behalf of our shareholders. We act as principals, not agents. We act like owners, and we protect our owners resources. Again, we\u2019re consistently applying our capital allocation principles, and our performance has demonstrated the value of applying those principles.","A few highlights for the fourth quarter. As mentioned, we closed on the KML and Cochin sale in December and converted the shares we received earlier this month. We placed 3 of the 10 Elba Liquefaction units in service by the end of the year with a fourth unit that went online last week, and we expect to have all 10 in service by midyear. With the first unit going into service in September of last year, we received 80% of our share of project revenues.","Gulf Coast Express went into service in the third quarter of last year. The fourth quarter update is Waha base has almost immediately widened, showing once again the need for an additional pipe. Just to put things in perspective, the spread is about 2 to 3 times the value of the tariff. The capacity is valuable, and frankly we wouldn't mind holding a little ourselves.","On PHP, we have now acquired 99-plus percent of our right of way. This is a significant milestone, given that we are going through the Texas Hill Country. We are well along in the construction of the western spread. We believe that we are close to getting our federal permit so that we can begin construction on the eastern spreads.","As we said on the last call, that process has taken longer than we planned, but we still project today as we did last quarter, an early 2021 in-service date. We believe the agencies involved have been extremely thorough, and the permit will therefore be strong.","Both of our Permian gas pipeline projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipes. Combined, they bring 4 Bcf a day of incremental gas to the Texas Gulf Coast where we have our large intrastate pipeline system.","Those projects bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for that incremental gas through our connectivity with LNG facilities and Texas Gulf Coast power, industrial and pet chem demand.","Our backlog includes about $325 million to expand and improve connectivity along our Texas intrastate pipeline network to enable us to place the incremental volumes that are and will be hitting our system.","We\u2019re still working with customers on a third 2 Bcf a day pipeline called Permian Pass. This remains a work in progress. It\u2019s not in the backlog. We believe, eventually, this pipeline is needed, but probably not as soon as we thought this time last year.","In the meantime, we\u2019re continuing to talk with producers and potential partners and believe, number one, the long-term dynamics of needed gas takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin are strong and that our extensive pipeline network in Texas put us in good position to pick up this opportunity when the market is ready to sign up for it.","These Permian projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation. There\u2019s large supply growth in Texas and large demand growth in Texas. And we can bridge the 2 and connect to our premier Texas intrastate pipeline network and stay entirely within the state of Texas, where we have more commercial flexibility.","As we pointed out at the conference, 70% of natural gas demand growth between now and 2030 is projected to be in Louisiana and Texas, and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that.","Finally, our backlog now stands at $3.6 billion. That\u2019s down from last quarter, primarily due to us placing a processing plant in service during the quarter and removing the backlog associated with KML projects from the KMI backlog. We will remain disciplined here, seeking returns that are comfortably above our cost of capital.","We believe our historical experience, the size of our network and the market dynamics, particularly in natural gas, will continue to provide the opportunity to invest in 2 billion to 3 billion a year. That's what our track record would show.","But if we don't find that much in new opportunities, we are not going to force it, as the examples I gave you show. We have other opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders. We will maintain our discipline.","And with that, I turn it over to Kim.","Kimberly Dang","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Well, I\u2019m going to sound like a broken record because we\u2019re now up to 8 quarters, 8, that\u2019s 2 years in a row in which natural gas transport volumes on our transmission pipes have exceeded the comparable prior year by at least 10%. For the fourth quarter, transport volumes were up 14% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Specifically, EPNG was up almost 1.3 Bcf a day due to increased Permian-related activity and colder California weather. TGP was up over 1 Bcf a day due to expansion projects. CIG was up 780 million cubic feet a day due to increased DJ production and higher heating demand on the front range in Colorado.","KMLP volumes were up 542 million cubic feet a day due to the Sabine Pass Expansion. GCX went into full service, and we are now routinely operating at full capacity of approximately 2 Bcf a day.","And the Texas intrastates were up over 500 million cubic feet a day on continued growth in the Texas Gulf Coast market and the additional supply coming in from GCX.","On our gathering assets and natural gas, volumes were up 8% or 265 million cubic feet a day from the fourth quarter 2018, and that was driven primarily by higher volumes in the Eagle Ford and the Bakken. Our Bakken gathered volumes were up 18%, and our Eagle Ford volumes were up 22%.","Haynesville volumes were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2018. NGL transport volumes were up 23% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2018, and that was due to higher Cochin volumes.","Our product segment was also up nicely in the quarter as we received strong contributions from our Bakken fleet assets, the splitter and SFPP. Overall, refined products volumes were flat in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter 2018, and crude volumes were also essentially flat.","The terminals business was down in this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The liquids business, which accounts for nearly 80% of the segment total, was impacted by the December sale of KML.","But in our Houston liquids terminals, we saw record volumes. We saw record quarterly throughput of 137 million barrels. That's about 1.5 million barrels a day, and we averaged 328,000 barrels a day in refined products going over our docks.","Our boat business was down compared to the fourth quarter 2018, with gains at our - from our petroleum coke handling business more than offset by weakness in coal export volumes.","Finally, CO2 was hurt by lower commodity prices and lower crude volumes. Weighted average NGL price for the quarter was down $5.34 per barrel. That\u2019s about 19% versus the fourth quarter 2018. And our weighted average crude oil price for the quarter was down 10% or $5.67 per barrel.","On the crude oil decline, that was largely driven by our Midland-Cushing base of hedges. Crude oil production in aggregate across all the fields was down 5% compared to the same period in 2018. Net NGL sales volumes were up 4%.","And our CO2 operations, although we\u2019re down this quarter, we still do benefit from holding billions of barrels of original oil in place. And we continue to find additional opportunities to exploit that resource base and extend the productive life of SACROC and Yates in particular, as we have for years. But we will remain disciplined in our investment approach and set higher return thresholds for these investments.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David Michels.","David Michels","All right. Thanks, Kim. So today, we\u2019re declaring a dividend of $0.25 per share, which is in line with our budget to declare $1 per share for the full year 2019. That\u2019s a 25% increase over the $0.80 per share declared for 2018.","KMI's earnings per share this quarter was $0.27 per share, up 29% from the fourth quarter of 2018. And our adjusted earnings per share and DCF per share both grew 4% and 5% respectively from last year's fourth quarter. We generated DCF per share of $0.59, which is 2.4 times or approximately $785 million in excess of the declared dividend.","For the full year 2019, we generated DCF of $2.19 per share, which is $0.01 off of our plan of $2.20. We had projected on the third quarter call that EBITDA and DCF would end the year below plan. EBITDA was less than 3% below plan, and DCF was only slightly below plan.","Since the third quarter, we closed the gap relative to plan due to good commercial and operational performance in the fourth quarter. In fact, DCF ended the year below budget by only $13 million, which is less than a half of 1%.","The main drivers of our performance versus budget include our Elba Island liquefaction facility coming on later than budgeted, lower commodity prices and volumes impacting our CO2 segments, and our FERC 501-G settlement, partially offset by strong Permian supply growth benefiting EPNG more than we had budgeted.","So those are the largest drivers of our EBITDA performance. DCF was impacted by the same items, but also benefited from favorable interest expenses during the year and the add-back of non-cash pension expenses.","So that was performance versus plan for the year. Now onto the details for our fourth quarter versus fourth quarter of 2018. Revenues were down $429 million from the third quarter -- excuse me, from the fourth quarter of 2018. But we also had a decline in the cost of sales in the quarter of $423 million, which nearly offset the revenue decline, meaning that our gross margin was about flat from last quarter of last year.","That's a good reminder that given the way that we contract particularly in our Texas intrastate business, gross margin, which is revenue less cost of sales, is a better indicator than performance than revenue alone.","Additionally, we recognized $112 million of non-cash gains on derivative contracts during the fourth quarter of 2018. We treat those non-cash gains, which don't - on those derivative contracts that didn't settle in the period as certain items, and we exclude those from our non-GAAP metrics. But for those non-cash gains, therefore, gross margin was up over $100 million period-over-period.","You\u2019ll see on the income statement, the gain\/loss on divestitures and impairments line item. That includes for the fourth quarter of 2019 a $1.3 billion gain related to our KML and U.S. Cochin pipeline sales, partially offset by $364 million of asset impairments on our gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma and Northern Texas, driven by reduced drilling activity and on our Tall Cotton asset and our CO2 segment driven by reduced investment expectations.","The loss, earnings from investments - excuse me, from equity investments line item includes, for the fourth quarter 2019, a $650 million impairment on our Ruby pipeline investment, which we took in the quarter as a result of upcoming contract expirations along with competing natural gas supplies.","Net income available to common stockholders was up $127 million or 26% versus Q4 of 2018 due in part to the KML Cochin gain in the quarter. Net income available to common stockholders adjusted for certain items, or what we call adjusted earnings, were up $24 million or 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.26 for the quarter, up $0.01 or 4% from the prior quarter.","Moving on to our DCF performance. Natural gas was up $120 million or 11%. We saw greater performance from last year due mostly to expansion projects. The Elba's trial and liquefaction facilities contributing with 3 units in service last year, Gulf Coast Express was placed fully into service, and TGP had multiple - contributions from multiple expansion projects.","Kim covered the main drivers of the other segments for the quarter. Now moving to G&A and corporate charges, those were higher by $34 million due to lower overhead capitalized projects and higher non-cash pension expenses. So those are the main changes in adjusted EBITDA, which was $58 million or 3% above Q4 2018.","Interest expense was $18 million lower driven by our lower debt balance and lower LIBOR rates benefiting our floating interest rate swaps. And that was partially offset by interest income that we recognized during the fourth quarter of 2018 due to sale proceeds we had on hand from the Trans Mountain sale.","Sustaining capital was $30 million higher versus the fourth quarter of 2018. However, we had budgeted to spend more sustaining capital in 2019, and we actually ended the year favorable to plan in the sustaining capital category. Total DCF of $1,354,000,000 is up $81 million or 6%, and our DCF per share of $0.59 was up $0.03 or 5%.","Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter at 4.3 times debt to EBITDA, which was a nice improvement from the 4.7 times at the end of the third quarter of 2019 and from the 4.5 times at the beginning of 2019. It\u2019s also better than our budget of 4.5 despite EBITDA coming in a bit below budget.","We remain focused on capital discipline, which means we continue to only invest in projects that meet our high hurdle rates, and we continuously review our capital plan. In 2019, those efforts resulted in more than $300 million of lower capital spend compared to what we had budgeted.","Looking at the net debt, our adjusted net debt ended the quarter at $33 billion, which is down $2.2 billion from the third quarter and $1.1 billion lower than year-end 2018. We didn't issue any KMI bonds in 2019. And in fact, the last KMI bond issuance was nearly 2 years ago in February 2018.","Additionally as Steve mentioned, but I think is worth mentioning again, our net debt is down $9.4 billion since the third quarter of 2015, so nice progress there.","To reconcile the change in net debt for the quarter, we had DCF of $1.354 billion. We had $1.55 billion of proceeds from the Cochin sale. We sold our share of KML's preferred equity, $215 million of which was in our net debt. We contributed $600 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures.","We paid dividends of $570 million and we had a $250 million working capital source of cash, which is mainly interest expense accruals. And that reconciles you approximately to the $2.2 billion decrease in debt for the quarter.","For the full year reconciliation to the $1.12 billion of lower debt, we had DCF of $4.993 billion. We had $1.67 billion of divestitures, mostly represented by the U.S. Cochin sale. We removed the $215 million of KML's preferred equity.","We had growth CapEx and JV contributions of $2.92 billion. We paid dividends of $2.2 billion. Paid taxes on the Trans Mountain sale of $340 million, and we had approximately a $300 million working capital use of cash. And that gets you to the main pieces of the $1.12 billion decrease in net debt for the year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Steven Kean","All right. So a couple of quick reminders before we start the questions. Number one is, as I'm sure many of you know, we will have our investor - Annual Investor Conference next week. And so David and Kim and I and others will be going through the details of 2020. So we'll kind of ask you to wait for that more detailed presentation in terms of the 2020 plans. [Operator Instructions]","All right. Denise, with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question does come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll keep my questions light given the Analyst Day next week. Maybe to start off, Steve, you\u2019ve been very careful to say no programmatic buybacks in the past and you\u2019ve reiterated it today, and you just want to use it with respect to opportunistic buybacks.","Is there a plan, to either share with us today or at the Analyst Day next week, if you plan to complete the authorization by a certain point in time? Just a little bit more color with respect to how you\u2019re thinking about buyback over a longer term basis?","Steven Kean","Not really. I mean the guidance that we're giving is very consistent with what it\u2019s been all along, which is we evaluate these decisions based on return. We do look to purchase opportunistically and not programmatically. We\u2019ve never published any kind of target price, et cetera. And so you put that together, and you say we\u2019re not going to announce a specific timing for the conclusion of the program either.","But we have used about $525 million of the $2 billion program. We have used it opportunistically, and we are pleased with the results of our share repurchases under the program to date.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe as a follow-up, I was just wondering if you can expand a little bit on the changes in the backlog that you put out in your prepared remarks. Has Elba already been removed from it, with it coming online? And were there any changes to your CO2 outlook with respect to the backlog or everything is kind of...","Steven Kean","Yeah. So Elba, what we\u2019ve been doing on Elba is since we've put the first unit in service, and that's really - I mean that's really when the balance of the plant was complete and when the substantial 80% to our share of the revenues started, we started reflecting Elba at - pulling it off the backlog as the units were coming on. Correct, yes?","Kimberly Dang","Yes.","Steven Kean","Okay. And then we have also put in service in our natural gas group as I mentioned, a processing plant in the Bakken area, which - that went into service. And so then that came off the backlog. And that's really the biggest chunk in that movement.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeremy Tonet","Good afternoon. Just wanted to start off with a question with M&A, actually, and it seems like Kinder could be in a position to do different things right here. We saw earlier this week, Magellan announced terminal sales at a valuation that appears to be quite robust, given where a lot of things trade today. And just wondering how you guys think about kind of portfolio optimization within that context, given the private equity bid there.","On the other side, it seems like growth is slowing in certain parts of midstream, and maybe there's the potential to kind of roll up other players out there. And I know Kinder has been successful at rolling things up in the past. Just wondering how you think about those two different angles, and if anything could make sense for you guys going forward?","Steven Kean","Well as Rich said at the start, our approach to our business and to this industry is conservative. And so we spent a lot of time and did a lot of work to get our balance sheet in the shape that it\u2019s in. And we\u2019re really not interested in hurting our leverage metrics through M&A or through anything else for that matter.","Look, we\u2019ve always looked around at opportunities, and we would continue to do so. But they would need to meet pretty substantial return criteria, similar to what other uses of capital would be. And so that kind of narrows that opportunity unless something really valuable comes along.","You mentioned the recent announcement on asset purchase and sale between midstream operators. We did close a very small acquisition of a pipeline in South Texas. That was a very nice fit into our Texas intrastate system. And we certainly - and we did that at attractive terms on an attractive return for that capital invested, and so we\u2019ll keep our eyes open for things like that.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. And just as far as the prices that you see out there, I mean is that something that you pursue, just given how it was so higher than where a lot of guys trade right now or on the sale side?","Steven Kean","Well, you mentioned the private equity bid that's out there. And that's a phenomenon that certainly we\u2019ve observed as well, which means there's competition for those things. And really, Jeremy, I think it comes back to we\u2019re just going to be very judicious with our shareholders money here. And we\u2019re going to do things that we can do that we are very, very confident are going to produce value for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Spiro Dounis","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just start with the project backlog. Steve, I appreciate your comments around capital discipline. I think that should be pretty welcomed by the market. But I just want to look to the backlog, it\u2019s about 1.5 years of growth here going forward. And so just curious how we should think about how and when you start to replenish that backlog, and when you'll be in a position to sanction more projects outside of Permian Pass?","Steven Kean","Yes. Sure. And actually it's something I should have said in response to Shneur's comment is as I said in talking about the backlog, there was also to KM's share, about 55 million or so of KML backlog that came out as well. So that, in addition to the processing plant, was the other explanation for the change quarter-to-quarter.","Look, we don\u2019t approach capital investments with the idea of replenishing a backlog. And so the information or the guidance that we can give you is if you look at over a very long period of time, 10 years plus, and you look at what we've been able to find on our network, it's been between $2 billion and $3 billion. And we'll show you this, it's in Kim's presentation, the detail on this. It's been between 2 and 3, and the mean has been 2.5.","Next year, we've got 2.4 in, in the budget that we announced in December. We'll keep looking for those opportunities and find them as they - what we've seen, what we've experienced is that the opportunity to do those investments at attractive returns are the opportunities that really are along our network as it stands right now.","And we've got a very vast network, and I think we'll continue to find opportunities there, but they'll be up and down. They could be in the low 2s, or they could be like they were in this past year, around 3.","But we don't aim to replenish the backlog. We follow kind of what we see coming down the pike, including things like Permian Pass. And that's what gives us some confidence that our kind of 2 to 3 historical is probably still in the ballpark for us over the next little while.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. That's fair. I appreciate that. Second question, just around ESG. You guys have been leaders here in midstream, and it looks like you're getting credit for that. And so I guess, one point to me what some large investors have come out and said, in the last 2 weeks, aiming to really sharpen their focus on ESG and screening investments in that manner.","So just curious how much ESG really drives your decision-making on an asset-by-asset basis? Would you ever consider selling something or buying something in order to fill in the ESG standard?","And specifically, I\u2019m thinking about is something like your coal terminals, right? If you felt like that could be harmful to your ESG brand, would that be something you would consider selling?","Steven Kean","Yes. So part of the ESG is G, which is governance, which is taking care of your shareholders and doing the right things with their money. And so we have not looked at it from the perspective of investment. We\u2019re very, very weighted to natural gas, and that's a good business for us, and it's a big part of the solution going forward as Rich mentioned.","But I do want to acknowledge what you said, we have tried to be leaders in this. And we've done, I think, a very good job across our business units, our operations. This isn't just some corporate thing. This is something that is permeated through our operations. And we have earned the number two ranking in our sector for how we manage ESG risk. Now that job is not done. We have to keep going. But we do things, for example, like look at scenarios of continued methane emissions reductions and we've really overachieved the target there, if you will. There's not really such a thing as overachieving it.","But I mean we had a target in the one future group, which is a 1% limit across the entire chain from production through distribution. And the transmission and storage sector's allocation of that 1% is 0.31%, and we're at 0.02%.","And so we've really done a very good job there. And that's good operational blocking and tackling. And by the way, that's in our shareholders' best interest, too, because we get paid to move methane, not to lose it. So that\u2019s been a multi-decade process. And that's an example of how we incorporate it into the way we do business and the way we think of things.","But we're not going to go out and do a dilutive renewable acquisition, nor are we going to do an economic divestiture from our investors' standpoint. We're keeping an eye on the G as well as the E and S.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tristan Richardson","Good morning \u2013 good afternoon, guys. Just a project question on Permian Highway, just a clarification. Can you talk about the expected timing of permitting on the federal side that you mentioned would allow the eastern spread to kick off?","Steven Kean","Make it a point of not speaking for federal regulators. So all I can say is based on how fully the record is developed, and based on certain statutory timelines that are built in to the authorizing legislation, we expect it to be soon. And that's why I used the word soon and not a more specific one.","Tristan Richardson","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just has the commercial discussion around Permian Pass changed now that the market in the world has seen how short-lived that narrow spread was?","Steven Kean","Certainly everybody's noticed that, I think. I would say that we first saw, as we reported when we came out in the third quarter, we saw - I would tie it to - after the producers came out with their second quarter guidance, which was after we did our second quarter, and they tightened up on their capital plans, et cetera, that there was definitely a cooling of what had been some fairly active commercial discussions that we thought might have even led us to an FID decision last year.","And that clearly has been delayed. I don't think it's cooled any further than - since then. And I think people do recognize that gas - additional gas takeaway is going to be needed.","And something that I thought was interesting that one of the fundamentals guys wrote about is in a Permian, 97% of the value in the well is in the oil and the liquids that are produced. And oil prices are still pretty good.","And the Permian has been completely debottlenecked to the point where Midland is trading above WTI. So that suggest, if you can economically produce oil, you're going to need to find a way to put the gas away. And we already have a constrained or a high basis differential between Waha and ship.","And so I think as people start to evaluate their capital plans and think about what's economic to do and not, that they\u2019re going to ultimately need some additional takeaway capacity. We can't guarantee that we're going to get it, but we think we're well placed for it.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Stanley your line is open - from Wolfe Research.","Keith Stanley","Hi, thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the M&A topic. The last call, you guys had cited some inbound interest at attractive multiples on some assets. Just curious if you're still getting interest in specific assets and level of optimism you can execute on accretive sales this year?","Steven Kean","Yes. So this kind of came up in Jeremy's question where he pointed to the high PE bid. And what I would say is that there is a differential between how private equity investors, the multiple of which private equity investors place on the cash flows through certain assets that we generate and what it appears the public markets place. And you can see that in evidence of what the multiple was on Cochin You can see you it on what the multiple was on Utopia. That's out there for sure.","But like these other things, I think what you're hearing as a theme for us is we are going to be careful and conservative. We're going to want to make sure that those numbers really work for us.","And so, Keith, we're not giving any guidance and really can't practically give you any guidance on something being monetized this year or at any particular time period.","Keith Stanley","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys congrats on a good quarter. Real quick question. Just curious, over the last 30 to 60 days, how your conversations with producer customers have been, given how weak natural gas prices especially over the last couple of weeks have been? And how you think about how that flows through both your gathering business, but even some of the long-haul pipes, that have significant producer counterparties instead of regulated utility counterparties? Thinking like Ruby, obviously, given the impairment, but even some of the smaller ones like Fayetteville Express or MEP?","Steven Kean","Okay. So a lot in there, but I think there are two things. One is the conversation is fundamentally different with an oil producer who is also producing natural gas, like the people in the Permian for example, right? And so that's where a lot of that incremental growth in gas production that we expect, we've seen this.","Others have seen it a shift in where the growth is going to come from away from kind of some of the dry gas plays and more toward the associated gas plays, like what you see in the Permian and the Bakken.","On the other hand, I mean there's no doubt that with gas prices where they are. The dry gas producers are under some strain, and they're being very careful and thoughtful about how they are managing their business, and those folks are our customers, and we're in good contact with them. And it's not -- those are not discussions about growth.","Well, some of them are, but they're more discussions about making sure that we continue to have adequate credit support and that we're being constructive where we can be, et cetera.","But the dry gas plays are more challenged and the associated gas that's coming out of the Bakken. I mean I think the next solution in the Bakken really needs to be incremental residue gas takeaway capacity out of there, and we already talked about the Permian. So no more there.","Now on the other assets that you mentioned, specifically, we talked a little bit about Ruby. That's a challenged asset, challenged for the reasons we -- well, it's coming from the Rockies. Rockies is overpiped in terms of an export capacity basis.","That's been the case for a while now, and there are alternative sources from Canada, for example, to serve the market in the northwest. So that's just - that's a challenged asset and FEP is challenged as well.","But MEP, it's been a little bit of ups and downs, but we're seeing nice positive spreads that we're able to transact at. That's a little bit more of a - there's a multi-zonal system. It gives us access to a lot more supply and delivery interconnects and takeaways. So that asset has improved - improved some from the prospects that we had.","No doubt, contracts that roll off there and that rolled off last year rolled out into a much more challenged spread environment, but there's still positive economic value on that asset. And so those are - that's kind of the rundown on those three.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Just one quick follow-up, any update on the JV you had talked about with Tallgrass, kind of in the Rockies and that neck of the woods with multiple assets involved. It's been a little quiet on that front.","Steven Kean","Yes. We really haven't been able to make anything work there in terms of - we did an open season to secure some contracting - to recontract some expiring capacity on HH, which will go through Pony Express on its way to Cushing.","We weren't able to do any other conversion, upstream or other expansion related projects. But we do still have pipe in the ground in the west that we are looking at alternatives on and continue to look at alternatives there.","Operator","The next question comes from Ujjwal Pradhan with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ujjwal Pradhan","Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. First one, I wanted to touch briefly on your LNG exports market outlook. I think some global forecasts out there seem to paint a picture of the U.S. led LNG supply growth overwhelming global demand growth over the next couple of years. How concerned are you about risks to your overall nat gas supply to LNG export facilities in the U.S.?","Steven Kean","We\u2019re very happy with the LNG customers that we have, and I think the facilities that are coming out of the ground are coming online. And the way our contract structures work is we're getting paid for the capacity whether it's used or not. But they are using it.","And so we're not - we're not exposed to and the way we structured everything, even on Elba, our contractual structure on Elba, is our contractual structure is such that we are not exposed to the vagaries of global commodity prices in natural gas.","So I think we - obviously, we're interested in seeing additional LNG infrastructure get built and we'd like to be the ones to serve it. We're - depending on the day, 40% to 50% of the throughput that goes through to LNG exports. And that's been a nice growth story for us, and we'd like to see that continue to grow, but we're not exposed to, again, not exposed to the global LNG price because of the way our contracts are structured.","Ujjwal Pradhan","Got it. And maybe a quick follow-up on the M&A discussion earlier. If you were to able to do sizable asset sales this year, what would be the priority for the use of those proceeds?","Steven Kean","Again, we make those - we've gotten to a milestone, obviously, on the balance sheet as we pointed out. And the way we've looked at uses of cash is further debt reduction, share repurchases, dividends or projects. And we make those determinations based on what we expect the returns to be from them. And that mostly comes down to after you've secured your balance sheet, you've secured your dividend, and we're meeting as we - what we projected in 2017.","Then you look at the trade-off between a share repurchase and a project, and you make adjustments for the different nature of those two assets or those two investments. And you do the best return opportunity - risk-adjusted return opportunity that you face. So the same order of operations we've talked about before.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time.","Richard Kinder","Okay. Thank you very much for sharing part of your day with us. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference call. We appreciate your participation, and you may disconnect at this time."],"12586":["Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 17, 2019  4:30 PM ET","Company Participants","Rich Kinder - Executive Chairman","Steve Kean - CEO","Kim Dang - President","David Michels - VP & CFO","Dax Sanders - EVP & CSO","John Schlosser - President, Terminals","Tom Martin - President, Natural Gas Pipelines","Conference Call Participants","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Tristan Richardson - SunTrust","Gabriel Moreen - Mizuho Securities","Spiro Dounis - Credit Suisse","Keith Stanley - Wolfe Research","Dennis Coleman - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Mirek Zak - Citigroup","Jeremy Tonet - JPMorgan","Operator","Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Jennifer.","Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call includes forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measure set forth at the end of KMI's and KML's earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions, for a list of important material assumptions, expectations, and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","As usual before turning the call over to Steve, Kim, and the rest of the team, I'd like to provide a quick update and some insight on our financial philosophy of Kinder Morgan. The important news today is that our Board has increased the dividend by 25% from $0.20 per quarter or $0.80 annualized to $0.25 per quarter or a $1 annualized. Now this is consistent with our attention which we announced in mid-2017 to increase the dividend to $0.80 in 2018 to $1 in 2019 and to $1.25 in 2020. Central to our ability to do this is the strong and growing cash flow, our assets are generating and you will see that again in the first quarter's results.","We had used that cash to get our balance sheet in shape having paid off over $8 billion of debt and receive credit upgrade from both S&P and Moody's and we intend to maintain our improved credit metrics. Beyond that we are now focusing on using our cash to fund our expansion CapEx without need to access the equity market to pay our increasing dividends and to repurchase stock when appropriate.","In short, we believe, we are being careful and conservative stewards of our cash flow and using it in ways that benefit all our shareholders. You should expect no less of us should be reassured by the fact that the management and board of KMI are significant shareholders. Steve?","Steve Kean","Yes, thanks Rich.","We'll be updating you on both KMI and KML assessment. I'm going to start with a high-level update and an outlook on KMI and then turn over to our President Kim Dang to give any update on our segment performance, David Michels, KMI's CFO will take through the numbers, Dax Sanders will update you on KML, and then we'll take your questions on both companies.","The summary on KMI is this, we're adhering to the principles that we've previously laid out for you. We have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4.5X target of debt-to-EBITDA and with ratings upgrades from both Moody's and S&P; we're maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self funding our investments. We are returning value to shareholders with the 25% dividend increase announced today and we continue to find attractive growth opportunities with a net add of $400 million to our backlog during the quarter.","Again strong balance sheet, capital discipline, returning value to our shareholders, and finding additional growth opportunities. Those are the principles we operate by.","Here are a few updates on some of the key projects. First, our Permian Natural Gas Pipeline project. Our customers are anxious to have us get their gas out of the Permian, so they can also get their oil and NGLs out. We have two projects to get the gas out. Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway each are about 2 Bcf a day of capacity. Both are secured by long-term contracts and both are in execution stage. GCX is scheduled to be in service in October of this year with Permian Highway following a year later. Both projects are on schedule. Both projects are at attractive returns which we expect to realize and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipeline.","Combine they bring 4 Bcf a day of incremental gas to a system that moves about 5 Bcf a day today. Those projects will bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for that incremental gas through our connectivity with LNG facilities, Mexico exports, utility demand, and Texas Gulf Coast industrial and Pet Chem demand.","Our execution and our economics of these projects both look good and we're actively managing our risks and opportunities on both. These projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation that is this, there is a large supply growth in Texas and a large demand growth in Texas and we can bridge the two and connect to our premier Texas Intrastate Pipeline Network and stay entirely within the State of Texas which facilitates permitting and commercial flexibility.","As we pointed out at the conference in January of this year, 70% of the demand growth between now and 2030 is projected to be in Louisiana and Texas largely due to LNG and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that.","Also it's worth noting that now 70% of our backlog is natural gas and 56% of that is in our Midstream growth where market based rates in terms of service prevail.","On another key project, Elba our LNG facility that we're building in Savannah, Georgia, we are closing in on the in-service date for the first unit. We now expect in-service of that unit to be around May 1, a couple of weeks from now. Getting the first unit on secures about 70% of the project revenue. That way we've experienced is certainly unwelcome but the risk allocation between us, our contractor, and our customer provides significant protection and mitigates the effect to our IRR. So we're introducing natural gas into the facility as well as refrigerants and that process has been doing well.","Also of note, we added a net $400 million to the backlog this quarter with new investments in natural gas and terminals primarily more than offsetting projects placed in service. The backlog now stands at $6.1 billion.","A few observations about our expansion capital investments over time. As several people have asked how we're doing on the capital, we deploy in those projects. So at the January conference Kim took you through our historical project performance. If you look at Page 49 of what we provided there you'll see a comparison between project EBITDA multiples and actual performance for the projects completed during the 2015 to 2018 period. You'll see that our actual performance was better than our original estimate 5.8X versus 6.1X in the original estimate. You also see that the story is even better in natural gas which makes up the bulk of our backlog as I said when we came out 5.2X versus the original estimate of 5.8X.","On Page 50, you also see some other factors that partially offset the contribution from our project investments. But overall project performance is very good. The point here is we're very careful with your capital; we don't swing at every pitch. We definitely have our hits and misses but we have shown that in aggregate we do well. We get there by having elevated return criteria well above our cost of capital. We focused on projects that we understand and primarily focus on expansions off of our existing footprint. All of this helps us invest the returns that are well above our cost of capital and helps overcome the inevitable curveballs that come up during project execution. This has served us well particularly during an increasingly challenging regulatory environment.","Next an update on 501-G. As we said in our press release Monday of last week we have reached settlements on two more systems EPNG and TGP which now resolves a vast majority of our 501-G exposure. This is an overhang that we now believe we have nearly entirely behind us. The settlements are pending at the commission right now. Here is our observations: the commission generally approves a negotiated settlement that are pending before the commission but we expect that they will be approved; and two, they respect existing settlements including rate moratoria that are in place.","The 501-G overhang has been a consistent part of the dialogue around our stock and we are pleased with our resolution of it. I believe we've said this before but when we announced the budget we did not have anything in for settling 501-G matters but we telegraphed that if we did get such settlements it would likely be a good thing for the value of the company. And we're happy with the outcome.","Finally, before turning it over to Kim, word about the KML process. As we say in the release the process is ongoing. We don't have anything more than that to say at this point. And as you'll hear when we get to KML we've been attentive not only to the process but also to managing and developing the existing business. It's comprised of a very good set of midstream assets. It gets a good deal of effort and focus from our management team. But what I want to say from a KMI investor standpoint is that you need to keep in mind that while our process gets a lot of attention KML makes up about 2% of KMI EBITDA on a consolidated basis so just to put it in perspective for KMI.","And with that, I'll turn over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Thanks, Steve.","So looking at the segments Natural Gas had another outstanding quarter it was up 12%. If you look at the market fundamentals they remain very strong for 2019 Lower 48 natural gas demand is expected to increase by 5.5 Bcf to approximately 95 Bcf a day and the Lower 48 production is expected to increase by 7.5 Bcf a day. Growth in the Natural Gas markets in the first quarter is driving very nice results on large diameter pipes.","Transport volumes on our transmission pipe increased approximately 4.55 Bcf a day or 14%. This is the fifth quarter in a row in which volumes have exceeded the comparable prior period by 10% or more. If you look on the demand side deliveries to LNG facilities off of our pipes, I'll put almost 1.5 Bcf a day in the quarter, that's an increase of approximately 900 million cubic feet a day versus the first quarter of 2018.","Power demand on our system for the quarter was down slightly primarily due to warmer weather. Exports to Mexico were up 183 million cubic feet to 3.2 Bcf a day which is a 6% increase versus the first quarter of 2018.","On the supply side, production out of the key basins we continue that we serve continues to increase. You look at the Permian Natural Gas wellhead volumes increased approximately 30% and the Bakken Natural Gas wellhead volumes increased about 31% percent and the Haynesville they increased 29% and in Eagle Ford they increased 8%.","If you look at where these volumes showed up on our transmission pipes, EPNG volumes were up 1.1 Bcf a day primarily due to Permian volumes. Rig volumes were up 900 million cubic feet a day and CIG volumes were up approximately 550 a day both due to growth in the DJ Basin.","KML -- KMLA volumes were up 570 million cubic feet a day primarily due to LNG exports.","On our gas gathering assets, volumes were up 21% or 570 million cubic feet a day driven by the production increases that I mentioned in the Haynesville and the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.","Overall, the higher utilization on our systems a lot of which came without the need to spend significant capital resulted in nice bottom-line growth in the quarter and longer-term as our systems go up will drive nice expansion opportunity.","If you look at the longer-term by 2024 the Natural Gas market is projected to grow to almost 110 Bcf a day driven by increases in power generation, LNG, and Mexico Exports and continued industrial development with most of that supply growth expected to come out of the Permian, the Haynesville, and the Marcellus.","On the product segment it was down slightly in the quarter. We had increased contributions from our Southeast refined products assets, Calnev, and our Bakken crude assets that were more than offset by lower contributions from KMCC. Volumes on KMCC were actually up 16% in the quarter but that was more than offset by lower rates.","Overall crude and condensate volumes were up 8%, refined product volumes in the quarter were flat.","From the terminals business it was up modestly in the quarter. The liquids business which accounts for about 80% of the segment was driven by strength in the Houston ship channel and on our baseline terminal expansion project in Edmonton. These increases were slightly offset by the increased lease expense at our Edmonton South terminal and that became a third-party obligation post the Trans Mountain sale. We added 1.4 million barrels of tankage versus the first quarter of 2018 due to the baseline project coming online bringing our total leasable capacity to almost 92 million barrels as the bulk business in our Terminal segment was roughly flat.","Our CO2 segment was down in the quarter and that was primarily due to lower crude and NGL prices but also to slightly lower production -- oil production volumes. Our net realized crude oil price was down about $11 per barrel and NGL prices were down about $4 per barrel. That crude oil production was down approximately 1,200 barrels a day or 3% due to lower production at Katz and Goldsmith. Katz and Goldsmith are two of our smaller fields and accounts for roughly 10% of our overall production. In these fields since we are not implementing new development projects, we would expect to continue decline over time. On the other hand at SACROC which is our largest field and accounts for well over 60% of our production we continue to find attractive projects.","The CO2 sales and transport business went up slightly in the quarter due to about 5% higher CO2 volumes, CO2 prices were essentially flat. That's it for the segment overview and I'll turn it over to David.","David Michels","Thanks, Kim.","So today we're declaring a dividend of $0.25 per share, up from $0.20 per share last quarter and in line with our budget to declare $1 per share for the full year 2019. As Rich mentioned, this would be a 25% increase over $0.80 per share compared to 2018. KMI had a good quarter. We grew significantly from last year's first quarter and we overcame a number of items to end the quarter in line with our budget.","We generated DCF per share of $0.60 which is 2.4 times our declared dividend or over $800 million in excess of that dividend. Additionally as the press release points out for the full-year 2019, we forecast our DCF to be on budget and that is even after incorporating the approximately $50 million impacts from our announced FERC 501-G settlement so very nice overall performance from our underlying business.","Turning to the earnings page. Revenues were in line with the first quarter 2018 but operating income was higher due to lower quarter-over-quarter costs.","Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter was $556 million which is a 15% increase from the first quarter of last year. That includes the benefit of zero preferred dividend payments down from $39 million we paid last year in the quarter as a result of the conversion of our preferred equity securities in October of last year.","Adjusted earnings per share was up it was 25% up $0.03 or 14% from the prior period, very nice growth there.","Moving on to distributable cash flow. We believe distributable cash flow is a good reflection of our cash earnings and it was up it was $0.60 per share for the quarter up $0.04 or 7% from Q1 of 2018. Natural Gas segment was the largest driver of that growth up $127 million or 12%.","As has been the consistent theme for that segment recently we benefited on multiple fronts. TGP benefited from multiple expansion projects placed in service in 2018. EPNG was up driven by Permian supply growth more than offsetting the unfavorable impact from the FERC 501-G settlement in the quarter.","Texas and Louisiana gathering and processing assets were up driven by increased volumes from the Haynesville and Eagle Ford Basin. Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline was up due to the Sabine Pass expansion.","Our product segment was down $4 million, our terminals segment was up $2 million, our CO2 segment was down $48 million or 20%, as Kim covered the drivers behind those segments performance for the quarter.","Kinder Morgan Canada was down $46 million from Q1 2018 as a result of the sale of our Trans Mountain assets.","Our G&A expense was lower by $6 million due to greater amounts of costs capitalized to growth projects as well as lower G&A resulting from the transition zone sale. Those items were partially offset by higher pension expenses in the quarter and those pension expenses are non-cash and are backed out of our DCF metric and replaced with actual cash contribution. Excluding the higher pension costs, G&A would have been $16 million lower than Q1 2018.","Interest expense was $14 million lower driven by lower debt balance and lower average rate on our bonds as well as greater interest capitalized to our growth projects. That was partially offset by higher LIBOR rates which impacted the interest rate swaps which settled in the quarter.","Preferred stock dividends were down $39 million as I mentioned before. So total DCF of $1.371 billion, was up $124 million or 10% from the prior period.","And to summarize the main changes greater segment EBDA of $38 million when you include the NCI change which relates to the segment generated from greater natural gas contributions offset by lower contributions from CO2 in Canada. $14 million lower interest expense, $16 million lower G&A expenses excluding the non-cash pension expense, and $39 million lower preferred stock dividend which gets you to $107 million of the $124 million increase in the quarter.","DCF per share of $0.60 was again up $0.04 to 7% with the same drivers as total DCF but inclusive of the incremental shares issued as a result of the preferred stock conversion.","Moving onto the balance sheet, once again we have two net debt-to-EBITDA figures listed at the bottom of the table. At year-end 2018 KMI's balance in our adjusted net debt figure included all of the KML's Trans Zone sales proceeds and the adjusted net debt figure excludes the portion of those proceeds that was paid to the KML public shareholders in early January.","Beyond year-end 2018 there was no difference between the net debt and adjusted net debt figures. At the end of the quarter at 4.6% times debt-to-EBITDA which is consistent with our budget is slightly higher than year-end 4.5 times.","Our end of year 2019 leverage is currently forecasted to be 4.6 times which is slightly unfavorable to our plan of 4.5 but is consistent with our long-term leverage target of approximately 4.5 times but slightly higher than budget year-end leverages due to slightly lower than planned EBITDA. The reason EBITDA is forecast to be slightly below budget but while DCF is expected to be on budget it's because of the add-back non-cash pension expenses, the low EBITDA, and EBITDA does not take up the benefit of our favorable interest expense.","Some items to note on the balance sheet changes from year-end. Our cash reduction of $3.1 billion due to -- $1.3 billion used to pay down KMI bonds maturing in the quarter, $800 million distribution to public KML shareholders, $340 million of Canadian taxes due to the Trans Mountain sale, and almost $300 million of lower revolver and CP borrowings. In other assets $700 million of the $712 million increase is due to booking a right to use assets resulting from a new lease accounting standard. The offsetting liabilities in short-term and long-term liabilities include $647 million which are in long-term liabilities which explains most of the increase of the $618 million in other liabilities.","In our short-term and long-term debt changes, in short-term that was mainly due to the payoff of the $1.3 billion of bonds and $700 million of other bonds which rolled into the short-term category and out of the long-term category.","Our adjusted net debt ended the quarter at $34.8 billion which is an increase of $668 million from year-end and to reconcile that we generated $1.371 billion in DCF. We spent approximately $750 million in growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. We paid approximately $450 million of dividends; we paid $340 million of taxes on our Trans Mountain sale, and we had a working capital use of cash of approximately $500 million. The largest items in that are greater interest payments in the quarter, bonus payments, payroll and property tax payments.","With that I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Now we're going to turn to KML and that KML again we realized burning question here is the process we previously announced and which is we said today remains ongoing and we should have an update for you in the coming weeks. All we have to say at this point about the process is in the press release but clearly we'll have more to say once we have something to announce.","In the meantime as you'll hear from Dax and as we've said all along we've got a good business here that we continue to operate and invest in as a standalone business. And we're in the good position of not being forced to do anything. So we'll work through the process and we'll have we believe a conclusion in the coming weeks much to know more about it at that time.","With that, I will turn over to Dax.","Dax Sanders","Thanks, Steve.","Before I get into the results, I do want to update you on a couple of general business items. On the announced diesel export project, we received our required air permit amendment and key building permit to satisfy the key condition process that customer's contract. As such we can now commence construction activities planned to do so in May. Consistent with previous statements this is an approximately $43 million project that contemplates two new desolate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200,000 barrels underpinned by a 20-year take or pay contract that we expect to put in service during the first half of 2021.","Of the shed six reactivation project that we discussed we expect to get our key building permit shortly which will allow us to start construction in May also and have the project in-service in December 2019. As a reminder the total CapEx on that project is approximately $8 million.","Now moving towards the results and of note as I talk through the results I'm generally only going to reference results from continuing operations as discontinued ops only relates to prior periods and is less relevant.","Today the KML board declared a dividend for the first quarter of 0.1625 per restricted voting share or $0.65 annualized which is consistent with previous guidance. Earnings per restricted voting share for continuing operations for the first quarter of 2019 are $0.12 and that is derived from approximately $21 million of income from continuing operations which is up approximately $7 million versus the same quarter in 2018.","Revenue increased across most all of KMLs assets and was led by the contribution from the baseline tank and terminal assets coming online but was partially offset by the expiration of a third-party contract on ESRP which we've previously discussed. The increase in revenue was partially offset by higher G&A and depreciation.","Total DCF from continuing operations for the quarter was $22.4 million which is down about a $1 million from the comparable period in 2018. That reflects coverage of approximately $1 million and reflects the DCF payout ratio of approximately 85%. The coverage and payout ratio this quarter were skewed by the large cash tax amount of almost $21 million which is $14 million higher than the almost $7 million in comparable period last year. As we previously discussed, we were not required to make cash tax payments in 2018 or 2018 operations but rather were able to defer them to this year. As such, we made a cash tax payment in the first quarter of $17.3 million for 2018 which is consistent with what we budgeted and a payment of $3.5 million for 2019 which together make up the almost $21 million.","As we sit here today while we have not finalized the 2018 Canadian return, we believe the tax ultimately owed will be less than the $17.3 million that we budgeted and paid and that we'll be able to apply the excess to 2019.","Looking at the other components of the DCF variance, segment EBITDA before certain items up $13 million compared to Q1 2018 with the Terminals segment up $9 million and the pipeline segment up $4 million. The Terminals segment was higher due primarily to baseline coming online which accounted for about $7.3 million. The North 40 added about $2.2 million largely from rate increases in new TSAs and Vancouver Works added about $1.7 million due to incremental volumes. Those positives were offset by $2.4 million negative variance on ESRP primarily due to the expiration of the contract that I mentioned a second ago.","Pipeline segment was higher primarily due to lower O&M on coaching of approximately $2.7 million due to the non-occurrence of inline inspection, dig, and other integrity management items performed in Q1 2018 and higher revenues of approximately $1.3 million largely from FX and a short-term deal not in place in Q1 2018.","D&A is negative about 1.5 million compared to Q1 2018 largely due to some transition services costs related to the Trans Mountain sale and some higher labor.","Interest is favorable by approximately $1.6 million due primarily to interest income on the $308 million of cash we held until making the cash tax payment of the same amount on the Trans Mountain gain on February 28.","I've already discussed cash taxes, preferred dividends are flat, and sustaining capital was slightly unfavorable compared to Q1 2018 due to timing.","With that, I'll move onto the balance sheet comparing year-end 2018 to 3\/31 of this year. Cash decreased approximately $4.292 billion to approximately $47 million which is due to $22 million of Bcf plus net borrowings of $50 million offset by $3.977 billion in special distributions, $19 million in common dividend, $37 million paid on the final working capital adjustment on Trans Mountain paid to the government, $13 million of cash paid for expansion capital, $308 transmission of cash taxes paid on the Trans Mountain gain and a working capital other usable about $10 million.","Other current assets increased approximately $14 million primarily due to the prepaid asset associated with the federal income taxes that I mentioned earlier and a small increase in accounts receivable.","Net PP&E decreased by 17.3 as a result of depreciation in excess of net assets placed in service.","Leased assets increased from 0 to approximately $514 million as we adopted the new accounting rule ASC 842 which requires us to report present value of operating leases.","Deferred charges and other assets increased approximately $1.3 million primarily as a result of a contribution to the coach and reclamation process.","On the right hand side of the balance sheet, the credit facility balance increased by $50 million from zero as we borrowed a bit from general working capital needs. Distributions payable and distributions payable to related parties went to zero as we made the January 3rd special distributions of the Trans Mountain from sale proceeds. Currently these liabilities increased $17 million which is the current portion of the lease liability. That is the other side of the entry related to the ASC 842 lease accounting that I mentioned.","Other current liabilities decreased by approximately $363 million primarily due to the payment of the taxes payable on the gain that I mentioned $308 million in the final Trans Mountain working capital payment of $37 million that I mentioned to the government.","Lease liabilities increased by almost $497 million which is the long-term portion of lease liability that is the other side of the entry related to the ASC 842 lease accounting I mentioned. Other long-term liabilities increased by about $1 million primarily due to a small increase in the liabilities associated with the coach and reclamation process. From a liquidity perspective, we ended the quarter with $47 million in cash and significant available liquidity as we had only $50 million drawn out of the $500 million revolver. Our debt to LTM adjusted EBITDA ratio was just under 1.4. However given potential rating agency adjustments on operating leases and other items, this ratio is not necessarily indicative of our debt raising capability and our credit rating.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, thanks, Dax.","And before the Q&A as we've been doing for the last few quarters as a courtesy to all callers we're asking that you restrict yourself to one question and then one follow-up question and if you have more questions not answered please get back in the queue and we will come back around to you and answer your question. Okay. And with that, Jennifer you can open it up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","And our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Are you able to answer any questions about the KML process like the order does that mean anything?","Steve Kean","The order?","Shneur Gershuni","The order in the press release has the three options is it likelihood of success or preference?","Steve Kean","I hear you, Shneur. So, no, beyond the press release as would be customary when you're running a process like this we're just going to run the process and really not comment beyond what we've said publicly in the release.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, fair enough. Just a couple of questions here. You're spending $3.1 billion in CapEx this year. You've added $600 million to the backlog. You recently walked from the DLCC Board opportunity. Where do you see incremental opportunity to spend CapEx in the next 18 months based on -- in addition to where you're at right now and do you have kind of a sense on the zip code of what 2020 would look like would it be higher or lower than where you expect 2019 to shake out?","Steve Kean","On the last we're again continuing to guide to between $2 billion and $3 billion and we won't get to that finally until we do our budget for 2019. But I think to your first question as we mentioned in talking about what's going on in the Texas market and what's going on in Midstream generally as Kim took you through the numbers there. We continue to see good opportunities in natural gas which makes up 70% of the backlog. We're seeing some opportunities here and there in refined products; continue to see small incremental opportunities there. As the year goes on, there is less coming in 2019 and we feel comfortable with kind of what we guided to in terms of discretionary CapEx at the beginning of the year as being where we will end up with it. But that's where the opportunities are coming from, that's what we expect for 2019, and we're working on 2020 and beyond as we speak to take the $2 billion to $3 billion as a reasonable guide.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And a follow-up question. Given there seems to be a trend towards product exports. Is your operating leverage in your terminals and refined product system to be able to benefit around more export at a decent ship channel or what we're seeing right now kind of where you're at?","Steve Kean","Yes, there is. So we have 11 ship docks and 12 barge docks and we have been growing kind of at an 8% annual year-over-year rate --","John Schlosser","8.5%.","Steve Kean","8.5%.","John Schlosser","Year-over-year over the last five years.","Steve Kean","8.5% year-over-year over the last five years, as John points out. And you won't quite see that in the first quarter because we had some fog, we had some issues in the ship channel associated with the ICC incident which restricted that but it's not for a lack of demand to move U.S. refined products to overseas markets.","John Schlosser","And I don't think there's anybody better positioned than we are with the amount of docks there.","Steve Kean","Right. We have some spare capacity which is part of your original question.","Shneur Gershuni","All right. Perfect, thank you very much. Appreciate the color guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is open.","Colton Bean","Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up on the comments on leverage. You've seen some positive action from the ratings agencies but it does seem like balance sheet has shifted higher in the priority list for the public markets. Could you just provide an update as to how you're looking at the 4.5 times target and whether the strategy around capital allocation has shifted at all?","Steve Kean","Sure. We think the 4.5 is the right place to be for our particular assets given the size, the stability of cash flow, the diversity of the businesses that we have, the quality of customers, the dividend coverage you put all those things together we actually map higher than BBB flat. And we think that all of those factors with respect to our business is what has made the rating agencies comfortable with the upgrades that they've given us. So we think the 4.5 times given all of those considerations is a fine place to be.","Colton Bean","Got it. And then on KMCC, I think you all noted over the last few quarters that you have seen some rate reductions. Can you just update us as to where we stand in terms of the recontracting process there?","Steve Kean","Yes, sure. The recontracting process is ongoing and we do expect to see some additional capacity commitments forthcoming but granted at lower rates. The other thing -- the other key development for us on KMCC is that we've kind of set this out as a goal and talked about it over time as we want to get that type to access Permian Barrel.","So right now of course it primarily see -- it primarily is a takeaway for growing Eagle Ford production but there's a lot of capacity away from the Eagle Ford. So even as it grows, it takes a while to fill that capacity back up and hence the rate -- the rate reductions we're experiencing on the base business. But we participated in a Roanoke Expansion that open season was just extended to April 30. However we've got some pretty good commitments there and I think we're going to be successful in getting Permian barrels attracted to KMCC. And so that'll be a part of our picture going forward as we mitigate and add back some growth from the outside, okay.","Colton Bean","Got it. And just a quick follow-up on that, so you mentioned the Permian barrels, is there an ability to use that pipe as a logistical backstop for Corpus exports as well if you had a weather issue in Corpus could you use that to get barrels up to Houston market?","Steve Kean","Yes. And so that's if you put your finger right on it. So I think what we're seeing is that and for good reason is that I think customers are looking particularly at the early periods here and they're looking for an alternative. And there's really no better alternative than the Houston market with the refining base that we have with the access to the Pet Chem markets and global markets over docks all of the infrastructure that we and others have in the ship channel makes Houston an attractive market for these barrels. So it's -- I'd say more than a backstop it's a nice market outlet alternative, a nice market option that we'd expect to be particularly strong in the early days but we'll be around for a long time.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tristan Richardson","Hey good afternoon guys. Just briefly on the slightly lower EBITDA commentary, should we think of that deviation from budget is purely the incorporation of a final 501-G settlement you guys talked about last week or there's some other puts and takes to think about?","Steve Kean","Go ahead, Kim.","Kim Dang","There are some other puts and takes and obviously you've got the delay on elbow which has an impact versus the budget. The pension expense that David talked about which add back that non-cash pension expense and tracked out the cash contributions for DCF and that's why you see the difference between the EBITDA and DCF and then also impact of a slightly lower commodity prices primarily the NGL price impact on DCF.","Steve Kean","So the interesting thing, I think the interesting conclusion is that notwithstanding those moving parts and not all of them affect DCF and EBITDA the same way. But we're basically flat on DCF and slightly down on EBITDA and we've absorbed and put behind us the significant regulatory risk that we did not budget for settlements on. And so really that tells you that that the base business is strong and overcoming a lot in the way of headwind.","Tristan Richardson","Great, very helpful. And then just a follow-up could you talk about your potential JV project serving the Bakken and Rockies and just sort of the timing of the commercial process there and that evolution?","Steve Kean","Sure. So that's our project with Tallgrass and we are in customer discussions right now. We think we have a good project because it is using in significant part existing pipeline assets. So our AA system which is not something to be contributed to the joint venture but our -- one of our Vic medicine [ph] laterals and the Cheyenne Plains system which provides significant takeaway capacity really for three sources of supply.","One is the Bakken, second is some heavy barrels arriving from Canada at currency, and third is Powder River and DJ Basin barrels. There's also the PXP Systems that is part of the joint venture that Tallgrass is contributing. So bottom-line on all that is we're offering a lot of way to provide true takeaway capacity with a lot of existing pipe only about 200 miles of new build to get to Cushing with the converted gas pipes. So significant capacity probably more than we would expect to contractually fill up but we're in contractual discussions right now and I think we've got a good proposal for the market but not in the backlog and not nothing more definitive to announce at this point.","Tristan Richardson","Helpful. So could potentially have a decision this year?","Steve Kean","That's possible.","Operator","The next question comes from Gabriel Moreen. Your line is open.","Gabriel Moreen","Good afternoon everyone. First question for me is just what are the backlog around Bakken, GMP has just shifted it all upwards since the Analyst Day. Just curious whether that's -- that's you've added anything there?","Steve Kean","Yes. We've had had some capital additions there. We continue to see good performance from our customer shippers' there and particularly a compelling need for additional gas processing and takeaway capacity. And so we have added a couple of projects and call it 10 to million ballpark to what we already had in when we did the January conference.","Gabriel Moreen","Okay, thanks Steven, and I was going to ask on Tall Cotton now that Phase 2 is completed, can you maybe give us your latest thoughts on proceeding with Phase 3 given the performance out of the reservoir?","Steve Kean","So Tall Cotton as we said in the release, we've seen year-over-year growth in the production there. But it's behind our plan. And so frankly we are deferring further investment decisions in there until we get a better sense for downhaul conformance and in other words that we'd like to do to get confidence that we're going to get what we get confidence in what we're going to ultimately be able to recover from the reservoir.","In previous quarters we had talked about operational issues regarding compression and gas handling and things like that. We think we have those behind us at this point but it's still a question of what do we need to do in terms of conformance. And we're going to get ourselves satisfied on that before we make a further significant capital commitment to it.","Gabriel Moreen","And does oil price matter at all for that Steve or is it just agnostic of oil price?","Steve Kean","No, oil price always matters, fam. It always matters.","Operator","The next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Spiro Dounis","Hey good afternoon everyone. Just wondering if you could provide some guidance or maybe some color just around Waha gas prices and maybe some of the volatility negative basis we've seen their lately. Just wondering if you could expect that basis to stay negative and maybe even get worse over time until GCX comes online and is there anything you can do to actually to speed GCX up at this point?","Steve Kean","As I said at the beginning, we're doing everything we can for our customers there both with our existing infrastructure as well as prosecuting our projects just as quickly as we can. And we feel very good about our schedule on GCX and I think we're making extremely good progress there. I think to answer your question about basis, you have to take a lot of other things into account like what producer self help is available, more docks, and things like that and so we don't have any special insight into forward basis and how much of that can be mitigated by producer activity. But there's no question that there is heavy demand to get out of the Permian and we're doing our best to fill that demand for our customers.","Rich Kinder","Yes and I mean this is nothing that isn't already at the rides. There were two main drivers have caused little severe negative basis that we experienced over the last few weeks. Outages and then well really outages on an intrastate system and interstate system and so as those come back on things should relieve a bit. Then the other thing we're hearing [indiscernible] some of the dry gas portions of the Permian we're seeing some nominal shutdowns and so you get more relieved, out of the basin and so all that should improve somewhat but it's actively a pretty good market, really good. GCX online and then I think beyond that I think it's initiated a little bit very quickly and we could be in somewhere [indiscernible] next year.","Spiro Dounis","Fair enough. I appreciate that color. And then want to respect your process on Canada, so I won't ask specifically around that review but I guess we have new data points coming out of Alberta in terms of the government turning over there and that would seem to sort of favor energy in Canada. Just curious how much of that sort of factoring into your decision making process in general and maybe how you view the landscape there?","Steve Kean","Look I think we're generally we feel good about having the terminal position that we have in Alberta with the activity that it has with the customer base we have with what we've been able to see on contract renewals and the performance that we've had on our expansion projects up there. We're not really opining on governments and all of that we just work with our customers to get the do business as best we can. Of course other people have written about what they believe the implications are for the energy business and we just kind of refer to those.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Keith Stanley","Hi, good afternoon. On KML just the one thing in the statement is that I think before you guys have decided a transaction with KMI as one of the alternatives and that's not in the release this afternoon. Any color on why KMI, KML transactions not one of the options.","Steve Kean","I'm going to stick to my script Keith and just say what we say in the press release is kind of all we have to say about it at this point.","Keith Stanley","Okay. On the Permian gas side you guys have obviously led and been the only one successful in building a gas takeaway pipelines in the Permian. Is there any potential for a tender to build a third Permian pipeline even potentially just given the downstream sort of benefits on connectivity that you guys have?","Steve Kean","Yes. And there are some discussions ongoing. There's nothing to announce and of course it's not the backlog because we're not under contract or anything but the demand to get out of the Permian continues to grow and the desire to be able to unlock the value that's in oil and the NGLs as well as the natural gas continues to put pressure on the need for additional takeaway capacity.","And so short answer is, yes. And if you look at the projections they would show you that a GCX a year almost is what's required in order to satisfy the need for takeaway capacity and to unlock the value of the other commodities out of the Permian, I don't know that it's going to be anything like that pace or that is going to be at that pace. But there's certainly interest already in the Phase 3.","Operator","The next question comes from Dennis Coleman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Dennis Coleman","Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. If I can start maybe a little bit more on GCX, you talked about doing everything you can for your customers; I guess center of that is trying to get it online as soon as possible, some anecdotes that they're from different sources that it is well ahead of schedule. I guess maybe the simple question is how much ahead of schedule might you be able to come on, is it -- could it be are we talking weeks, is it months?","Steve Kean","This is a long pipeline with a lot of compressor stations to commission meter stations, to commission booster compression to commission and final testing and backfill all the things you have to do to get a pipeline a long linear asset where every inch is a critical path. All that work we have to do, so we're going to leave it at.","We're doing well. We're doing well on schedule. We're happy with where we are in the construction process and we're going to do everything we can to be there for our customers just as fast as we can. But because of -- because it's a long linear project with a lot of mechanical parts to it that we've got to get completed we're not comfortable in projecting some kind of an early in-service date anything other than the October 1st at this point.","Dennis Coleman","Sure. And that's totally fair. I guess maybe a different question is, the revenue turns on when you get FERC approval to put in service, I guess no FERC approval there?","Steve Kean","It\u2019s not a FERC pipeline. The contracts go into service, service and we're able to provide the two DCF capacity that's associated with this pipeline.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. My follow-up sort of more of a blue sky question, I guess but with the increase in gas production that you're talking about storage does come to mind particularly as we push up the volume of LNG that we're exporting. There hasn't been much growth in storage in recent years there is the old reason of somewhere in an arbitrage doesn't exist. Is that something that you'll look at over time or how do you think about storage as an opportunity maybe, maybe not in the next couple of years but beyond that as that volume grows?","Steve Kean","Absolutely, Tom?","Tom Martin","I mean clearly as the market grows polymetrically in the way, it's talked about today there's going to be a need for more storage over time. We and obviously certainly need commensurate value to expand storage capability beyond what we have today. And so we'll be watching that. I mean I guess the one comment I'll make that although the seasonal values have not really increased but probably contracted a bit. If you look at it historically, we've seen certainly, seen an increase in extrinsic value volatility value but if you look at the components of supply and demand that makes a lot of sense. So to the extent the sum of intrinsic and extrinsic rose and to support future expansion. Obviously customers hope that come in and stepped up behind all that. We'll look at expanding our storage footprint. We're in a great position with the existing capability we have across all of our markets today to provide storage service and that's an upside potential for us as the market rose.","Dennis Coleman","Great. Would you expect it to be more salt or more sort of single turn buildup?","Steve Kean","Yes, I think clearly with the volatility being more of the component and obviously by stopping renewables I think multi-cycle high delivery types of storage makes the most of it, which Tom's team has a lot of Texas and has -- is facing additional LNG demand coming on which is very chunky as well as additional supply coming on which in this case is chunky with Gulf Coast Express coming on. So having our Texas Intrastate System a significant amount of self-dome storage capability is an advantage as we see this play out.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two unrelated ones, one regards to connectivity for crude pipeline capacity between Corpus and the Houston Ship Channel and the Houston market, just curious are there lots of people concerned about enough pipeline capacity between the two markets relative to the size of exports and in them pipes. But there are opportunities to expand KMCC or are you looking at that market and seeing what could be congestion down the road as more inbound crude pipelines come online?","Steve Kean","Okay. So I think that it's not like there's a lot of pipe going from Corpus to Houston or other way around. However there is pipe that can't get to Corpus or can get to Houston. And if you look at Gray Oak for example, Gray Oak is being built all the way over to well being built to Freeport too but also to Corpus ultimately and it interconnects with it will interconnect with KMCC which then creates execution option.","So that creates the kind of connectivity that you're talking about. And as we said in response to your earlier question we expect that option to Houston to get some pretty good utilization as things come on and then yes, we do have expansion capability on KMCC as well.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. Kind of my apologies, coming hard to introduce said about 70,000, 75,000 barrels. We can talk offline on that. Then any change in status or thoughts about kind of the embedded call option that is both LNG in terms of just next step, next steps from here if any?","Steve Kean","We are going to continue to work with all of our stockholders defined write next step, we did today get approval of our EIS from the condition on the version that we filed earlier. But really there is nothing more to update or report at this point.","Operator","The next question comes from Mirek Zak from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Mirek Zak","Hi, good afternoon. Last week you nearly saw Presidential Executive Orders but this potentially create or renew any opportunities for you to move gas further into the northeast. Maybe something similar to the northwest direct or maybe not as large or has not enough change perhaps on the market demand side for anything to move forward.","Steve Kean","It\u2019s good but not that good. I think there's a lot -- there are a lot of others it is good, okay there does need to be some rationality in the way the delegated authority is handled by the states under the environmental regulations, their permitting authority. So that's a good thing just generally but there are a lot of things to work through in the Northeast on getting new pipeline infrastructure in place and we continue to work on those projects. Any D is a very big project and that's not a very likely resurrection, what we think is that we will find smaller one-off kind of -- one-off kind of projects to do work very closely with our utility customers and we have we have one of those that's ongoing right now and we're working on another.","Mirek Zak","Okay, great. And then switching to the Permian here on all your gas pipelines outlets out of the Permian, do you have any level of open or market capacity or any of those lines available to you that allows you to take some advantage of the low Waha pricing there and if so can you quantify the level at all?","Steve Kean","Yes, I mean everything that well first of all we do have takeaway capacity that's existing capacity out of the Permian. And so we do have the opportunity to take advantage of that provide outlets for our customers but every nook and cranny is in use.","Mirek Zak","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Kim Dang","By our customers.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","And the next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi good afternoon. Just wanted to touch based on the environment building pipeline Texas and your thoughts on how still the 991 and if there is any chance to pass this share and just in general is it getting a little bit more difficult or you take a little bit more time to build a pipes in Texas, any thoughts you could provide there?","Steve Kean","So yes, there is Texas legislature is in session right now and so there are number of builds are being considered regarding eminent domain and modifying the existing evident domain process. We had really and let me put it this way; this is not a traditional landowner versus pipeline issue any longer. I mean this is about the value of the Permian that benefits the entire State of Texas and the profound public interest that's at stake there when it comes to royalties, taxes, royalties going to the state to fund schools et cetera.","And so I think it's fair to say that people in the Texas legislature understand how important it is to unlock the value of this resource in the public interest and that's what you have eminent domain for. And so our view is that and what will emerge from that process ultimately will be a rationale properly balanced -- properly balanced approach to eminent domain. In the meantime we are actively working with our landowners in order to get concessional arrangements in place and we're using the existing process with eminent domain where that makes sense as well. But we don\u2019t currently see any kind of excess potential threat to our project by any stretch.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s helpful, thanks for that. Suppose you might not give a lot of color here but just trying to put your comments together as far as the impact to EBITDA guidance here, and is $50 million to $150 million of impact, is that kind of booking what we\u2019re looking at here or is this a right zip code or I'm off on that field?","Steve Kean","We\u2019re just going to stick with this slightly down and what that implies, it's not a material impact.","Jeremy Tonet","Got it. One last one if I could. IMO 2020 just wondering if that's any impact that you guys are seeing with regards to your storage position, any benefits that you guys see in the different storage areas of Houston?","Steve Kean","Yes, John Schlosser from our Terminals Group.","John Schlosser","It's a very small amount of flat visits less than 3% and it\u2019s under a long-term agreement, most of it here at our BOSTCO facility but there are opportunities for a segmentation project at BOSTCO to handle both high sulfur and low sulfur and as one of the largest handlers at this point in the United States, there is opportunities for blending there as well.","Jeremy Tonet","And it sounds like the New York market or anything else like that?","John Schlosser","It has not helped New York market, our opportunities are mostly in the Gulf Coast but there are smaller opportunities up and down the East Coast.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue at this time.","Steve Kean","Good. Thank you very much.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"12304":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

All lines have been placed on a listen only mode until the question-and-answer portion. ","Today\u2019s conference is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay, thank you Holly and welcome to everybody to our earnings call. As usual, we\u2019ll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.","I\u2019ll make some introductory remarks, then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Steve Kean, our President and Chief Operating Officer who will talk about operations and our project backlog and then we'll go to Kim Dang, who will take you through the numbers. And I want you to treat her respectfully, because we just named her as a Member of Office of the Chairman today. So I know you will keep that in mind.","Let me talk about first quarter to third quarter performance. There is really not a lot to report on the quarter or on our projections for the balance of the year. Steve and Kim will take you through it in more detail, except that we do now expect to exceed our $1.72 budget target for dividends at KMI and we expect to meet our targets at KMP, KMR and EPB. ","Our natural gas pipelines, particularly the inter-state portion of our group leading the year with a strong performance throughout the year. As an indication of the increased demand for transportation on our natural gas pipelines we now have new singed and pending long term contracts since December of last year, December \u201813 of 6.4 bcf\/d and to put that in perspective, that\u2019s about 9% of the total U.S. gas demand and that number, that 6.4 number is up from 5.3 at the end of second quarter. So we continue to make real progress in attaching new throughput agreements to our system. Steve will go into more detail on the operating performance across all of our segments. ","More significant for the future probably is the size of our backlog of new projects. We went from 17 billion in backlog at the beginning of the quarter to 17.9 billion at the end of the quarter, even after deducting about $1.1 billion of projects that were completed and placed in service during the quarter and thus removed from the backlog. The third quarter additions include some sizeable projects that Steve will discuss in detail. ","To me this growth demonstrates once again the demand from mid-stream energy infrastructure in North America and the size of our backlog, together with the enormous footprint of our Pipeline and Terminal assets is the best predictor of future growth at KM in my judgment.","Now, let me also update you on the transaction in which KMI is proposing to buy the outstanding units and shares in KMP, KMR and EPB. We have now received all necessary regulatory approvals, except our registration statement has not yet been declared effective by the SEC. We except to announce the date of our shareholders and unit holder meetings in the near future and we\u2019re hopeful we will be able to close by Thanksgiving.","To remind you, we expect the resulting consolidated KMI to pay a dividend of $2 dollars in 2015, that\u2019s an increase of 16% over the $1.72 budget target for \u201914; to increase that dividend by 10% a year through 2020 and to generate coverage in excess of $2 billion above these increased dividend payments.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, good afternoon. So I\u2019m going to review the business segments focusing on year-over-year performance, Q3 of last year to Q3 of this year of each one and the key developments in each segment. Starting off with gas, a very good year. KMP, their earnings before DD&A is up $53 million or 9% year-over-year and we continue to see strong performance at TGP and EPNG, as well as the assets that we picked up in the Copano acquisition.","Transport volume on the KMP assets is up 10% year-over-year. At EPB the DCF is up $23 million or 8% year-over-year, really due to the dropdowns of our interest in Gulf and Ruby that were announced in April this year. ","The gas group added on a net basis $100 million to the project backlog. That\u2019s after putting into service about $270 million. The biggest piece of that was the expansion of our Huston Central plant and some associated pipe expansions around that asset for about $250 million.","We had a net add at TGP of about $175 million, about the same number at the mid-stream assets and those were really both associated with LNG markets, as well as Mexico, so a net add of $100 million to the backlog in the gas group. ","We continue to see strong demand for natural gas infrastructure as Rich mentioned. We\u2019ve seen it in the shale\u2019s, LNG exports and Mexico. Our assets are well positioned for all of that as evidenced by the 6.4 Bcf of signup that we\u2019ve had. So the trends that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time are now turning themselves into long-term firm transport commitments.","And that\u2019s just mostly the supply side and some LNG and Mexico exports. That\u2019s before we\u2019ve really seen the demand side of this picture with power conversion in the U.S. and industrial and PetChem. on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And to illustrate that point, if look at our backlog you don\u2019t see anything in there, for those developments yet to come just yet, but we can see them over the horizon.","If you break our backlog out in the gas group, call it producer push projects are about $800 million out in the shale\u2019s. What I\u2019ll call first party LNG, which is really the Elba Island and related transportation expansions, about $1.6 billion. What I\u2019ll call second party LNG, which is where we\u2019re investing in infrastructure to serve other peoples LNG facilities is another $750 million. ","Mexico is over $900 million and processing and gathering primarily in the Eagle Ford is about $300 million, so that\u2019s about 4.4 or so of the total backlog and you can see we still got more to come with these other developments. Still haven\u2019t seen the full effect of power and industrial PetChem. on the U.S. Gulf Coast and I think we\u2019ll also see some additional LNG and all of those things are things that we are well positioned for. ","You would also think with all of this demand side growth and what\u2019s happening on the supply side, that we are going to see an enhanced value on our storage assets as well and that is I think also is still to come.","And also a remainder, the backlog that we have in the gas group does not yet include Northeast direct of Gulf LNG projects, which we continue to actively work. So again, more to come on our well positioned gas network.","Turning to CO2; earnings before DD&A is up $14 million or 4% year-over-year. On the volume side SACROC is up 12%, a huge performer. NGL\u2019s are also up 7% year-over-year. Yates is down a little bit, 3.4%. Katz volumes are up 27.3% and Goldsmith is basically flat. Overall volumes on a net basis are up 9% year-over-year and really great performance in SACROC with nearly every program that we\u2019ve put in place there for 2014, exceeding our expectations. ","The disappointment from a production standpoint is Goldsmith, which is essentially flat year-over-year. I would characterize the issues here as being less about geology then they are about operations. The oil is there, it\u2019s down the well bore, but we\u2019ve had outages at the wells and outages associated with our pumps there. These are similar, but not identical problems that we have solved in other places, including SACROC, so we\u2019ve got a full court press to turn things around here. ","The other even bigger disappointment in the CO2 group is net oil prices taking the Midland Cushing differential into account. That differential alone more than explains CO2\u2019s entire shortfall to its plan this year. So very strong volume performance at SACROC and the NGL\u2019s year-over-year up-ticks at Katz. Work to be done at Goldsmith in particular. ","Turning to the backlog it\u2019s evenly split now in CO2 between the S&T and EOR parts of our business with about $2.1 billion each. We added this proportionately to the S&T portion of the backlog in the quarter-over-quarter change that we had.","Looking ahead, we are going to be focusing our attention on Goldsmith and we\u2019ve begun hedging and looking at other physical sales strategies that we can use to manage the Midland Cushing spread issue.","On the product side, earnings before DD&A are up $20 million or 10% year-over-year. The increase came from our year-over-year earnings growth on our less refined products lines. KMCC had a big up-tick year-over-year, Southeast Terminals and Cochin and those positives more than offset declines at West Coast Terminals and Transmix.","Interestingly, refined products volumes here were up 6.8% year-over-year and up 4.1% if you exclude parkway, which we put into service late in Q3 of last year. Contrast that with the EIA, where nation wide, the increase in refined products was only 0.8% on a year-over-over basis. Plantation volumes really led the way here as demand to move U.S. Gulf Coast refined products to our markets remains very strong. ","In addition, the nice increase we saw in refined products volume, the backlog shows strong demand for additional NGL condensate and crude infrastructure. If you look at the composition of the backlog here, there is a little over $0.5 billion that\u2019s associated with UTOPIA and Cochin. Those projects and another 550 associated with crude and condensate at KMCC, including our splitter project there and another 20 or so on miscellaneous refined products and blending operations. So a good chunk of demand for crude and condensate in NGL\u2019s in particular. ","The products group also increased their backlog over $100 million, while placing into service over $400 million worth of projects during the quarter. The two big ones being Cochin and the completion of a number of KMCC related expansions and the big addition being the UTOPIA project moving ethane and ethane propane mix for NOVA, as well as potentially some other customers up to Cochin and then into the Windsor-Sarnia area. We also had another $50 million plus of additions to KMCC related expansion projects.","And I have to say overall, both in gas and especially in products, the project, the execution on the projects in this segment remains very good. They think their numbers are better with a notable exception schedule wise of a delay in the first phase of the splitter project in the Huston Ship Channel, but from a cost stand point they are hitting their numbers better.","And a remainder here too, that the backlog does not yet include the Y-Grade project UMTP or Palmetto. We continue to work on those prospects. Palmetto is in the middle of an open season right now until the end of this month and on a combined basis these projects if they come to fruition would add another $4 billion to the backlog.","Terminals; turning to Terminals. Earnings before DD&A year-over-year are up $48 million or 25%. That is the biggest; I believe the biggest ever year-over-year up-tick in performance for the terminal segment. About 70% of that is organic placing a number of projects into service versus 30% on the acquisition side, which is primarily the APT acquisition.","We did experience weakness on our coal export volumes though we do have some protection in our contracts with minimum payments, but we continue to see on the plus side very strong demand for liquids infrastructure and that\u2019s evidenced by a net increase to the backlog of about $300 million, even while putting $200 million worth of projects into service. ","The current backlog is predominantly liquids related. It breaks down \u2013 there\u2019s about $600 million worth of crude by rail projects that are in the backlog; about $400 million associated with building out the APT tankers; another $1.4 billion that\u2019s other liquids tankage and dock and piping infrastructure and the bulk is only about $80 million of our backlog currently.","Looking ahead, here we expect to continue to see growth in demand for the liquids infrastructure. I think that demand extends also to our existing assets in Houston and Edmonton where we continue to see nice renewal rates on that, but also extends to expansions. On the downside, we except to see continued weakness in coal volumes in the next year.","Lastly Kinder Morgan Canada and the big story here continues to be the Trans Mountain Expansion. Just a remainder here, this is fully under contract. We\u2019ve got NEB approval of the commercial and economic terms of those contracts. Our development costs are almost entirely covered on this project and we do have good cost protection on the most difficult parts of the built. ","Last quarter when we had this call we had just received word of a six month, three-week delay in the deadline for an NEB decision. So they moved it from July of 2015 to January of 2016, but at that time we had not yet assessed the full impact of that to the schedule. Other than to note that we would be moving from late 2017 to a 2018 in service date, we\u2019ve spent the intervening time assessing the routs, alternatives in Burnaby. We\u2019ve looked at our construction schedules very closely and can tell you that we expect now a Q3 and frankly a late Q3 of 2018 in the service for Trans Mountain now. ","The main thing that\u2019s going on there is a separate proceeding for the NEB to assess the alternative routes between Burnaby Mountain and the dock, where our terminal facility is down to the dock. We are in the middle of that process and in the middle of a dispute with Burnaby over how to assess that. We had to examine our construction schedule closely, looking at things like the effect on clearing schedules as fish and wildlife considerations etc., and that pushed us to a Q3, 2018 in service. ","Not withstanding the local disputes, we continue to make good progress to the application process and we still expect to get our permit on this project and build this expansion. So that\u2019s the run down on the business units and the major projects. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim for a more detailed look at the numbers.","Kim Dang","Thanks Steve. So starting with KMP and the GAAP income statement, you could see there today the KMP Board declared a distribution per unit of $1.40; that\u2019s a $0.05 increase or 4% from the three months in 2013. As a result, we will declare distribution over nine months of $4.17 or an increase of 5%.","Now you can see on income from continuing operations that we\u2019re up 40%. If you want to look at it on a per share number, we are up 78%. We don\u2019t think that these are the right numbers to focus on, because we don\u2019t think it gives you an accurate picture of what\u2019s going on at KMP. ","So if you turn to the second page and numbers, you can see that we \u2013 DCF per unit for the quarter is $1.31. That compares to the declared distribution of $1.40. So we have about 0.9, 4 times coverage about $42 million short of coverage.","As we told you last quarter and we told you on almost every quarter, that we expect negative coverage in the second and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first and the fourth and for the year to have positive coverage. ","Now, in terms of net income per unit, when you strip out the certain items, we are at $0.57. I\u2019ve seen a couple of notes out there that we\u2019ve missed the consensus earnings. Let me point out that even though we don\u2019t think earnings is the right thing, earnings per unit is the right thing to focus on. We do give you a budget every year of earnings per unit. We also provide a distribution of how that number breaks out across the year. ","So if you take our number of $2.57 and multiply by the percentage, you would get $0.57 per unit. So we are right on top of our budget at KMP and if you look at the other two companies, those which I still know that we missed the consensus, EPB is $0.001 short of that calculation as for our publish numbers, budget publish budget numbers and KMI is $0.001 above. So I can\u2019t really comment on where the consensus earnings are coming from, but they are obviously not consistent with the budget that we put out, which we have been very consistent in achieving over time.","DCF in total for KMP is $607 million, up $53 million or 10% in the quarter, so nice growth in total DCF in the quarter for the nine months $1.861 billion, up $252 million or 16%. And so let me reconcile for you the $53 million that were up for the quarter and the $252 million that were up for the nine months. ","If you look at segment earnings before DD&A, we are up $141 million or 10%. About 72% of that is coming from two segments, Natural Gas and Terminals. But we also had nice increases coming out of CO2 and products. Our Natural Gas is up about $53 million and Terminals was up about $48 million. Steve took you through all the reasons for that, so I won\u2019t reiterate that, but nice growth coming out of the segments. ","Then you focus on the expense side of the equation. G&A is actually \u2013 there was an expense of $129 million on the quarter that\u2019s a reduction. So G&A expense is lower than it was in the third quarter of \u201913 by about $8 million and that\u2019s the result of higher capitalized overhead as a result of our capital expansion program.","Interest was an expense of $238 million in the quarter. That's about an increase of $17 million over the third quarter of 2013 and that is the result of higher average balances as a result of acquisitions and expansion capital, slightly offset so by some lower rate. ","Then sustaining CapEx was increased $29 million in the third quarter of this year versus the third quarter 2013. That\u2019s within about 2% of our budget and it\u2019s actually about $3 million higher than our budget, but as I\u2019ll tell you in a minute, year-to-date we are slightly behind our budget, so it\u2019s largely timing. ","So if you take the segment\u2019s up 141, G&A is a positive $8 million, interest expense negative $17 million, sustaining CapEx $29 million, the GP incentive is up $37 million as a result of higher distributions per unit and more units outstanding and then we have some other items that are a negative $13 million and that\u2019s largely just in our calculation at DCF we make some adjustments for things that are not cash that are in earnings and so $13 million there that gets you to the $53 million.","If you look at the nine months, the $252 million, our segments are up $575 million or 14%. 83% of that growth again is coming out of Natural Gas and Terminals, with gas being up $355 million, Terminals being up $125 million, but we also saw nice growth coming out of CO2 and products.","On the expense side of the equation, G&A is an increased expense versus the nine months last year of about $20 million. Interest is up about $74 million, again a higher balance slightly offset by lower rate. The sustaining CapEx is about $82 million, but year-to-date we are about $23 million lower than our plans on sustaining CapEx. ","So we budgeted for sustaining CapEx to increase, but some of that is timing. Actually for the year, we are going to be about $16 million positive to our plan. Some of that, about half of that is just a reclassification to OpEx. So OpEx is higher than we would have expected. Sustaining CapEx is a little bit lower than we would have expected. That explains about half of the $16 million variance.","But back to the nine months, $82 million and increased sustaining CapEx; the GP incentive up $137 million for the same reasons higher distribution per unit, higher units outstanding and then other items of about $10 million gets you to the $252 billion.","So versus our budget where we currently expect to end up the year, we currently expect to end up on budget in terms of DCF and DFC per unit. But let me give you a little more insight into that. ","The segments are going to be very, very close on a percentage basis. On an absolute dollar basis they are going to be slightly below and that\u2019s a result of nice increases in GAAP versus our budget, primarily as a result of new contracts and increased transport revenue on TGP and EPNG. It\u2019s a result of contributions from and Terminals from the APT acquisitions. And then these positives are more than offset negative impact of the Midland Cushing differential as Steve mentioned, weaker coal volumes than we would have expected, some project delays and lower condensate volumes. ","The slightly below on the absolute dollars from the segment is being offset by positive variances on G&A interest, GP incentive and sustaining CapEx to leave us on budget overall for the year. ","Now in terms of KMP\u2019s balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $21.5 billion in debt. That results in a debt to EBITDA of about 3.8 times. The debt increased in the quarter $817 million and it increased almost $2 billion, $1.99 billion for the nine months. So I\u2019ll take you through the change in debt, the drivers of the change in debt. ","One the quarter we spent about $1.16 billion in terms of acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We raised about $328 million in equity and then we had a contract buyout that was about $200 million positive, and that was the main certain item back on the income statement, it was the benefit, the earnings benefit of that buyout, but we also received cash for that. And then we have working capital and other items that were a use of capital of about $181 million. ","Now let me say, there are tons of moving parts under here given the size of the company that we are, but they net out and so what you\u2019re left with is primarily a use of working capital associated with accrued interest, because we make our interest payments on our debt, primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter. Accrued interest was a use of working capital, of about $186 million in the quarter. ","Year-to-date, $1.99 billion increased in the debt balance. We spent about $3.7 billion in terms of acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We had 1.1 of acquisitions with the largest one being the APT acquisition of $961 million that we did in the first quarter. Expansion CapEx was $2.3 billion and then we had about $300 million of contributions to equity investments. ","We raised $1.7 billion in equity. We had a little under a $200 million receipt of cash from the contract buyout, and then we had a use of working capital and other items of $178 million. Again, a lot of moving pieces, but the primary use of working capital was accrued interest. So that\u2019s it for KMP. ","Looking at EPB, EPB for the quarter is declaring a distribution of $0.65. That is flat with the third quarter of 2013; that result and a declared distribution of $1.95 for the nine months, which is a 3% increase versus the nine months of 2013. ","When you look at EPB\u2019s DCF in the quarter, its DCF was $0.65 versus the declared distribution of $0.65 to write out one times coverage. The DCF per unit is up 12% versus the third quarter of last year, so very nice growth in DCF per unit. Year-to-date, DCF per unit is $2.02 versus the distribution of $1.95 and so about $15 million of positive coverage for the nine months on EPB. The $2.02 was up about 3% from the nine months in 2013. ","DCF in total $150 million was up $23 million or 18% for the three months. For the nine months $454 million, up $29 million or 7%. Well, let me reconcile for you the $23 million increase in DCF for the quarter and the $29 million increase in DCF for the nine months. ","The top line of the page you can see earnings before DD&A, $3 million. That generally is where you expect to see the increase in cash coming from our assets. But because the drop downs that we did were both joint ventures, as you know we adjust our DCF calculation to add back JV DD&A and subtract our share of sustaining CapEx. And the reason we do that is to more closely reflect the cash distributions that we receive from these investments. ","So if you add back the JV DD&A, the change in JV DD&A from the quarter in 2013 to the third quarter in 2014, that\u2019s a $31 million increase, and then we have a $3 million adjustment down in our DCF calculation to adjust out some of the non-cash items, primarily differed revenues and AFUDC, that\u2019s about a $3 million negative in the quarter. ","So really the assets contribution is up about $31 million. The may drop down contributed about $46 million and then we had some degradation in S&G and WIC associated with the rate cases and also WIC associated with lower rates on contract renewals. ","On the expense side of the equation G&A interest sustaining CapEx, G&A is actually down $1 million versus the third quarter of 2013. Interest is up, so increased expense about $3 million is associated with interest expense from financing the drop. Sustaining CapEx is up about $3 million and that gets you to about $26 million of improved cash flow. The GP incentive is up $3 million because of more units outstanding. That gets you to $23 million increase in DCF in the quarter. ","Year-to-date, the $29 million earnings before DD&A, again up $6 million, similar story here. You also have to add back the change in the JV DD&A, its about $52 million and then take out items that we adjust that are non-cash to get to DCF, which is a negative $9 million. That gets you to about a $49 million increase coming from the assets. They drop about $77 million benefit in the quarter and then again in the year-to-date, and then again similar story on WIC and S&A down versus the nine months of 2013 on the rate cases and on the case of WIC as a lower contract renewal. ","If you look at G&A interest in sustaining CapEx, the change in those is about a $2 million increase in total combined for the nine months. Take that off of the $49 million from the assets. That gets you to a $47 million increase. The GP incentive was up about $18 million on Morgan for higher distribution to get you to the $29 million. ","EPB is having a good year. EPB we expect to be in our budget right now. On a DCF we are running slightly ahead of our budget and that\u2019s coming from basically a little bit better performance across the board. Better performance from the assets, a little bit lower G&A, lower interest and lower sustaining CapEx. ","Looking at EPBs balance sheet, EPB totaled into the quarter with total debt of $3.642 billion. That is a debt to EBITDA of about four times and so up from the end of the year, but consistent with EPB\u2019s budget. The change in debt in the quarter is a reduction of $99 million for the year. Its an increase of $464 million. ","In the quarter we spent about $23 million in terms of expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued about $76 million in equity and then working capital and other items were sources of cash of $46 million, which is primarily accrued interest and accrued taxes. ","Year-to-date acquisitions expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments was a use of cash of $1.28 billion with the biggest component of that being the $972 million for the dropdown. We issued a little under $500 million of equity, $498 million, and then we have a little over $66 million source of working capital in other same factors as on the quarter, primarily accrued interest and accrued taxes. ","Retuning to KMI. KMI, we are declaring, the Board declared a dividend today of $0.44 per share. That is $0.001 above where we would have expected to be for the third quarter and that is why you see our guidance that we expect to exceed our $1.72 budget. ","That result and a declared distribution for the nine months of $1.29, which is an 8% increase over the nine months in 2013. The $0.44 compares to cash available of $0.42, so we are slightly negative on coverage as we would have expected similar to KMP and as we tell you almost every quarter, we expect negative coverage in the second and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first and the fourth and to be approximately one time for the full year. For the nine months, the cash available of $1.29 is equivalent to the declared distribution of $1.29, so right at one times coverage. ","Cash available to pay dividends, $435 million in the quarter up $11 million or 3% for the nine months, $1.34 billion up $109 million or 9%. So let me reconcile the $11 million increase in the quarter and the $109 million increase for the nine months. ","In the quarter the cash coming from KMI\u2019s investments in the MLPs, so from its GP and LP interest it was up $48 million or 8%. The cash generated from other assets was down $47 million as a result of the dropdowns, and then the combination of interest G&A and taxes was a benefit of about $10 million, meaning we had less expense in the third quarter of this year than we did in the third quarter of last year and that leaves you up about $11 million. ","On the nine months, the cash coming from the MLP\u2019s up $182 million or 10%. The cash generated from other assets are down $76 million. Again, this is a function of dropping down assets to EPB and to KMP. ","And then interest G&A and taxes, the expense items are a benefit of $3 million; that\u2019s lower G&A and interest more than offsetting higher taxes, leaving you up $109 million in the quarter. Versus our budget, we are slightly ahead of our budget in terms of cash available to pay dividends and as we said, we expect to exceed the dividends per share of $1.72. ","Looking at KMIs balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $9.3 billion of debt. If you look at the fully consolidated number of $35.5 billion, that is 4.9 times on a fully consolidated basis debt to the last 12 months EBITDA and we are on target for when we closed the transaction to be at about 5.6 times as we laid out in the Investor Presentation.","The change in debt in the quarter is up $54 million. It\u2019s down a little under $500 million, $493 million year-to-date. On the $54 million we posted margins of about $60 million and then we had a whole host of other items that comprise the difference to get you to $54 million increase in debt. ","Those include the fact that KMR that we included in the metric as cash. We did not choose to sell those shares and so that\u2019s a $23 million use of cash. We have a $63 million benefit from the fact that we actually paid lower capital taxes, that\u2019s what in the metric, because we straight lined if you will the NOL that we got in the El Paso acquisition versus on a true cash tax purpose of the metric versus on a true cash tax basis we are using that up as quickly as we can. ","We had about $18 million in one-time items primarily, the legacy El Paso environmental and marketing and then we had some transaction costs associated with putting the bridge in place and with the SEC filings and banking fees. ","For the year-to-date, $493 million, we received $875 million in dropdown proceeds. Year-to-date we\u2019ve repurchased $192 million between warrants and shares. We had about a $60 million margin call. This is where we posted cash instead of LCs, because there is a benefit. It was cheaper to post the cash and so we converted it from an LC to cash. ","We made a pension contribution of $50 million and then we had about $83 million in working capital and other items. So again KMR was about $69 million. The difference between the cash taxes and the metric was $189 millions. Of course the one-time items were $89 million use on distributions we receive and dividends we paid, about a $72 million use and then we had about $39 million in terms of transaction costs, debt issue cost associated with refinancing our revolver earlier in the year and then the financing on the bridge and the revolver for the transaction. ","So with that, I\u2019m done. ","Richard Kinder","Okay. Thank you Kim and I might add that this will get a lot simpler. Hopefully by the next time we talk we\u2019ll be one company instead of three. And with that Holly, we\u2019ll open the floor for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir (Operator Instructions) And the first comes from Carl Kirst with BMO. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey Carl, how are you doing?","","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey thanks, good Rich. A couple of questions if I could on the backlog and the first really is to maybe just get a little bit more for a fine sense of UMTP. I guess the shipper paying sort of ended at the end of August. To the extent that that\u2019s still in negotiations, is that something you are looking to just negotiate through this winter to see how the NGL basis does and whether you might get more people to sign on at that point. How long do you let it go before you start looking at a Tennessee Gas back oil project again?","Rich Kinder","Okay, I think we continue to pursue this project, because we continue to see very strong interest in it and each period that we go out to survey the field and survey the market, it seems like we generate more interest from the period prior. But we haven\u2019t been able to turn that into sufficient credit worthy country party commitments to carry the project through and allow us to put it on a backlog and actively pursue its development. ","Well, we are actively pursuing its development, so the kind of the reset that we\u2019ve done Carl is to say, what does the market really need out there. We think the market really needs about 2018 in service day and there has been a lot of talk for a while about 2017. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much harm in the 2018 in-service date and so we\u2019ve adjusted our spend and our development work. That moves us to 2018 in service, but it allows us to continue the development of the project at a lower coast as we pursue abandonment on the Tennessee Gas Pipeline System.","So I think the short answer is it still looks like a very viable project. We are still working it very hard. We found a way to continue to develop the project as the market matures into it and that\u2019s what we expect to happen. ","We do as you pointed out, always have the option of going to a Southbound Tennessee hall. It\u2019s not a large amount of capacity that this line represents and so I think it\u2019s a much more attractive opportunity for us as a company to pursue the Y-Grade line and so we\u2019ll continue to do that unit its apparent that there is not going to be sufficient commitments coming forward. ","We think it\u2019s the best long term, most efficient solution for the customers out there and we are counting on them realizing it at some point here. ","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Great and I appreciate the color and maybe just one other question. Looking at New England, I think obviously a very big potential project. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong. My recollection is that at least on the market piece, the LDCs have signed up for roughly 0.5 Bcf\/d and you all were just in filing for Maine and I guess depending on if they bite that might be something that could potentially push you over the commercial transom. And my question is how long do you think that process takes for the state of Maine to evaluate that satiation. Is this a first quarter, second quarter \u201915, just any kind of zip code you might have. ","Rich Kinder","Well Carl, this is Rich. Its complicated a bit by the fact that the Chairman is leaving at the of the year. That said, there seems to be a great deal of interest by the State of Maine in pursuing this project and we are working with them and pushing them to get a decision just as quickly as we can. ","We are working there towards critical mass. We haven\u2019t put it in the backlog yet and won\u2019t until we get that critical mass. We are working with a number of customers for additional capacity and that project again looks just certainly something that\u2019s needed for New England and we are also looking very seriously at our ability to reroute certain parts of that to obviate some of the uproar we\u2019ve had in the Berkshires about where our pipeline is running. ","We think we found solutions to rout the great bulk of it along the light of way, which would not be as disturbing as the original plan was. We think the original plan took into account the needs and issues with the potential neighbors, but we are going back to drawing board a bit on that and we\u2019ll be looking. We haven\u2019t filed the final rout yet. We\u2019ll be looking to do that as we move forward. ","So that\u2019s a project that again we continue to move forward on, but we obviously have to see the critical mass before we put that in the backlog and announce it as a definite go project. ","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Understood. Those are my questions and meant to pass on my congrats to Kim, so I\u2019ll do that now. ","Kim Dang ","Thanks Carl. ","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Carl. ","Operator","Thank you and the next question is from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Rich Kinder","Hey Ted, how are you?","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Hey Rich, I\u2019m doing well thanks. Maybe just start with the moving oil prices here and can you give us an update on where your hedge percentages are as we look out for the next one to three years. And maybe also sensitivity analysis on say $1 move in oil prices. How will that impact DCF for 2015? ","Steve Kean","Okay, so for 2015 right now we have about 64% hedged at a price of 90.53, 2016 we are 46% hedged, a price of 85.86; for 2017 we are 33% hedged at a price of 83.14 and for 2017 we are 17% hedged at 83.80. ","By the time we get to the end of this year, the beginning of next year, we would expect to be about 80% hedged on 2015, which would leave our sensitivity similar to what it has been in prior years of about $7 million in DCF per dollar change in the barrel of oil. ","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Great. That\u2019s very helpful thanks. Next question is just on the shareholder vote here. Maybe its sounds like its been delayed a little bit more than what we have thought it was going to be, anything there? And then as you talk to the KMP unit holders in particular, where is your level of confidence in terms of getting that majority vote you need. ","Rich Kinder","Well, let me say first of all, its not delayed. We said sometime late in the fourth quarter. We would be happen if we can say we are hopeful. We are moving it forward to get it ready for Thanksgiving. ","And I\u2019m going to turn it over to David Michaels. David, you want to take them through the analysis of the KMP unit holders. ","David Michaels","Hey Ted. The way to remind you, the way with the KMR voters, shareholders will be able to direct their I-units (ph) to vote in the KMP unit holder vote. So that represents about 28% of the total KMP unit quarter base and if you break it down and use some reasonable estimates on how institutional KMR holders will vote and how KMR retail holders will vote, we think that that will represent about 22% of KMPs votes. ","If you add on top of that KMP insider votes and KMIs ownership of KMP that gets you to about 30% of the total votes that we think is reasonably assured vote for the transactions. That would leave us with about 97 million units needed to get us to the 51% level and that\u2019s 97 million units out of about 300 million units remaining outside of those contingencies that we just walked through. ","And of the 297 million that remain, and we need 97 million out of, 90 million of those are institutional owners and we think that those are going to turn out overwhelmingly in favor of the transactions. We feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to get there, but we are not taking it for granted. We are going through a very thorough proxy solicitation process once the S-4 is deemed effective.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Very, very helpful. Thank you for the detail. And then if I can get one more in, obviously you had a sort of big sell off in kind of the market here, including some of the mid-stream assets. I\u2019m just wondering if you are seeing any even better opportunities potentially out there now, given some of the asset values maybe a little lower than where they were before.","Rich Kinder","I think in the long run if there\u2019s a potential, possibly for it to be beneficial in exactly that way, but its certainly too early to predict. You guys see where this thing settles out and of course the mid-stream sector rallied pretty nicely this afternoon and KMI was up about I guess close to 3% or 2.5% as were a number of other energies. So we\u2019ll just have to see where it is, but certainly I think in the long run the outcome of this will be asset values might change a bit, that would give an opportunity for a company like Kinder Morgan to link more acquisitions.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon.","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Hi, good afternoon everyone and congratulations Kim. I was just wondering if you can sort of take a step back from specifically talking about micro issues with KMI. As Ted just mentioned, the markets been challenging in the last few weeks. We had this big decline in oil and just we\u2019ve seen these steep declines in the past. ","I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the discussion process that you have with producers before you start the contingent process. Talk us through maybe how they think about short term pricing trends versus long term pricing trends as they establish their CapEx and how they come to you in terms of how you provide solutions in terms of resolving bottlenecks and so forth, and how we should be thinking about CapEx given the short term volatility that we\u2019ve seen.","Rich Kinder","Well, first of all of course we are talking about a broad range of projects here ranging from CO2 supply contracts on one hand to natural gas and products pipeline projects on the other. ","With regard to most of our mid-stream pipeline issues, we don\u2019t see much change as a result of lower prices. In fact you could make in contrary an argument that a lower deck of prices on crude and NGLs will have a positive effect on people ramping up petrochemical usage in the months and years to come. ","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a negative on our ability to as you put it, get around these bottlenecks and resolve the issues and clearly so much of it now as Steve pointed out is returning to demand pull for this; the ONG users, the petrochemical users and other users, other users from the demand side. ","Now I think it\u2019s a different issue on the CO2 side and there we\u2019ve looked very carefully at what we think are sort of clearing prices and this is going to vary widely with who the producer is and what needs they have, but let me start by saying that we have floors on the great bulk of our contracts. So while there is some movement up and down with the oil and that\u2019s part of the $7 million per $1 that Kim was referring to, we do have floors across the board on that.","If you then look at, well what does it really take in the Permian Basin for people to longer drill, we think from the standpoint of a flood that\u2019s already going, just incremental CO2, to expand the flood is probably in the $40 to $45 range. We think for instituting a new flood in the Permian Basin and this is based on our own experience at SACROC, we think its probably closer to $60.","Now let me say it again, that\u2019s going to vary with the acreage; that\u2019s going to vary with the producer, but what it says to us is that CO2 floods are certainly economic at prices well below where the current price of oil is and so that\u2019s I think certainly something that we will watch very carefully on a going forward basis, both on the S&T side of our CO2 operation and obviously on the OR side. But so far this is not a big issue for us in terms of what\u2019s moving forward with our projects in our view at this time.","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Thank you Rich for that perspective. Just two quick follow-up questions. You sort of talked about the closing of your shadow backlog to backlog in the prepared remarks. I was wondering if you can sort of give us a sense of maybe shadow backlogs today with incremental projects added to the shadow backlog or do they just buy what\u2019s beneath the cross.","Rich Kinder","Yes. I mean if you look at the projects that I mentioned as I went through each of the business units and just added all those up, on an ADH basis that\u2019s about $15 million to $16 million, actually probably $15 billion to $17 billion when you take the ranges into account and that included Palmetto, the Y-grade line, NEB, one other one, what\u2019s that? ","Steve Kean","Yes, Gulf LNG.","Rich Kinder","Yes. So I think that\u2019s a substantial part of it. Some of this will have some overlap, but I think in the gas curve we about an $18 billion, a shadow backlog that will double up on NEB and Gulf LNG in that respect. So there are a lot of projects out there that we\u2019re pursuing and they have some reasonably probability associated with them. Its just that they are not high enough probability for us to call them sort of near sure things. ","But that\u2019s the order of magnitude and we continue to \u2013 those are some of the big ones, the four that I called out are some of the big ones. There\u2019s a lot of smaller projects in the terminal sector, things in CO2 that we\u2019re looking at, the products pipeline, there continues to be a number of projects for build out there. ","So again, I think the environment is just very good for us and I think we are very close to turning a couple more of those on the backlog, moving them from one to the other, but just didn\u2019t quite get there this quarter, but I think may make some progress here in the coming quarter.","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Okay. And one last final question if I may. You certainly talked about contract renewals at the beginning all on gas lines. Have you seen any trends towards producers who are going to take the longer-term contract renewals versus what typically would do on a renewal. Is there sort of any lengthening that\u2019s going on, as well as are you seeing that from a pricing perspective.","Rich Kinder","Yes, I\u2019ll turn it to Tom Martin for that.","Tom Martin","Yes, we definitely are. I mean I think you have to look at it on a regional basis, but clearly the activity that we are seeing out west on the AT&G, we are seeing both producers and end users stepping into longer term agreements on existing capacity and also sponsoring expansion projects. ","Certainly Tennessee Gas we\u2019re seeing much of that driver to this point being producer orientated, both on existing capacity and on expansion capacity. But I think really not to say that that\u2019s part of the expansion and growth we\u2019ve seen in there, but we\u2019re certainly seeing a shift towards more on the market side now going forward than what we had seen over say the last year to year and a half and I think evidenced by really the last two quarters of all projects being sponsored predominantly more on the market side, in LNG as well as Mexico Exports and I think we\u2019ll start to see power and industrial expansion related projects in the coming quarter.","Rich Kinder","Yes and sort of the symbolic of that is what we announced yesterday afternoon. We have two new projects on the gas group side. 500 a day going to \u2013 I still want to call it MGI, its Mixed Gas now, long-term contract. That\u2019s on top of \u2013 in excess of 500 a day that we signed up several months ago. ","So that\u2019s a little over $1 billion a day going into Mexico on long term contracts, just to cross our systems and then we also announced yesterday, associated with that on that Lone Star project another 300 a day, which we have an end user signed up for that capacity and in fact that may even be at large just as we go through the open season, but what we announced yesterday was just that we would perceive with the 300, we have enough to make it a valid project. So that\u2019s the kind of end user demand we are seeing and its definitely linking the terms. ","I think we are even seeing people as capacity comes up and an open \u2013 on the bid situation where they have a low for, they now have to bid longer term in order to protect that capacity. People are saying I think that this capacity in general is only going to get more valuable as time goes on, as all these demand side projects come online.","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Great. Thank you very much for that perspective guys and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Mark Reichman with Simmons & Co. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Mark. How are you?","Mark Reichman - Simmons & Co.","Good, good, thank you. See with respect to the announced expansions at Pasadena and Galena Park, I was just wondering how you think about export opportunities in general in order with the LPGs, with iron products and even process comments. ","So I mean as you serve a existing storage and loading capacity, where do you think opportunities remain unfulfilled and also in light of a number of international refinery additions that are designed to yield ultra low sulfur diesel for export, how deep is the market? Do you think they\u2019ll accept growing our fine products exports from the US?","Rich Kinder","We\u2019re right in the middle of all of that and what we announced yesterday certainly involves that area Steve.","Steven Kean","Yes, so what we announced yesterday has significant tank expansion underwritten with some newly executed contracts from one shipper in particular and we had some previously executed contract and also includes an expansion of a ship dock to get out exactly what your talking about.","I\u2019m not sure that I can give you better numbers than what you can read other places in terms of what the demand is going to be for additional export capacity, but what I can tell you is that we are seeing people increasingly interested in capacity that they can get to a dock line and we have perhaps the biggest refined products storage position on the Houston Ship Channel and the combination of our Pasadena and Galena Park facilities and with some expansion at Bosco as well and we are expanding ship docks and we are expanding barge docks throughout that complex. So there is a lot of demand for that. ","We\u2019ve got on a smaller scale a project that we are looking at in our Fairless Hills Terminal in the Philadelphia area that would involve LPG export and I think those are the two big locations that your going to see the demand. You\u2019re going to see in the Houston Ship Channel. We\u2019ve got all that refined product capacity and a little bit on the North East where people are looking for ways to get the liquids product out of the Marcellus and Utica to overseas markets.","So what that aggregate number turns out to be, I don\u2019t know, but we didn\u2019t use to charge for or be able to charge for access to our docks and now we are charging for access to our docks and it is an extremely valuable bridge between the inter United States and the world market for refined products. So demand is going up. How far up it goes, who knows, but we base our judgments on what shippers are willing to commit to and we are seeing an up-tick in those commitments. ","Rich Kinder","And I think right now and frankly I haven\u2019t updates these numbers this quarter, but I think we believe we are handling something between a quarter and a third of all the refined products exported across the Houston and Belmont area. And then I think its also instructed that this storage is just so important and growing so dramatically and to put some numbers to that. ","I believe with this project that we announced yesterday on internals, I think that when completed will take the Galena Park project that combined Pasadena, Galena Park project over 30 million barrels of storage and if you add up everything we\u2019ve got on the Houston Ship Channel, I think when that\u2019s completed we\u2019ll be slightly over 40 million barrels of storage. ","So that\u2019s a really tremendous position to be in when you have the kind of need for export, the need for avoiding volatility and pricing. We think this storage is just going to be more and more valuable and we\u2019re seeing that in the market.","Mark Reichman - Simmons & Co.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Darren, how are you?","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Hey fine. Thanks Rich. Hope your doing well and Kim, congratulations on the appointment to the office of the Chairman. ","Just a couple of quick questions. The first, on TGP when I\u2019m thinking about broad run and the associated expansions you laid out, post anterior anchor commitment, if I start thinking about Rose Lake in Connecticut and the other initiatives that your working, is it fair to assume that there is going to be at lease to be, if not 1.2 bcf a day that could be hitting that West Virginia receive point and moving down to those delivery points in Mississippi and Louisiana. Because in looking at basis, specifically Tech OM2 and Dominion South and Olivia (ph), it would like that\u2019s probably one of the biggest areas for you guys to invest incremental capital.","Steve Kean","Yes, I mean I think we have started taking a look at what our next big project would be. I think it really boils down to what is the clearing price in the market for an incremental expansion, but I think there\u2019s more volume that wants to move southbound. We are seeing some customer interests and diversify some into Canada and saw we one other project announced yesterday into Chicago. ","So I think customers are looking at our portfolio approach, but I think as I\u2019ve said in other quarters, I think from our perspective we are needing a market-playing price north of $1 I think to the incremental projects to the Gulf Coast. At least the initial feedback we\u2019re getting at this point is as I said, probably still a little bit on the high side.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then Rich, if I could go back to an earlier comment that you made regarding the northeast energy direct project and rerouting that or moving along the existing rights away, is that the variance between the original cost estimates that you outlined of $6 billion and the new forecast of $4.5 billion to $5 billion or has there been any change to the scale or the scope of either Phase I or the second phase initiative into Massachusetts?","Rich Kinder","No, there really hasn\u2019t. We just kind of refined the costs and got it to a more likely area of what we think the spin would actually be in the $4.5 billion to $5 billion as a result of that, kind of pinning down where we think the real construction will come out. ","Actually the rerouting would be an increased cost as part of that, something in that same range, but would be a net increase, because we have a few models of pipe. But on the other hand we would avoid most of the section 97 land in Massachusetts and just be largely along the utility write away. But we are still looking at that and we\u2019re in the midst of doing that.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then last question from me Steve, regarding CO2, if you could, could you quantify what that current Midland-to-Cushing differential could have on annual cash flow if it stayed at this level. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea for the sensitivity for every dollar per barrel moving that spread.","Steven Kean","Yes, I don\u2019t really have a sensitivity for you for that. I can tell you that we\u2019ve been actively putting hedges on for 2015 at levels that are, call it $4 better than what your seeing in the current market right now.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Rich Kinder","Thank you Darren.","Operator","Next is Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Thanks.","Rich Kinder","Hi, how are you doing?","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Very good. Thanks Rich and congrats Kim. A couple of quick ones here; does the $2 billion effect of quarterly increase in your gross backlog favorably impact I believe your just over 9% combined enterprise EBITDA, five-year tagger (ph) through 2020 that was noted in your S1. I\u2019m just trying to see what\u2019s baked in that and where do we start getting incremental?","Rich Kinder","Kim.","Kim Dang","No, I think that backlog is \u2013 we actually still have some unidentified in that five year plan. Obviously that eats away at that, but it\u2019s not going to be incremental at this point to the 9% growth.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. Once we start getting through the backlog that was included in that guidance, if you guys can give us a heads up at anything new that is incremental, that would be great.","Kim Dang","Sure.","Rich Kinder","We\u2019ll do that.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","And can you provide some more color around the continued growth in SACROC. You kind of referred to it, but not much detail and also the Yates NGL flooding time set and the latest ROZ updates. ","Rich Kinder","I\u2019ll turn that over to Jim Wuerth. He runs our CO2 operation. Jim?","Jim Wuerth","Yes, in SACROC I guess three main areas that we\u2019ve had real good success with the horizontal wells that we are using as the injectors of CO2, we are getting good response from those. So the bypass wells that we kind of talked about in the past, it looked like that\u2019s going to be a real good outcome for SACROC, so that\u2019s one. ","Two, with the seismic we have, initially I think we said we\u2019d have about five or six pinch out wells that we\u2019d be able to identify in infields and drill. We drilled 22 of those now. I think those are running about 1,100 barrels a day higher than we had anticipated. We have several more of those identified as the seismic prophecy continues to get better. ","The other area I think just (inaudible) infields, we\u2019ve done a couple of those. We\u2019ve been very encouraged with that, with one of them starting out close to 700 barrels a day. Back early in the year still producing 400 barrels a day. The second one coming on is over 400 barrels a day, so a lot of opportunities there. ","We continue to look at fringe areas. We know we got few more programs out there that are up in the platform where we\u2019ll add on some there and around some differences around the, both the east and the west side of SACROC. So just continue that opportunities at SACROC that we are finding there and I think we\u2019ll continue to find more as we go forward. ","At Yates on the hydrocarbon municipal we had \u2013 the good and the bad news there is we thought we\u2019d have a test, putting some NGLs down into the gas cap in the third quarter. The problem we had is we needed a baseline and we got the first well we picked. The first oil there we are producing, its currently still producing about 350 barrels a day on it. ","So what that has done its opened up another opportunity for us to look at this purchased oil and we are doing that. We are taking some wells in there and actually perping and picking up some of those purchased oil. So I guess its a great opportunity there. ","I think now we have identified a couple of wells where the well bore integrity is really good. We think we can get the base line fairly quickly. We hope to do the injection of the NGLs in the fourth quarter. ","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","We will see some results coming in. ","Rich Kinder","On the ROZ, I\u2019d like to continue on the ROZ. We have 10 other wells drilled at this point in time, facilities that are going in. We would still expect bringing the actually injection a little bit forward. We are hopping to start injecting by November 15 and we\u2019d have all in production facilities up and running to go by late December. They will handle any gas or fluid that come out the other side. So we would expect to see some results on this by the end of first quarter 2015. ","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay, and the final results here on the NGL flooding. Is that a first half event? ","Rich Kinder","On the NGL flooding we have not even had a chance to flood it yet. That\u2019s why I said that will be fourth quarter in this year. ","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","","John Edward with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","","Hey John, how are you doing? ","","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","Good afternoon Rich. Doing well and I also want to say congrats to Kim as well. So just \u2013 maybe I missed it, but what\u2019s your sort of range, your total shadow backlog right now? ","Rich Kinder","Well, I think Steve said when you get into the shadow backlog John, its very difficult to identify it, but I think the number he said was $15 billion to $17 billion. ","Steve Kean","Yes, that was just the projects that I mentioned. A different way of looking at it is if you look in the gas group alone its $18 billion. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve calculated or identified a specific one for each of the other business units though John, so I mean its got to be 20 plus, but we haven\u2019t articulated that.","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","Okay. So $18 billion in the gas group alone, but the $15 billion to $17 billion\u2026 ","Steve Kean","That included some of the gas projects John. So, I mean if you wanted to look at $18 billion in gas and then look at the non-gas projects, that would be another $1.1 billion or so, 88s on the Palmetto project and then the Y-Grade project is, call it a little over $3 billion. And again, those are 88s numbers. Don\u2019t take into account if we ended up \u2013 we don\u2019t have one today, but if we ended up with JV Partners on those. ","So that\u2019s another $4 billion-plus on top on Tom\u2019s $18 billion and that\u2019s just in the products group and we haven\u2019t \u2013 again, we have not gone out and calculated and compiled a shadow backlog for Terminals for example or even full done one for products. So we kind of sum it up. The prospects are very good and we\u2019ll go knock these things down when they get in front of us and go from there. ","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","So if I add that, I could characterize it as a round number, something like call it $20 billion to $24 billion of shadow. ","Steve Kean","I mean I would say north of $20 billion you know. I don\u2019t know how far north, okay. ","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","All right, just kind of helps us to think about that. And then so, I mean you sort of answered this earlier, but so in light of all the volatility in the market, you are not really seeing anybody. You are not really seeing this impact, your discussions on potential projects or impact interest in terms of yield future going forward. You are not really seeing any delays or deferrals or anything like that given the market volatility. ","Rich Kinder","We are not seeing that thus far. ","Steve Kean","And to Rich\u2019s point earlier, it doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t see some of that on the producer side, some harder hit producers maybe. But lower prices are going to be very bullish for the demand side, which is where we still have \u2013 we have to see the full needs come to market to sign up for the firm, transport and storage commitments that they are going to need to serve in. ","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And as far as when you consolidate close and everything, the guidance that you\u2019ve put out there is basically 16% dividend growth in 2015, 10% thereafter and I think you premised that on just roughly $3.5 billion spend per year. So assuming some of these shadow projects become a reality, so that effectively you are saying there is potentially upside to those numbers, is that a fair characterization? ","Kim Dang","The $3.6 billion per year did not include Trans Mountain. You got to add that on to get to your total. ","Rich Kinder","But I think you can see from all these projects John, that\u2019s why we are comfortable with thinking that that level of capital expenditure, which is pretty consistent as well with anything is certainly attainable and if anything you know that as I said in the beginning of my remarks, we\u2019re seeing some of the opportunities (inaudible) infrastructure are better than they \u2013 they keep getting better. ","Now I think Steve and Tom and I have all said, we can\u2019t predict the future and there maybe some impact on particularly some of the smaller producers. We have not seen that yet, but certainly we think the demand is going to be the big driver in the future and they actually improve as a result of lower prices, if indeed the prices stay low and certainly what we saw in the natural gas side. ","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","Okay. And then just lastly sir, and you\u2019re still thinking sort of 5 to 5.5 times leverage for the consolidated entity; I mean at least for 2020 or so that\u2019s still the plan. ","Rich Kinder","Yes. ","John Edward - Credit Suisse ","Okay, great. That\u2019s all I had, thank you very much. ","Rich Kinder","Thank you John. ","Operator","Next question is from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is open. ","Rich Kinder","Hi Becca, how are you? ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","I\u2019m good, thank you. Better this afternoon than I have been in the last couple of days. Can you talk about just on \u2013 back on Trans Mountain, The Burnaby issues and the latest route to tunnel under the mountain and the delays; does it have any impact on the cost estimate at this point? ","Rich Kinder","Ian Anderson, President of Kinder Morgan Canada is in the room, Ian. ","Ian Anderson","Yes, no Bec, its not going to have a material cost impact from the overall project whatsoever. A little bit more spending up front to do the assessment of the geology of the mountain, but its not significant. ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Great, thank you. And then there\u2019s been an amazing number of new pipeline announcements just in the last six months and when we look at the last build out cycle we had in \u201908, \u201909 there was a lot of cost over runs. How are you guys planning differently in this cycle given kind of what we went through in the last time in a number of announcements. ","Rich Kinder","Yes, now that\u2019s a very good question Becca. I think first of all we are looking very, very carefully at our cost in terms of escalation, both of materials, but more importantly putting into our estimate adequate cost escalation of a labor side. I think that\u2019s extremely important. ","If you look across our business units right now, on all the projects we are working on, Steve kind of alluded to this, actually products on all the projects that they are working on is actually running about 1.5% below the original estimates. Natural gas is right on. CO2 is right on and the only place we\u2019ve had overruns is on Terminals, primarily some of our Canada projects and that\u2019s between 6% to 7% over run. So we have not seen any dramatic issues thus far. ","The second thing that\u2019s important about just really watching and getting your estimates right is trying to get a sharing mechanism with your shippers on some of the more inflation prone areas. For example, on the Trans Mountain we have some sharing arrangements on construction costs in the lower Mainland, this Burnaby would be an example of that. ","We have some sharing costs on the cost of First Nations involvement and that\u2019s what we are trying to build in in various projects. There is nothing perfect here and its something that I think is going to be a challenge to the industry and the industry is going to have to watch it very, very carefully. ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Can you say what escalators you have built in?","Rich Kinder","It varies with the project and specifically with the geographic location. Obviously you build in the higher escalators in geographic areas where you don\u2019t have access to as many competitors in a particular subcontracting area. So it varies all over the longer part, but we think we are building in adequate incremental numbers as we go forward. ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Thanks and then the last question is just on this SFPP settlement. Does this finally put to bed all of this long-standing litigation? ","Rich Kinder","It does we think. It has to be approved by the CPUC. They fast-tracked it and we expect it will be approved, but obviously it has to be approved by the commission. ","Yes, it does, and in fact we have a three-year moratorium on rates on the SFPP system on the CPUC portion of the intra-state portion. So yes, we think that does put it to bed and as we said in the press release, I think we detailed, the details out really. ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","So we can take 10 pages out of the 10-K then. ","Rich Kinder","I certainly hope so Becca; that\u2019s a good catch. ","Becca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors","Right. Thank you. ","Rich Kinder","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you and our last question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Rich Kinder","Hi Jeremy, how are you? ","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan","Hi, great and my congratulations as well to Kim. At the risk of getting ahead of myself a bit here, I was just wondering if you could provide us kind of an M&N wish list in terms of what areas of midstream you\u2019d like to expand into. ","Well, I guess the question is it seems on the Nat Gas Pipeline side, I imagine you might run-up into antitrust considerations. I\u2019m just wondering what are the parts of midstream you might want to spend in more. Just any color that you\u2019d be willing to share would be great. ","Rich Kinder","I think the color we would be willing to share is we are looking at all realistic opportunities across the spectrum in all of the businesses that we are in. ","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan","That makes sense. Fair enough. Figured I\u2019d try, thanks. ","Rich Kinder","Okay, well that looks like that\u2019s the last question. Thank you all very much and have a good evening and we appreciate you spending the last hour and a half with us. ","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","And now, I'd like to hand the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Mr. Kinder, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Carrie, and welcome to our first quarter analyst call. As always, before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements, and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","I will kick this off by making a few remarks, then I will turn it over to Steve Kean, our CEO, and Kim Dang, our CFO, to give the operational and financial update, and then we will take any questions that you have.","I want to quickly make two points. First of all, this quarter's good results in terms of EBITDA and DCF which Steve and Kim will discuss in detail, demonstrates once more the strength of the asset portfolio at KMI. We are able to generate substantial amounts of cash flow even in a challenging environment in our business. Sometimes, good solid financial and operational success, which is made possible only by a lot of hard work by the whole team, gets overlooked by some investors. But I would argue that it's one of the critical elements to the long term economic health of any entity, and that includes Kinder Morgan.","The second point I want to make is, that Steve will update you in detail on this quarter's developments on our Elba and Trans Mountain projects, but let me say, we continue to make good progress on them, and on our goal of strengthening our balance sheet and thereby allowing us to return substantial value to our shareholders, through some combination of dividend increases, share repurchases, additional attractive growth projects, our further debt reduction.","Now, as I have said previously, we currently believe the best avenue for returning value, is by an increased and well covered dividend, and we expect to announce our revised dividend guidance for 2018 later this year.","And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, thanks. I will give you a few updates on our performance and our key projects. First, we had a very good first quarter, with DCF per share at $0.54, and that's better than our beginning of the year guidance. Right now, we are seeing that and calling that as timing, so we are still forecasting to be on plan for the full year. But overall, strong performance for the quarter.","On our Trans Mountain project, we have made progress on the project itself, and also on our effort to either joint venture the project with a partner or to include it in an IPO. On the project, we reached a really significant milestone. We increased our cost estimate, and that increase put us above the contractual cap. So cap was C$6.8 billion and our revised estimate is C$7.42 billion, and that, being above the cap, gave our shippers the right to turn capacity back to us.","At the investor conference in January, we expressed our confidence that the market still had a very strong need for the project. And in fact, when all was said and done, all 708,000 barrels remained under long term contract. But now, have the increased tolls, and those increased tolls include our return on the additional capital that we will spend.","We ended up with only 3% of the barrels turned back, and those were taken up in an open season over the course of a week or a week and a half. The contracts are 15, but primarily 20 year terms -- predominantly 20 year terms. Now this is a remarkable development, when you consider that these contracts were signed five years ago, and at $90 a barrel oil environment, and when the Canadian and the U.S. dollars were at parity. A lot has changed since then, including the circumstances of many of the producers in the oilsands, as well as the project costs itself.","Our shippers and our commercial team worked very hard and fast to place the barrels with new customers, and existing customers who wanted more. As those who wanted less looked for places to assign our capacity. So message here is that even at the higher cost the demand for the project remained strong, and that's huge. We have essentially reconfirmed the value and need for the project, with a 2017 line-up of shipper needs, and based on 2017 market conditions.","We also received during the quarter, our environmental approval from British Columbia, and we now have written agreements on the satisfaction of the B.C. five conditions, which were put forward for heavy oil pipelines crossing the province. So good regulatory development, and an extremely good commercial development as well.","So that's on the project. On the JV, our IPO front, we have advanced on both tracks simultaneously, which is what we told you we would do in January. We believe this approach provides the best opportunity for us to secure acceptable financing terms for the project. Our key considerations here are value and control of project governance. Both of these processes are well advanced and we expect to update you by the end of the quarter on the resolution. Recall that for our plan, we assume the JV partner picking up 50% of the capital, but we did not include anything for our promote payment, which we would expect to get, and coming up with our target 5.4 debt-to-EBITDA metric. So in other words, we could do better on that target, to the extent we get to promote that we expect to get.","I know everyone is interested in what the value is going to be, but we have avoided putting a marker out there for the sake of maintaining a strong negotiation position, but I will say this, this is an attractive return project, and is consistent with the 6.7X EBITDA multiple average that we have for the backlog as a whole.","As we announced earlier, we completed our Elba JV transaction in the first quarter, and it was at the value that we put in the plan for 2017, and that included value in excess of our capital spend, recognizing the value that we created in originating the project.","On the backlog, I will be brief, this quarter it stands at $11.7 billion, $300 million lower than last quarter. As usual, there are multiple moving parts, small project additions and removables and some cost changes, but the main development is that we placed into service our Kinder Morgan export terminal, a liquids terminal dock and cross channel line project for one of our refinery customers on the ship channel, the Houston ship channel. ","We expect to update the backlog for the Trans Mountain outcome next quarter, so the project cost will now be approximately $5.7 billion, and the ownership level is of course, expected to change.","One more project update before moving to a few commercial highlights. On our Utopia pipeline project, our project team has done an excellent job of acquiring right of way, and finding routing alternatives where necessary in the wake of an adverse court decision last year on eminent domain in one of the Ohio circuit courts. We are pleased with our progress, and we -- again we began the tree felling process in the first quarter. This joint venture project is under a long term contract and is expected to be in service in January of next year.","Now a few commercial market updates, starting with the gas segment. Experienced slightly increased transmission volumes year-over-year, but gathering volumes were down. I will start with gathering; we are generally seeing a leveling off of volumes in our key basins during the first quarter, but the comparison to first quarter last year reflects the declines that took place throughout 2016. Generally, our volumes are in line with what is observed in the basins in which we operate, although we are running a little bit ahead in our Bakken's gas assets, with one exception, and that's the Haynesville, where we are down on our KinderHawk asset, where the basin is flat to slightly higher. That's a function of the fact that our primary customer was not active in 2016. That's beginning to change, and we have added a new customer, that's actively developing its acreage, so we expect some improvement there.","Recall, that our gas segment is 55% of our segment. Earnings before DD&A and gathering, processing is only 18% of that number. On the transmission volumes, we are up 1% year-over-year. The winter was weak, it was weak last year too, but we had a cold March in 2016. Power demand was down year-over-year. What I have read predicts that gas will still exceed coal's share of the power market again this year, but some gas to coal switching did occur on our assets in the first quarter. Also we saw higher renewable, including California hydropower contributing to the year-over-year decline.","Overcoming this though, were exports to Mexico, which were up 16% year-over-year on our systems and now averaging 2.8 BCF a day -- averaging 2.8 BCF a day for the first quarter. Recall, that the vast majority of our margin here is secured by reservation fees, which are not affected by usage, but the volume information helps give a view on long term value for the capacity. I failed to mention also that LNG exports were up on our system year-over-year by half a BCF a day.","We signed up an additional 400 a day of long term firm transportation commitments in the quarter. A 100 of that was existing but previously unsold capacity that brings our total in the last three and a quarter years to 8.4 BCF of new sign up of which 2.2 BCF is existing previously unsold capacity. ","We recently announced two developments related to the Permian. First, we announced a non-binding open season for a 1.7 BCF newbuild pipeline from the WAHA hub in West Texas to Agua Dulce in South Texas, our Gulf Coast express project. Last week, DCP announced its potential participation in that project as a partner and a shipper, and we are working with them over the next 90 days or so, to try to finalize that arrangement. ","DCP's assets in the Permian would provide good upstream connectivity and our Texas intrastate network would provide excellent downstream connectivity to Mexico, LNG at Corpus Christi and utility in industrial markets along the Texas Gulf Coast. Gas production is growing in the Permian and increasingly, East Texas is becoming a premium market. We think the project makes a good deal of sense, but we are in the early days and we have not put it in the backlog.","The second development related to the Permian is, we have a binding open season on our EPNG system for capacity to the WAHA. The open season package includes 150 a day of existing capacity, but it also reflects our ability to expand the system, by as much as 900 days more, to meet incremental demand. The expansions would be relatively inexpensive, and would again, demonstrate the value of having existing infrastructure that we can build off of at attractive returns. This project with a fee takeaway capacity at WAHA, including the potential Gulf Coast express pipeline in our Midstream business, and we continue to work both of those opportunities over the coming weeks.","The overall summary on gas is that we continue to expect long term benefit in the sector from increased LNG, Mexico exports, power and industrial demand, which should drive the demand from transportation storage infrastructure for the long term.","Shifting to our products segment, refined products volumes are up 1% year-over-year, even though we experienced some weakness in Southeast U.S. markets. Crude and condensate transportation volumes are also up 1% year-over-year, notwithstanding declines year-over-year in the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins. KMCC in particular continues to show the benefit of its superior connectivity, both on the supply end and the Eagle Ford, as well as on the [indiscernible] in the Greater Houston area, and holding up very well in the face of declines experienced in the Eagle Ford as a whole on a year-over-year basis.","In our terminals business, our liquids terminals utilization climbed to over 95%, as we continue to benefit from the strong positions we have built in several liquid hub locations. And this team has been gradually been migrating it's business increasingly to the liquids part of the business. We are now at 80% of our segment earnings before DD&A coming from the liquids part of the business, and increasingly, our development activity is in the hub positions that we have built in Houston, Edmonton, New York and Chicago over the years.","We have kept our Jones Act vessels under charter on renewals that we have experienced, on [indiscernible] renewals. We had the discount to do that, but we expect to be slightly ahead of our plan on this business, and we currently have all of our vessels under charter. We continue to make good progress in our base line terminal expansion at our Edmonton hub, and as I mentioned, we put our Kinder Morgan export terminal project in service on the Houston ship channel.","In the CO2 business, we came in slightly ahead of plan for the quarter, with pricing offsetting lower crude production volumes. Also of notice, that we achieved record CO2 volumes during the first quarter. Our demand was up, but so were our third parties'. They had a good strong demand for CO2 off of our system.","So again, overall, a strong quarter, with strong financial performance, continued progress on our project execution and on our joint venture plans for our key projects.","And with that, I will turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Good. Thanks Steve. Today, we are declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, which is consistent with our budget. On the performance, let me hit the high points first, and then I will take you through the details. I will start with the GAAP numbers, and then move to DCF. DCF is the way we look at and think about our numbers and performance.","Earnings per share attributable to common stockholders is up 50% in the quarter. Now, it would be nice to take credit for a 50% increase, but I don't think that gives us an accurate -- that's not an accurate view of the way we perceive our performance. Adjusted earnings per share, which we have added for you on the GAAP income statement and adjusted for certain items, is about $0.01 a share. DCF per share, which is the primary way we judge our performance, is down 1% or $18 million versus the first quarter of 2016, all of which is attributable to the sale of a 50% interest in SNG. So after the sale, DCF per share would be flat. For the first quarter, the DCF per share of $0.54 is slightly better than our budget, and for the full year we remain on target to generate $1.99 of DCF per share.","On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA consistent to where we ended 2016, but a significant improvement versus the 5.6 times in the first quarter of 2016.","Now for the details, looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, let me point out a couple of things to you there. You will see that revenues are up about 7% in the quarter, but cost of sales is up by more, resulting in about $121 million reduction in gross margin. Adjusting for certain items, gross margin would actually be down slightly more, would be down $146 million. The largest contributor to this decrease is the 50% sale of SNG. As a result of that sale, we no longer consolidate SNG's revenue and cost of sales, but report our 50% in net income further down the income statement as equity earnings.","Now keep in mind also, that SNG did not have significant cost of sale. The impact of deconsolidating SNG was approximately $145 million reduction in gross margin for the quarter. Therefore, excluding the sale, gross margin would essentially be flat, which is consistent with how we would view our results.","Net income available for the common shareholders is $401 million or $0.18 a share versus $276 million of income or $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in $125 million or $0.06 per share increase or 45% and 50% respectively. Net income available to common shareholders before certain items for adjusted earnings was $371 million or $0.17 a share versus the adjusted number in 2016 of $402 million or $0.18 a share.","Certain items in the first quarter of this year are income of $30 million, the largest of which is associated with proceeds we received from the sale of a bankruptcy claim on one of our natural gas pipeline. Certain items in the first quarter of 2016 were net expense of $132, driven primarily by project write-off and impairments.","Now let's turn to the second page of financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and the year and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. As I said earlier, DCF is the primary financial measure, on which we judge our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.215 billion versus $1.233 billion for the comparable period in 2016, down $18 million or 1%. There are lots of moving parts, but the simple explanation I gave you earlier is true, which is after the sales of 50% interest in SNG that occurred in the third quarter of 2016, we would be flat.","Segment EBITDA before certain items is down $90 million, when you look up at the segment. That's primarily due to $113 million reduction in our natural gas segment. Of the $113 million reduction, $83 million is attributable to the SNG sale, and the natural gas decline is partially offset by $26 million increase in our terminal segment, which is associated with expansion projects coming online in the marine division and in the Gulf Coast. G&A and interest are a benefit of $44 million in the quarter versus the first quarter of 2016, both largely as a result of the SNG transaction.","In our adjustments to convert net income to DCF, we add back JV DD&A and subtract sustaining CapEx to more closely reflect the cash we expect to receive from our JV; because SNG is a JV in the first quarter of 2017 versus the fully consolidated asset in the first quarter of 2016, there is approximately a $17 million benefit between the two periods in our adjustment from net income to DCF to reflect the economic impact of the SNG JV. So a $90 million of reduction in the segment. You add back the $17 million benefit to reflect the economic impact of the SNG transaction. The $44 million reduction between interest and G&A expense, and that gives you a net reduction of DCF of $29 million, which largely reconciles the change of $18 million in DCF.","DCF per share was $0.54 versus $0.55 in the first quarter of the prior year or down a penny, almost all of which is associated with the DCF [indiscernible] I just walked you through.","This $0.54 in DCF results in $935 million of excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter. As I said earlier, for the quarter, we are ahead of budget, but for the full year, we expect to be on budget, largely as a result of some timing associated with sustaining CapEx, interest and cash taxes that occur in the second, third and fourth quarter.","And with that, I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, as I said, we ended the quarter at 5.3 times net debt-to-EBITDA consistent with where we ended 2016. Our budget for 2017 is that we would expect to end 2017 at 5.4 times debt-to-EBITDA. After the first quarter performance, we are still on track to achieve that. Remember, as Steve said, the budget nor the current forecast, include any proceeds from a Trans Mountain promote, which we would expect to receive, and therefore, we would expect that our actual result will improve on the 5.4 times budget and forecast.","Now reconciled before you, we ended the quarter at $37.8 billion of net debt, that's a $317 million decrease from the end of 2016. We generated DCF of $1.215 billion. We had expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments of $773 million. We have asset sales and JV proceeds of $462 million, the largest of which was $391 million that we received from the Elba JV. We paid dividends of $280 million, and then we have working capital and other items, at a little bit over $300 million. So working capital is what we would expect in the first quarter. In the first quarter, we typically see working capital associated with interest payments, because we have a large portion of interest payments which occur in the first quarter, and so interest was a use of cash of $165 million in the quarter. We pay a significant amount or property tax in the first quarter, that was a use of cash of $77 million and then bonuses get paid in the first quarter and that was a use of cash about $75 million. So those were the three primary uses of cash in the $300 million of working capital.","So with that, Steve, Rich?","Rich Kinder","Okay. Carrie, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Kristina Kazarian of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Kristina, how are you?","Kristina Kazarian","Good afternoon guys. How are you doing?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Kristina Kazarian","All right. So can you guys tell me a little more about how you are thinking about the new Permian project particularly the gas takeaway pipe? You know, how the DCP deal came about? And if you are also willing, maybe project cost and any updates on the open season?","Steve Kean","Yeah. So I will start with the open season. It's closing shortly again, it's non-binding. The DCP discussion started early, even before our announcement of the deal that continued up until -- well that will be continuing on. But widened enough that we did a joint announcement of their participation. And again, the rationale there is, we get upstream connectivity with their processing assets and pipes in the Permian. And then we have downstream connectivity from all the market that we connect to, on what we think is the best intrastate system in Texas, connected to LNG, Mexico, et cetera.","You know we are -- I think there is enthusiasm for it, but again it's non-binding. Producers I think are increasingly turning their attention to finding additional routes out of the Permian. Sometimes that takes some time to ripen. But certainly, there is interest in it, and will also cultivate interest on the demand side as well.","And on the demand side, one of the things that we can do and have talked to people about is, we are a buyer of gas in Texas, because we have a lot of sales gas customers in the state of Texas, and so one of the things we could do, is buy the inlet to this piece of pipe, and that may serve as a bit of a bridge for some of the producer markets out there.","So any parts of your question I have missed?","Kristina Kazarian","Project cost?","Steve Kean","Cost. Yeah, we haven't come out with cost yet. But I mean, it is a 1.7 BCF newbuild project. So you are looking at north of $1 billion.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect. And then my next question is, we have seen a good bump in Eagle Ford rig count recently; can you maybe talk about how this is trending, versus your original expectations and any chance for a positive revision related to this?","Tom Martin","Yeah I mean -- it's going I think as we expect with the price recovery that we have seen. So I think, generally, what we are seeing in the basin, is a bottoming out of volume, both crude and gas, really this quarter, trending flat to slightly up, starting next quarter, and then probably finishing the year higher than it is today. And that's kind of where we set our plan coming into the year, and I think generally, that's how we are seeing it play out. Maybe slightly more activity than we were anticipating to this point. But I think how all that materializes, as far as actually bringing volume online versus just drilling, you know, that still needs to be played out over the year.","Steve Kean","Yeah. I think we build as we started. We ended the year kind of where we started with some declines early and then picking up. I think, some developments that have been encouraging, is the rig count has been up a good bit. The other thing is, and these are related, is that acreage has been changing hands down there. So it's going from people who were not actively developing to people who are actively developing, and that's a positive indication for the basin too.","Kristina Kazarian","And Steve, last real quick one for me, as I know you said end of Q2 for timing and then, still waiting on FID and arranging project financing, but any other color you want to give, maybe for what we should be waiting for?","Steve Kean","No. Those are the key things really. I mean, we are running both of these processes simultaneously. And the reason for doing that of course, is to get to a value point that reflects a fully negotiated deal or a fully marketed process and it's not fully marketed or fully negotiated until it's done. And so, we are not there yet and so we haven't [indiscernible] yet.","Kristina Kazarian","Got it. Nice job on the quarter guys. Thank you.","Rich Kinder","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Brandon, how are you?","Brandon Blossman","I am good. How are you Rich?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Brandon Blossman","Let's see, probably just a couple follow-ups on Kristina's questions. One, on Gulf Coast express; Steve, you talked quickly about some projects on El Paso, I think, on the inlet side of that pipe. So I was wondering one, if you could describe in a little bit more detail, what those projects would look like? Are we talking about reversing compressor stations or adding compression or both? And then, more detail on the downstream side of that pipe; clearly, there is a way to get volumes up and down the Texas Gulf Coast, but any comments on -- is there anything that needs to be done to that intrastate system, or is there just plenty of unutilized capacity there?","Steve Kean","Okay. Yeah so, the open season on El Paso has 150 a day of capacity that's existing, that comes in a bit over time, as the contract rolls off. But that's 150 without moving a muscle. We have got that capacity available and we can do it today. We can get another 900 of expansion, and the first, if you want to think of it this way, the first half of that roughly is relatively small CapEx. It's back pressure valves and things like that, that we probably do on a -- and a few pipe modifications. I mean, the interstation modifications, and we can probably do that under our blanket certificate, could do that relatively quickly, and that's a nice pickup. And again, underscores the value of having piped an inactive basin that we can make some adjustments to.","The second half of that expansion, to get up to that 900 a day of incremental, would require compression. So that's a little bit pricier, but again, not much. There is not significant, little bit of pipeline built on maybe, but it's not a significant investment, but that would require a 7c.","In terms of getting -- once you get to Texas, gas will be flowing south and east primarily, east to Corpus and south to Mexico. We are expanding that network with a crossover expansion that we have got in service, and we put in service in September of last year. So we have got -- and it is a network. So you have got options there, and it doesn't cost as much to expand that as needed for takeaway. But my guess is, and Tom you can opine, there may be some expansions -- if people who want to take significant volumes to Houston, we may need some expansion.","Tom Martin","Yes. [They go 1.7] [ph] on the Houston.","Steve Kean","That will be a problem. We will be happy to have that problem, but --","Tom Martin","Short of that, I mean, there is a lot of -- really just changing the direction of the flow. I mean, we [indiscernible] today and a fair amount of that going to serve Mexico, some of that market today. So just letting that volume stay, and then actually we can pump some of that -- I mean, originally, these facilities were constructed to move gas from South Texas to Houston. So we have that capability today.","Steve Kean","And the other takeaway -- there is other takeaway. When you get to WAHA, that's a significant hub and there is significant capacity coming online from WAHA to Mexico. So that's the other value adding component of the EPNG projects.","Rich Kinder","I think once again, we have said over the years, how valuable it is to have the huge footprint that we have, particularly on the natural gas side, and this is just one more indicator of how valuable that is. The project is not done yet. The open season has concluded. But the fact of having all that pipe in the ground is of enormous advantage, when you start talking about expansions and extensions of your system.","Brandon Blossman","Great color. And then I will probably just follow-on on that topic. Competitive environment, we have three pipes essentially, very similar [indiscernible] announced in the same time period. So one, just what the competitive landscape looks like that, vis-\u00e0-vis producer interest? And then related, is there any chance of moving around the project, if there is demand and interest, say earlier 2019 or even late in 2018, is there something that can be done more quickly, in order to satisfy some residue gas takeaway issues?","Steve Kean","Well, it's an intrastate project, so it's not a federal process. So if the demand is there, and it's there in a hurry, we can move more quickly. Yeah, it is a competitive environment, but I feel like, we have got the best downstream connectivity here, and we touch all the major markets, including all the big growing markets, and I think that's a real advantage. I mean, Agua Dulce -- getting to Agua Dulce didn't use to be a very big deal, you were just in South Texas. If you are in Agua Dulce and connected to our system, and you can go to Mexico or you can go to Corpus Christi or you can go to Houston, then you have really got something.","Now, we need to -- we are working to sell for the upstream piece, and that's where DCP, I think, is a very nice fit. But there are others out there too, who we could coordinate with, to make sure that we can get the gas to WAHA and of course, EPNG expansion fits very nicely with that.","So we think we have got a very good offering. I am sure that the other competitors would say the same thing, but I think that you look at the upstream and the downstream and we have got a very nice offering.","Tom Martin","And one thing I would add Steve is, we are reducing interest from some of our customers in the intrastate network, actually wanting to reach back potentially all the way to WAHA. So again, I think that's something we offer in our project that our competitors don't.","Steve Kean","Plus, we'd like to buy some of the gas.","Brandon Blossman","All right. Perfect. Thank you very much guys.","Steve Kean","Thank you, Brandon.","Operator","Our next question is from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Shneur. Good afternoon.","Shneur Gershuni","Good afternoon guys. Maybe just to start off following up to some of the questions with respect to the Permian Gulf Coast express; with respect to that project, with DCP potentially being on the project, how far away are you from getting to a commitment level that you would feel comfortable moving forward with the project, as it gets you 'fairly close?' And then secondly, when we think about project returns, I know that the board has sort of been enforcing a mid-teens type of return hurdle, is that something that you would need for this project to proceed to just given the contracted nature, it looks like with this -- you would be willing to accept the lower return hurdle to move forward with the project?","Steve Kean","It's early to be talking about that. We have got a non-binding open season that's closing, and I think while the shipper interest, certainly producer interests, this is a maturing situation, as they are looking at takeaway capacity out of the Permian in their own production. And so I think, frankly, we are ways off there, in terms of maturing or ripening the project. I think we have got a good offering. I think DCP can bring volumes to themselves. We can bring purchase requirements to it. I think there are a lot of things that are compelling about it. But I think we are ways off.","Now on returns, we have been using as a starting point, 15% unlevered after-tax returns and in projects where we are building off of our network, we have been pretty effective at getting those kinds of returns. And this has some of those characteristics, when you look at the downstream network and you look at upstream potentially on EPNG. On the other hand, where we have secure cash flows under long term contracts with good credits, we certainly talked with our business unit presidents about don't say no to those, if they are just -- because they are just a point or two off, bring them to us, let's have a look at them and see if on a risk adjusted basis, we are comfortable with them. So it's not a hard and fast, it's a totality of the circumstances kind of a valuation.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And just pivoting to TMX for a second here; you have the federal B.C. approvals in hand, but there is a lot of job owning in the upcoming B.C. elections about TMX's well too. I guess kind of two questions, one, what avenues would new government have in British Columbia to interfere with a project? And then again secondly, does the discussion with any JV partners or -- is it potentially suspended until after the election result is in, or the discussions continuing and ongoing, and it doesn't really influence the start?","Steve Kean","I will go with the last question first. So no, there is no suspension of any process. We are going full speed ahead on both processes here. On the B.C. election, as you pointed out, we do have our federal and also, our provincial approval, and that includes the EA and then also the environmental approval. And it also includes, reaching agreement with British Columbia on benefits of their five conditions, which are primarily, benefits to BC, as well as risk reduction associated with marine and land response. There are also many other benefits of this project to British Columbia, that we think are recognized, and think and hope would be taking into account, for creating a lot of B.C. jobs here. There is economic development. There is benefits to the First Nations and the communities along the route that we have entered into a mutual benefits agreements with. And we have got a lot of detailed plans and protections that we put in place, and that the British Columbia and federal governments have put in place, to mitigate any perceived risk from the project.","Now we are -- also, this is a federally sanctioned project. Now we are watching, we are certainly following developments very closely, and the B.C. -- the government in B.C. can certainly have an impact on the project, but it's probably a little premature for us to pine [ph] on those exact impacts at this point. We have a lot of momentum on both the federal and the provincial level from all the work that we have done and that those governments have done to address the concerns that have been raised, and to make sure that there are benefits that are shared with the broader public. So we think we have got good strong support behind us, both at the federal and the provincial level.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And one final question; last quarter, you talked about green shoots potentially emerging. Q1 seem to have some momentum in it as well too. But you sort of didn't change your yearend leverage target, and so forth. Are you seeing these green shoots develop? Could we see -- exceed your leverage targets by the end of the year or rather EBITDA targets? I was wondering if you can sort of comment on what you are seeing in terms of flows in green shoot?","Steve Kean","Yeah, again, we are not changing our outlook and notwithstanding the strong first quarter performance, we are not changing our outlook for the full year. In terms of the debt-to-EBITDA metric changing, I think the main mover there is probably getting the financial arrangements in place for the Trans Mountain project. We are just a few weeks into the second quarter here, and I think there are some promising developments there. The rig count is one thing we have mentioned. Our Haynesville producer becoming more active on the gathering part of it. We are happy to be up 1% year-over-year on crude and condensate and refined products volumes. But it's just a little early for us to calling anything different on our EBITDA at this point.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Afternoon Ted.","Ted Durbin","Hey Rich. How are you doing?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Ted Durbin","So I guess, just thinking about the JV and the promote on TMX and what you just announced on Elba a little while back, is there -- are those terms that you sort of came to on Elba? Breathe through for us, in terms of [indiscernible] about Trans Mountain. But from your perspective and in the way a potential partner might think about the investment in Trans Mountain?","Steve Kean","Yeah. I don't think so. They are very different projects. As I said, the Trans Mountain return is consistent with the average return -- the overall return in our back -- the overall multiple of EBITDA in our backlog, which is about 6.7 times. So they are not -- they are really very -- they are very different projects, and so, I don't think you can analogize much, except to say, that we got compensated for the work that we did in originating and developing the project at Elba, and we expect -- as we did on Utopia, and we'd expect the same to be true on Trans Mountain.","Kim Dang","The construction, when you look at how those projects are built, the construction is different. You know, you are going to take longer to construct Trans Mountain, than it takes to construct Elba. Elba is a self-contained site, with a signed EPC contract. In Trans Mountain we have multiple trucks over many miles. So the projects just have different returns and different risk profiles, and so I would expect that investors -- potential JV partners would take all those things into account. So I don't think you can take an Elba and apply it to Trans Mountain.","Rich Kinder","That's right. I would add, that of course what we have on both projects is very strong long term contracts with creditworthy entities, and I think, we just can't overemphasize on Trans Mountain, the fact that we have all these shippers who were signed up for 708,000 barrels a day, almost all of them for 20 years, and that is a very important factor, just [indiscernible] signed up on Elba, for that period.","Ted Durbin","Great. And then, I know this came up a lot at Analyst Day, but just a thought that -- you know, if you can't come to terms that you think are attractive for a JV partner and to promoting the things that you'd like to see. Let's say if the election goes south on you next month. I mean, you are still willing to walk away from the process or an IPO and are you willing to self-build the entire project, or would you then move to just the IPO process? Just where you are headed on all that?","Steve Kean","Yeah. I think that's not a decision we are confronting yet. We fully expect that the two track process is going to produce successful results for us, so that's what we are basing our decision making on right now.","Ted Durbin","Okay. Fair enough. And then if I can do one more smaller one; the two section 5 rate cases that you got hit with currently in the year. Just how much of an annual revenue impact would you see from those, if -- well let's say, the pipelines will return, we will call it a reasonable ROE, as the FERC see that, what would be the revenue impact there?","Steve Kean","Well first I will say, we feel very strongly that it was not appropriate to initiate those proceedings, because not all of the facts around those assets were fully taken into account in the section five process. We are also in discussions with our customers right now, and we did not expect that the -- anything other than -- at most, a de minimis impact on the margin for those assets.","Ted Durbin","Okay, perfect. I will leave it at that. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon Jean Ann.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Hi, good afternoon. If you look at adding to your backlog. Should we think of the DCP JV as an indicator of broader interest than getting into the Permian in a bigger way? Or is it just opportunistic, since you already had existing gas assets? You had sort of continued to focus on building out existing basin [indiscernible]?","Steve Kean","No, we would like to -- we have existing assets that serve the Permian. EPNG of course, we have the line on the Texas intrastate, so that line is fully utilized and constrained and difficult to expand. So we are already there, and we are absolutely looking to expand our presence there. I should have mentioned too, NGPL serves the Permian and brings the gas northbound to Chicago, and their opportunities on that system as well, to take advantage of the developments there.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Great. And then, I don't think that this is victory, but can you just give a sense of how much of your backlog is waiting for quorum to move forward?","Steve Kean","I think, Tom correct me on this. We got orders on the projects that were time critical already, before the quorum disappeared early in the year. And so now, I think where we are is, we are not going to find the time critical issue, so long as they get quorum by midyear, thereabouts or even late 2017. So it's not constraining us right now, Jean Ann.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. Great. That's all for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks. Most of my questions have been asked, but I had a couple of follow-up questions on TMX. Within the B.C. agreement that you signed earlier this month, I think you stipulated the June end decision timeline followed by a July 2nd announcement. Is that the absolute latest we will hear something, or can you announce something prior to that?","Steve Kean","Yeah. That was really to set a date that was out there, kind of at the end of the timing thinking. So it was just a negotiated date, and it was put out there to be kind of at the end of the timing.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. So we could hear something earlier than that?","Steve Kean","Possible.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. Secondly, within that agreement, is there any protection that you have from this potential change in political regime in the province?","Steve Kean","Something in the agreement?","Danilo Juvane","Right. Meaning, if there is a change, politically, [indiscernible]. Does the agreement change in any way, shape or form?","Steve Kean","No, the agreement doesn't change. No, the agreement does not change.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. Got you. Last but not least, just a clean-up [ph] question for me; what was the CO2 CapEx for the quarter?","Kim Dang","$112 million.","Danilo Juvane","Got it. Thank you. That's it for me.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hey John. How are you doing?","John Edwards","Good Rich. Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here; just on the real strong export volumes on Mexico this quarter, and what kind of growth rate is expected for the rest of the year, in terms of export volumes to Mexico?","Steve Kean","Tom, do you have a feel for that?","Tom Martin","That's a tough one. I mean, I think, it really just depends on the timing of additional capacity coming online. I am not sure I could give you a number. I mean, we should be trending up from here, but not out of [indiscernible]. There is a very steep climb. I think it will just continue to fully grow.","John Edwards","Okay. And then, just on the dividend. I know -- any more thoughts on, kind of step it up high with a slower growth or step it up not as much and grow it fast? Any kind of preliminary thoughts on dividend policy?","Rich Kinder","Oh, we are going to step it up high and grow it fast. Just kidding John. Look, we are going to have more say on that later in the year. But as we emphasize consistently, we are going to have the firepower, we believe, to significantly raise the dividend. And when we do, we are going to make sure that we -- that dividend is strongly covered. And one way of looking at it is, we'd like to be able, in an ordinary year, to be able to fund the equity portion of our expansion CapEx out of the cash flow, which would lead to good coverage of whatever dividend we are paying. But we haven't made any detailed decisions on it. And again, as we promised, we are going to do that later this year and get back to you with our outlook for 2018.","John Edwards","Okay, great. And then just one other question on Trans Mountain, you may not be able to comment on this, but in terms of the timing of the payment -- I know at Analyst Day, if I recall correctly, there was a discussion about having a good chunk of the amount be paid upfront versus -- over the construction process. Any other datapoints or color you can provide on that?","Steve Kean","That's still consistent with our expectation?","John Edwards","Which one, Steve?","Steve Kean","The upfront, giving a significant portion of the proceeds upfront.","John Edwards","Paid upfront. All right. That's helpful. Thank you. That's it for me.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, John.","Operator","Our next question is from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Good evening Darren.","Darren Horowitz","Good afternoon Rich. Hope you and everybody is doing well. Steve, just a quick question for you on Gulf Coast Express; when we put all the pieces of the puzzle together, of the 1.7 that's being marketed, inclusive of the reside gas that DCP could commit, and we can all see what that is, and the options both upstream and downstream at the pipe that you talked about. Based on what you are marketing, how much total capacity do you think is necessary to commercialize the project? And then, as you mentioned, it makes a world of sense to be a buyer of that gas, especially if they can come back and capitalize on some regional [indiscernible], so how much capacity would you want to just leave open for that opportunity?","Steve Kean","Yeah, very early to tell. Again, Darren, it would be -- if the demand is there at a high enough rate, you wouldn't have to fill the whole pipe. Tom, our purchase business is over 1 BCF a day, that's the whole portfolio, right?","Tom Martin","Probably 2.5.","Steve Kean","2.5 BCF a day and Eagle Ford is declining. So it would be a nice -- at an attractive price, a nice way to fill in for that, and the purchase part of portfolio, the Texas intrastate. Too early to tell what that mix will be.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. Do you have a sense -- and this is my follow-up, and I will leave it here. Do you have a sense when you look at what's being marketed out of the basin, relative to residue gas, with high growth expectations? Either yours or from third parties. Do you have a sense of how much takeaway capacity is actually going to be necessary?","Tom Martin","I mean, I think at least [indiscernible] in some analysis we'd see [ph] two additional pipes. So definitely enough to build this project.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Jeremy. How are you?","Jeremy Tonet","Good. Good afternoon. Thanks. Going back to TMX for a second here, I was just wondering if you could remind us, if you guys had kind of finalized, whether or not the JV and IPO process, whether that would include existing assets, or is it just the project itself? Could you just walk us through your way of thinking there?","Steve Kean","Yeah. So it's very difficult to -- really, it's effectively impossible to break the expansion from the existing Trans Mountain system. It's effectively a twinning of that system, with some blind reactivations in it, and common facilities at the terminals and at the dock. So really the way we would be selling this, either at JV or an IPO is with the existing system as well. And in the IPO, potentially with a broader offering of our Canadian assets as well.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Thanks. And just one more, as far as Gulf Express there, and congratulations on that project, where the open season there. Was just curious as far as the interplay between kind of new projects and kind of returning a dividend to a higher level in the interplay, because I assume, 2018 CapEx steps down somewhat from 2017 and that kind of helps you in the process of being able to lift the dividend. And so it's a great thing to win new projects, but then, you know, you see the interplay there, as far as the leverage is concerned. So just wondering if you could walk us through your thoughts there?","Steve Kean","I think it goes back to what Rich said earlier. We would look to have enough coverage over our dividend to be able to continue to fund the equity portion of a growth capital plan. So we are looking at -- we are going to be looking at all of that, as we come up with our guidance to the latter part of this year -- in the latter part of this year.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Michael, how are you?","Michael Blum","Good, thanks. Just two quick follow-ups on Trans Mountain, on the JV IPO. Just what is the latest in terms of timing? In terms of when you think you will have an announcement? And then second question, would FID come sort of concurrent with that, or is that running on some sort of separate track? Thanks.","Steve Kean","The timing is this quarter, and we haven't been more specific than that Michael. We are running both processes simultaneously, and again, the point there is, that we want to get ourselves to a fully negotiated JV side or fully marketed on the IPO side to kind of see what our value is. We would expect that the FID would come close in time, with the conclusion of those processes.","Michael Blum","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We show no further questions at this time, speakers.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you very much, Carrie. Thanks for all of you participating in our call and we will talk later.","Operator","Thank you.

Before making any investment decisions we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial statements, and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings releases, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC and the Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","Let me begin the call by saying that at the end of 2015 we made a very difficult decision to reduce our dividend for the first and only time in KMI's history. We said we would work hard to strengthen our balance sheet and fund our growth CapEx from our internally generated cash flow without having to issue equity or additional debt. And that when we had made sufficient progress on those goals, we would begin to return additional value to our shareholders through some combination of dividend increases and\/or stock repurchases.","Since that time, we have reduced our debt by approximately $5.8 billion and funded all of our CapEx out of operating cash flow while paying a dividend of $0.50 per share per year. Today we are happy to announce multiple steps to return significant value to our shareholders. We plan to increase our dividend for 2018 by 60% from the current level of $0.50 per year to $0.80 per year beginning with the dividend payable for Q1 of 2018. We then expect to continue to increase the dividend by 25% per year '19 and '20, resulting in a dividend of $1.19 and $1.25 in 2020.","Additionally, our board today authorized a $2 billion share buyback program also expected to begin in 2018. We intend to take these steps while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet by funding all our growth capital needs at KMI out of operating cash flow without the need to issue equity or incur additional debt. We expect to maintain best in class coverage for our dividend, for example about 2.5 times coverage in '18 and two times or better in '19 and '20.","To sum up, we intend to fund our growth CapEx needs at KMI from internally generated cash flow and return excess cash to our shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Well, that\u2019s the big announcement. I am going to take you through KMI performance highlights and then turn it over to Kim Dang, KMI's CFO, to take you through the financials. Following that, I will update you on KML and turn it over to Dax Sanders, CFO of KML, to give you the KML financial update, and then we will take your questions on both KMI and KML.","So starting with KMI. We had a good second quarter and a good first half of year. Performance was a little better than planned for the quarter and the first half of the year. As we said on the first quarter call, recalling that timing and expect to be essentially flat to plan for the year after adjusting for the impact of the IPO of 30% of all of our Canadian pipelines and terminals assets as a result of the IPO. Also, we have now completed the two key steps that we outlined at the beginning of the year to strengthen our balance sheet and put us in a position to return value to shareholders as Rich told you.","Number one, we completed that JV of our Elba Island liquefaction project in the first quarter. That was consistent with our budget assumptions. And in this quarter we secured acceptable financing for our Trans Mountain expansion project. With those steps now complete, we project to end 2017 with a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.2 times versus the 5.4 we projected at the beginning of the year. It's worth noting a couple of things from the KMI perspective on KML.","By creating an entity with all of Kinder Morgan's existing Canadian assets and taking that entity public, we established a business that is broader than the expansion project. These assets include our existing pipeline and terminals asset networks in Canada, including what we believe is the best merchant terminal position in the Edmonton hub. The Edmonton position is a network with facilities interconnected with each other and with Trans Mountain and third party pipelines. We continue to expand that network with our base line terminal project which I will get into in the KML portion.","The Canadian pipelines and terminals businesses produced a little under $400 million of EBITDA Canadian, in 2016. The strength of this business and it's opportunity to grow further creates an entity that can raise its own capital for the $6.1 billion in remaining spend on the expansion. In fact, we closed shortly after the IPO on a construction credit facility that Dax is going to take you through in a bit.","So we were able to strengthen KMI'S balance sheet using the IPO proceeds to pay down debt, secure an acceptable means of funding our largest expansion capital project which will benefit both KMI and KML shareholders alike. Now a few KMI business segments performance highlights for the quarter.","First, the backlog currently stands at $12.2 billion. That\u2019s an increase from last quarter. We had new project additions in gas and CO2 which outpaced projects that were placed in service primarily in the terminals segment. We continue building out this backlog which we expect will contribute significant EBITDA to the segments when complete. Overall project management performance has also been quite good, delivering results that are consistent with our investment decisions.","We are also, and I would say especially in natural gas, seeing additional opportunities on the horizon across multiple fronts, whether it's producer push projects out of the Permian, additional power plant connections, export needs to Mexico and LNG as well storage opportunities. In our natural gas segment, we saw transport volumes increase year-over-year, Q2 to Q2, by 3%. Key contributors were Mexico exports which were up 8% year-over-year, higher LNG exports coming off of our pipes, and partially offset by lower power demand.","On the other hand, our gas gathering volumes were down year-over-year by 12%. Gathered gas volumes were up in Bakken but down in both Eagle Ford and Haynesville, and overall we are seeing volumes flattening to slightly recovering in our key basins. Recall that our gas segment is 55% of our segment earnings before DD&A and gathering and processing is only 18% of that number.","We signed an additional 280 a day of long term firm transport agreements in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date increment to 680 a day and our total sign up of the last three and half years to 8.7 Bcf a day of which 2.4 Bcf was existing previously unsold capacity showing again that the rise of natural gas production and demand creates expansion opportunities but also adds value to the existing network.","We continue to make good progress on our 1.8 Bcf a day Gulf Coast Express proposed project which goes from the Permian to a connection at Agua Dulce in South Texas with our existing Texas Intrastates system. We are not putting it in our backlog at this point but we have got a good offering to the market and we are progressing our commercial discussions towards firm commitments.","We also continue to see interest in our Permian capacity on EPNG which has some very economics that is low capital, expansion opportunities to get more gas to Waha. The overall summary on gas is that we continue to expect long term benefit in this sector from increased LNG and Mexico exports, power and industrial demand and those should continue to drive the demand for the transportation and storage infrastructure that we own.","Shifting over to our products pipeline segment. Refined products volumes, NGLs and crude and condensate transport volumes were all up year-over-year. The benefits of these higher volumes were offset by some settlements, the project write-off on Plantation and the sale of our interest in Parkway pipeline last year, all of which weigh in to leave us slightly down year-over-year on the segment's earnings before DD&A basis.","Getting back to the volumes. Refined products volumes were up 2.2% year-over-year versus an EIA overall market growth number for April and May of 1.5%. NGL volumes are up 14% year-over-year. And in contrast to our gathered volumes, our crude and condensate transport volumes are up year-over-year on our Eagle Ford that is our KMCC asset and our Bakken pipe. Bakken performance is due in part to the delay of DAPL, the KMCC volumes I think are an indicator of the great connectivity and superior location of that system.","We have made excellent progress during the quarter on our Utopia pipeline project. Recall that we receive an adverse decision on eminent domain in one of the Ohio circuit courts last year. Our team did an excellent job of acquiring the necessary right of way, including reroutes and the purchase of an existing pipeline. And so in the quarter we finished acquiring all of the required right of way and we are now about one third complete on pipeline construction and on target for our scheduled January 1, 2018 in service. Really fine work and fine recovery by the project team on Utopia and, again, scheduled to be on time on January 1, 2018.","In our terminals business, the segment earnings before DD&A were up 2% versus Q2 last year primarily as a result of contributions from projects coming on line in our liquids business which makes up about 80% of this segment. Our leasable capacity in liquids was up 2%, our utilization remained very strong at 95%. Both volumes were also up year-over-year. 4.7%, which was led by performance in pet coke and steel. Our commercial team wisely remained aggressive in keeping all of our Jones Act vessels under charter and discounting as necessary to do so. And we have all of those vessels under charter today and took delivery of two during the quarter. One at the very end of the previous quarter and one during the quarter.","In CO2 we experienced a lower effective oil price compared to last year and lower oil volumes but we are on plan in this segment. We experienced record CO2 production in April and higher volumes year-over-year for the quarter Q2 this year to Q2 last year. We are also seeing promising results from our recent [indiscernible] activation programs at Sacroc, and from our Tall Cotton Residual Oil Zone development which is now producing over 2000 barrels a day. ","So overall, a strong quarter. Strong financial performance. Continued progress on our project execution. Completion of a key milestone in our effort to strengthen our balance sheet and position us to return value to shareholders. And with that I will turn it over to Kim Dang.","Kim Dang","Thanks, Steve. We are declaring a dividend today of 12.5 cents per share consistent with our budget. On the performance let me hit the high points first and then I will take you through the details. I will start with the GAAP numbers and then I will move to DCF, which is the way that we look at and think about the numbers and performance.","Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share are both flat versus the second quarter of 2016. DCF per share which is the primary way we judge our performance, is a penny lower versus the second quarter of 2016, or approximately $28 million, primarily attributable to the sale of 50% of SNG, the KML IPO transaction in which we sold a 30% interest in our Canadian assets, as well as higher sustaining CapEx and cash taxes.","For the second quarter and year-to-date DCF per share is ahead of our budget but that\u2019s largely timing with sustaining CapEx being the largest contributor. For the full year, after the impact of the KML IPO, we would expect DCF to be on budget. Taking the impact of the KML IPO into account, we expect DCF to be less than 1% below budget. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 5.1 times debt to EBITDA, down from 5.3 at the end of last year and at the end of the first quarter as a result of paying down debt with the approximately $1.25 billion in net proceeds that we received from the KML IPO.","Our debt balance for the second quarter came in lower than what we expected, primarily because some expansion CapEx got shifted from the first half of the year to the second half of the year. Therefore, we still expect to end the year at 5.2 times as we previously communicated. On the expansion CapEx front, we are forecasting $3.1 billion for the year. That is down from our budget of $3.2 billion. The $3.1 billion does not include any KML CapEx, including spending on Trans Mountain from June forward as we expect KML to be a self funding entity. Because of the equity that KMI has contributed to fund the Trans Mountain project prior to the IPO, KML has the capacity to draw on a construction facility to fund its CapEx for the balance of the year.","If you take a broader view, the Trans Mountain expansion has $6.1 billion in remaining spend. It's got a $4 billion revolver and so there is about $2.1 billion gap and we expect KML to be able to finance the balance itself which Dax will take you through when he walks through KML. Now for some detail.","Looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are up by 7% on the quarter but cost of sales is up by more resulting in $114 million reduction in gross margin. A similar phenomenon to what we saw in the first quarter of this year. The sale of 50% interest in SNG accounts for $112 million or 98% of the [sale] [ph]. Therefore if you exclude the sale, gross margin would be essentially flat which is pretty consistent with how we view our overall results for the quarter. As I said earlier, both earnings per share and adjusting earnings per share are flat for the quarter versus the comparable prior period.","Net income available to common shareholders in quarter was $337 million, or $0.15 per share, versus $333 million, also $0.15 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Net income available to common shareholders before certain items or adjusted earnings, was $304 million or $0.14 per share versus the adjusted number in 2016 of $322 million also $0.14 per share. Certain items in the first quarter of this year were a benefit of $34 million. The most significant was a reserve release on a litigation matter we settled. Certain items in the first quarter of 2016 were net benefit of $8 million.","Now I am going to turn to the second page of financials which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. As I said earlier, DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.022 billion versus $1.05 billion for the comparable period in 2016, down $28 million or 3%. Looking at the breakdown of the quarter-to-quarter change. Segment earnings before DD&A and certain items is down $66 million. Natural gas is the largest driver, down $54 million. The SNG joint venture impact was approximately $73 million in the quarter. So absence the sale, the natural gas segment would be up slightly. Although the SNG transaction overall was dilutive to DCF, the segment impact of $73 million overstates this impact as their benefits reflect in other lines with the primary benefit coming in interest expense as we use the proceeds from that transaction to pay down debt.","CO2 segment is down $8 million or 4%, primarily associated with lower oil production at Sacroc, primarily as we reallocated capital to projects that had higher returns but longer lead times. The terminals and products variances in the quarter are small and largely offset. The Kinder Morgan Canada variance is also small. G&A is a net benefit of $16 million quarter-to-quarter primarily as a result of the SNG sale and lower franchise taxes. Interest expense is a benefit of $43 million in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2016, as a result of the SNG joint venture transaction and the KML IPO as we use the entire net proceeds from both transactions to pay down debt.","Cash taxes and sustaining CapEx are higher by about $30 million versus the second quarter of last year but we expected and budgeted both cash taxes and sustaining CapEx to be higher than last year by even more than the $30 million. So there is some timing on these items between the first half of the year and the second half of the year relative to our budget. Totaling those quarter-to-quarter variances, segment is down $66 million, G&A a benefit of $16 million, interest a benefit of $43 million, and cash and sustaining a combined increase of $30 million, results in a variance of $37 million.","The last piece of the variance relates to SNG. In our adjustments to convert net income to DCF we add back JV DD&A and subtract our sustaining CapEx to more closely reflect the cash we expect to receive from our JV. Because SNG is a JV in the second quarter of 2017 versus fully consolidated asset in the second quarter of 2016, there is approximately a $10 million benefit to JV DD&A between the two periods. The net impact of KML for the period is buried in some of the line items I have discussed because it's small, less than about $5 million when taken into account the interest benefit.","DCF per share was $0.46 versus $0.47 for the first quarter of the prior year, or down a penny, all of which is associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through. The $0.46 per share results in over $740 million of excess distributable cash flow above our 12.5 cent dividend for the quarter and $1.68 billion year-to-date. As I said earlier, for the quarter and year-to-date we are ahead of our budget but for the full year we expect to be on our budget when you exclude the impact of the KML IPO. The effect of the IPO will be seen primarily in two places. One, in net income attributable to non-controlling interest which will reflect an expense for the public's 30% of net income which will be somewhat offset by interest expense which will reflect a benefit as we use the IPO proceeds to pay down debt. Including the impact of the KML IPO, we expect DCF to be less than 1% below budget. And with that I will move to the balance sheet.","We ended the quarter with net debt of $36.6 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.1 times. Debt is down year-to-date $1.56 billion and it is down in the quarter $1.24 billion. To reconcile that for you, in the quarter it is pretty easy, we are down $1.24 billion of debt and the IPO proceeds were $1.25 billion. So essentially everything else nets out but to take you through some of the details, DCF was $1.022 billion as I previously mentioned. Investments, our investment programs, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investment was a little over $875 million. We paid dividend of $280 million and then we have working capital and other items of $129 million. Source of working capital which was primarily associated with accrued interest as most of our interest payments are made in the first and third quarters.","Year-to-date we have reduced debt by $1.56 billion and so to break that down for you. We generated DCF of $2.24 billion. We had $1.64 billion in investing activity between expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We received $1.25 billion in IPO proceeds. We had a little over $450 million from asset sales in JV proceeds, primarily the Elba promote. Our partner's catch up of its equity contributions and the sale of some of our non-core terminals. We paid dividends of $560 million and we have working capital and other items that were a use of capital of $178 million, which were a whole host of items that include use of cash for inventory, primarily natural gas purchases. Property tax payments, a lot of which occurred in the first quarter. Debt issuance cost associated with the KML construction facility and accrued interest. So with that I will turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Now we are going to turn to KML. I will give the update and then Dax will take you through the numbers and also couple of key updates. So just a reminder, KML consists of all of the Kinder Morgan Canadian pipelines and terminals assets. So those include our existing Trans Mountain Pipeline system which runs for and is the only outlet for Alberta crude to a world oil market price. It also includes of course, the Canadian $7.4 billion expansion to triple the capacity of that system. KML also includes the Puget Sound system which takes oil from the Trans Mountain Pipeline and delivers it to Northwest Washington State refinery. A market that we would expect to grow over time.","KML includes the Canadian portion of the Cochin system which delivers condensate to Alberta for blending with the oil sands crude for transport. Crude comes down from the oil sands to our merchant terminal position in Edmonton, among other places, where it can move down Trans Mountain or third party pipeline, or through one of our joint venture crude by rail facilities. We have built our Edmonton position over the last ten years and continue to expand it with our Base Line Terminal joint venture with Keyera, which is the Canadian $366 million investment to our share. That\u2019s on time and on budget with the first tanks coming on line in January of 2018.","Finally, Vancouver Wharves, our multi-commodity bulk terminal in Vancouver harbor and the Gateway terminal for mineral concentrates both coming into and out of Western Canada is also part of KML. So in all, KML is comprised of two strong, existing business platforms that are integral to fulfilling the transportation, blending and storage needs of producers and refiners. They have substantial upside associated with Trans Mountain expansion as well as other potential expansion. On the Trans Mountain project, I will remind you that in Q1 we reached a significant milestone. We increased our cost estimate about the contractual cap. The cap was $6.8 billion Canadian and our revised estimate is 7.42. That gave our shippers the right to turn back capacity. At the investor conference in January we expressed our confidence in the market need for the project and in fact when all was said and done, all 708,000 barrels remain under long-term contract. But now with the increase told, which includes return on the additional capital spend as well, we ended up with only 3% of the barrels turn back and those were taken up in an open season. The contracts are predominantly 20 years with one 15-year contract.","So we had essentially reconfirmed the value and need for the project with a 2017 line up of shipper needs based on 2017 market conditions including oil sands condition. Also recall that we have built in protections for the costs that are more difficult for us to estimate and control on the project. These uncapped costs associated with, among other things, the most difficult mountain and difficult urban portions of the build, if higher than shown in our cost estimate result in an adjustment to our total which includes not only recover of the cost but also the project return on those costs incurred. By the same token reduced costs flow through to the benefit of our shippers and our shippers benefit from the fact that other portions of our cost are capped. And we would absorb the overrun there, if any.","We also received our environmental approval for British Columbia earlier in the year and of course our federal government approval finding that the project is in the public interest of Canada. So in the quarter we made our final investment decision of approving the project. We made a public offering that included all of Kinder Morgan's Canadian assets and we secured financing. As we are moving into project execution, we are finalizing rates with contractors, we are ordering materials, readying for construction start in September. And we are doing that with substations first nations support, support from the federal government on a project of vital national interest, support from the Alberta government and with our BC environmental order in hand, and with significant financing sources already secured. And with that I will turn it over to Dax.","Dax Sanders","Thanks, Steve. Before I get into the results and outlook, I want to highlight a couple of occurrences on the bank capital markets project. First, we received our initial ratings from the agencies and consistent with our expectation we received a rating of BBB from S&P and BBB high from BBRS. On the financing front, as Steve mentioned, we closed on a financing package that consists of $4 billion base facility, a $1 billion contingent facility, and a $500 million working capital facility. All of which positions us well to access the significant portion of the capital we need to build the Trans Mountain project including accessing the Canadian pref market as we discussed on the road show.","As I move in to review of the results, I want to preface my comments with the caveat that while I will be offering quarter-over-quarter comparisons, those comparisons are of limited value at this point given that we are reporting a quarter where KML was owned by the public for a part of the quarter and will be compared to a quarter where it was wholly owned by KMI and during those periods part of the IPO there were shareholders loans in place that generate significant effect, most of which is unrealized interest and other items not reflective of the true earnings power of KML. Therefore, we would ask you to focus on the outlook for 2017 which you will see is consistent with what we discussed on the road show.","Quarter-over-quarter variances will mean over time and obviously we don\u2019t have a published budget for KML as a standalone company but starting with our budget cycle this year we will published one just as KMI does. Now moving to the results and outlook for 2017.","Today we are announcing that the KML board has declared a dividend for the second quarter and an inaugural dividend for KML of $0.0571 per restricted voting share which corresponds to pro rata percentage of the $0.65 annualized we suggested on the road show, adjusted for the 32 days in the second quarter that KML went public. With respect to performance and as Kim did with KMI, I am going to walk you through summary items and then will provide incremental details starting with the GAAP numbers and moving on to DCF, which is the metric we believe is most reflective of performance.","With respect to earnings and net income, earnings per restricted voting share is $0.11 for the quarter which is derived from $25 million of net income which is down from approximately $52 million of net income for the same quarter in 2016. Adjusted earnings which adjusts for certain items is $36 million compared to $46 million for the same quarter in 2016. With respect to DCF, DCF per restricted voting share was $0.083 for the quarter which is derived from total DCF for the quarter of approximately $79 million versus $86 million for the comparable period in 2016, down $7 million or approximately 8%. That provides coverage of approximately $2.8 million and reflects a payout ratio of approximately 69%, again consistent with what we talked about on the road show.","Now moving to the detail. Looking at the preliminary GAAP income statement, I want to point out the unusual item that is driving almost $27 million decrease. FX moved from a gain of $5.8 million to a loss of $16 million. That $21.8 million swing was mostly related to the revaluation of the intercompany loan between KMI and KML that were repaid at the consummation of the IPO, again consist with the message on the road show. And the items that drove $18.5 million of that $21.8 million, were classified as certain item. The remaining 3.3 of the swing not attributable to certain items and included in the variances for net income, EBITDA and DCF, was largely attributable to the settlement of intercompany AR and AP between KMI and KML and the revaluation of U.S. dollar bank accounts at KML.","Going forward, while there may be some unrealized FX associated with intercompany AR and AP, now that KML is a standalone public company, those items will be settled on a monthly basis and unrealized FX should be much less. Now let's turn to the second page of the financials. Those are DCF and is reconciled for our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. Segment EBDA before certain items was $10 million compared to Q2 2016 with the pipeline segment down approximately $11 million and the terminals segment up about a million. The largest pieces in the pipeline segment was timing and integrity expend at Cochin, OpEx at Trans Mountain and lower revenue on Puget.","At the terminals segment, we had higher Vancouver Wharves throughput and revenue offset by higher O&M at Vancouver Wharves. G&A is essentially flat. Interest cost is $4.4 million lower versus Q2 2016, primarily as a result of the repayment of the intercompany loans and greater capitalized interest associated with the project. Total certain items for the quarter were $10.5 million tax affected, with the largest piece being the intercompany FX that I mentioned. The remaining 1.3 is related to certain JV IPO costs that were booked to the Canadian business, prior to the IPO. Both cash taxes and sustaining capital were essentially flat compared to the same quarter in 2016.","Now moving on to some specifics for the full year 2017. We expect EBITDA for the full year 2017 including pre and post-IPO periods to be just under $400 million and we expect DCF to come in at approximately $320 million. Both of those are consistent with the $395 million and $318 million of 2016 EBITDA respectively that we highlighted during the IPO.","One item to highlight. You will recall that we recognized equity ADC as part of both EBITDA and DCF which is a product of how much CapEx we spend on the project. So EBITDA and DCF will be affected by the amount and not end timing spend on the project. With that I will move on to a few short comments on the balance sheet. From the end of the year to June 30, cash increased approximately $35 million which is mainly due to a draw on the construction debt and working capital facility that I mentioned. Other assets increased $290 million which are primarily attributable to CapEx spending. On the right hand side on the balance sheet, debt decreased by almost $1.2 billion and that was a result of paying off the intercompany loan.","As of June 30, KML had total debt of $189 million which was attributable to $190 million drawn on the construction and working capital facility. And with that I will turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. We are ready to take questions on both KMI and KML.","Rich Kinder","Natalie, if you will go ahead, we will take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jean Ann Salisbury","So now that the IPO is now behind you, I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the contract process that you are wondering -- sorry, that you are running. And how you decided on the IPO and anything in hindsight that you would have done differently or maybe just communicated differently?","Steve Kean","No. We were, I think very clear in that we were pursuing both projects simultaneously and we were maintaining a certain amount of competitive tension as a result. So we fully prosecuted both processes simultaneously. I think the considerations around the IPO that were attractive were project governance. I mean you can only have one driver of the car when you are executing on a project of this magnitude. Certainly we viewed the value proposition as good. We thought that by combining all of our Canadian assets into one entity, we are creating a very attractive prospect for the market and had the ability to self fund the capital needs of the entity going forward.","So, overall, it made sense for us to do the IPO and that\u2019s the result we ended with.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And could you just give a little more color on why you decided to do this between the share buyback and the dividend raise. I know you had many trajectories that you could have followed.","Steve Kean","Yes. So we think that we are generating cash that\u2019s in excess, that\u2019s surplus. So it's in excess of our needs for our capital projects while we are building them out and so we see the room to return essentially all of that excess cash to shareholders. And which shows a significant dividend increase. I think that\u2019s a very positive for shareholders, but also a share repurchase which is kind of unique in our sector that gives us the ability to be opportunistic when we see an opportunity to purchase -- to return value to shareholders through a share repurchase rather than locking it all in on the dividend increase. So we think it's a good mix of ways to return capital to shareholders, return value to shareholders. Substantially growing dividends, still very well covered, extremely well covered as Rich pointed out, with a buyback program as the backstop which gives us some flexibility to take advantage of opportunity.","Rich Kinder","And I would add that opportunistic purchases of shares is certainly something we would be interested in, particularly since right now our share to DCF ratio is about five turns below our peer group average. So we think that\u2019s mispriced in that sense.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co. Your line is now open.","Brandon Blossman","Sounds like a pretty good day on your side of the call. So, I guess, let's start with KML. A decent equity currency there. Clearly there is a little bit of equity funding to come but maybe it's too early and not a fair question, but where do you see that entity ultimately going to in terms of public float, size? What kind of strategic things could you do with that particular entity over time?","Dax Sanders","Yes. So first in terms of the public. We do not intent as KMI to sell down additional shares from our interest. But the entity may do primary offerings to help raise the capital needed to fund its expansion. We also talked about on the road that it is a good currency and there are opportunities on the M&A front that we would like to consider. And we will do that. Those are very hard to predict or to call, or forecast, as you know. But we think there are some good opportunities out there and we like a lot of the assets that we see in Western Canada. So I think it is a good currency. We think it will help us raise capital and also maybe an acquisition currency.","Brandon Blossman","Got it. Nice answer. More detailed question. Gulf Coast Express, what is the timeline to getting that into the backlog as you see it today?","Steve Kean","Yes. As I said, we are trying to ripen some very strong interest into firm agreement. We think that that is a matter of weeks to months in order to get that done. Again, we think we are making a very good offering to the market out there. We provide good takeaway capacity from Waha into South Texas where it connects with our intrastate system which we are very proud of. It reaches all the key markets that I think producers will be looking for takeaway. Houston ship channel is now a premium market in the gas market and that\u2019s driven by the fact that we have got LNG, power gen, pet chem development and Mexico demand. That pulls very hard on our system. And so we think we have a very fine offering and there is a strong degree of interest in it but we are not counting it until we got them all in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shneur Gershuni","Just a couple of quick follow up questions. Just for starting off with Jean's question about the buyback versus the dividend. I guess kind of -- I was wondering how much did the current stock price and your current multiple relative to peers play into the decision to shoot for a buyback. And then I was wondering if you can comment about the duration or the expectation of how long it will take you to execute the buyback. Is it something we should think as ratably over three years or something that you would like to achieve sooner than that?","Rich Kinder","Well, I think first of all what we have given you is an outline of the future for the time period '18,'19 and '20. So I think you can expect it over those three years. Obviously, we will be opportunistic in the way that we utilize those funds for stock repurchases. But we think this is a very strong combination of having a dividend increase that is substantial, 60% next year and 25% in two years after that. Together with some fire power reserve for opportunistically buying back our own stock. While at the same time, funding all of our expansion CapEx with internally generated funds. And you know that really does two things. It keeps a very nice ratio of coverage of the dividend which I think is important. And, secondly, it continually improves the balance sheet because we are using our own internally generated funds to produce assets that will generate more EBITDA. So I think it's a win-win all the way around the horn and that\u2019s our reasoning process.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. Good answer. And as a follow up question with respect to Gulf Coast Express. I know there is a lot of interest in the open seas and from your prepared comments 2019 sort of seems to be the target. Do you sense if that can potentially be brought up sooner than that, just given the level of interest? And any sense on how much would it cost, kind of like an estimate per mile that we should be thinking about.","Steve Kean","We are in a competitive situation and we are not giving you our cost estimates for reasons I am sure you understand. I think, look producer timing is a little bit different. It varies from one to another and there are some shippers who are more in a hurry than others. And because we are talking about a Texas intrastate build not a FERC certificate build, we may be able to accommodate earlier in service states for those customers who are in a bigger hurry. At least giving them to some market outlet. And so we are definitely in discussions about how we can go about doing that. And having it as a Texas intrastate project gives the flexibility to do that that we wouldn\u2019t have in an interstate natural gas pipeline project.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And just two little housekeeping questions. On TMX, is there sign offs you need from BC to keep the construction date on schedule, and do you have the CO2 spend for the quarter?","Steve Kean","You want to give the CO2 spend first?","Kim Dang","Sure. CO2 spend for the quarter was 118 million including our overhead allocation.","Steve Kean","Okay. And Ian Anderson, President of KML is here and he can answer your question on BC.","Ian Anderson","Yes. On BC, as you know we have got our primary environmental certificate from BC, we got earlier this year. And we continue to need a good number of local permits from British Columbia and Alberta for that matter as they relate to crossings, road crossings, utility access, crown lands etcetera. And those permits are continuing to be advanced and filed and work continues on them with British Columbia and with Alberta in line with our construction schedule that will have us commence in September.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ted Durbin","Just following up on that last question. I guess, we do have a new government and it does seem that they are opposed, it sounds like, to TMX expansion. I guess how are you going to navigate some of the objections that have been brought up by this new government. What road blocks or obstacles might we need to watch for as you move forward into construction.","Steve Kean","Yes. Ted, as we said, the permitting process is ongoing. It's continuing to progress and we feel comfortable with that in line with our construction plan. I am not going to speculate on what an NEP government might do in British Columbia at this stage in order to advance their views. We remain very confident in the federal decision that we have and the jurisdiction that the project has federally. I have worked cooperatively with several provincial and federal governments over the years of the development of this project and I want to do the same with Premier Horgan's government. I do look forward to talking to him soon and updating him on the project and our ongoing commitments to engage with communities and first nations as that\u2019s a project that\u2019s in the national interest. So I think we will just wait and see what Premier Horgan wants to do and I look forward to his call.","Ted Durbin","Okay. Great. And then if I can come back to the buyback and not just buyback versus dividend but buyback versus, call it organic growth. I guess would you be buying back shares now given the choice of using your capital there versus sanctioning a new project at, let's just say the average build multiple. Maybe seven times build multiple that you have in backlog right now. How do you think about that choice?","Steve Kean","We think about it in terms of the return for the capital that we are deploying. And we think at the current stock price that is an attractive investment opportunity for us. We have a significant build out which we have already accounted for in our backlog in determining what the surplus cash was and have the flexibility to add additional projects to it. But the commitment we are making is that over and above the cash that we need in order to invest in capital projects, we are going to return essentially all of that to shareholders. It's going to be in the form of a dividend but also in the form of share buybacks where those make sense.","Ted Durbin","Okay. Great. And then one last one and I just wanted to be clear on this. There is a mention of Kinder Morgan Canada being self funding. Does that imply that you will no longer consolidate the debt that you will incur to build TMX or is that still going to come through in terms of your debt to EBITDA calculation.","Kim Dang","No. We will consolidate KML. We will consolidate the EBITDA, we will consolidate the debt. And so that will be in our numbers. What I meant by self funding is, I mean we don\u2019t expect at this point that KMI will have to contribute equity into KML or buy KML's equity. It is another way to say it, in order to help KML fund the expansion project.","Steve Kean","And just to be clear, those numbers starting from $6.1 billion remaining funds necessary to construct were Canadian dollars numbers that Kim was mentioning. So I think she gave you, Ted, a pretty clear path showing how KML really will be self funding.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Darren Horowitz","Congratulations on the enhancements to enhance shareholder value. My first question, Steve, with regard to the Permian gas volumes at Waha in the South Texas, and you all have done a good job outlining this. But can you just give us at least a rough sense of what you think the scale and cost of EPNG capacity expansions could look like and more importantly, how you balance committing capacity on that line versus Gulf Coast Express. Obviously if Gulf Coast Express, at least by our math, gets committed to 1.7 and 1.8 Bcf a day, it's going to be north of a billion dollar project. That\u2019s going to have a different return threshold relative to what you can do on EPNG, again by our math. And then bigger picture, do you think logistically, it's just a situation where the magnitude of downstream demand pull out of Waha could handle both the potential for 1.8 Bcf of commitments on Gulf Coast Express talk with Dulce as well as scaling up EPNG.","Steve Kean","Okay. Good questions. So the key thing to understand is really the expansions on EPNG are really complementary to the Gulf Coast Express project. So the EPNG expansions are about getting gas to Waha and just simplistically I mean what Gulf Cost Express is about is by getting gas away from Waha to the premium market that is now in East Texas. And so they are very complementary. In terms of the capital on EPNG, as I mentioned, we have got some fairly significant volume opportunities, one tranche of which is out in an open season right now and then potentially at subsequent open season. And these numbers like 500 million a day [comp] [ph] on one of the open seasons. And there isn't a significant amount of capital that\u2019s required. So think of things like just being able to direct more gas to Waha by installing back pressure valves and additional meters and the like.","Those are relatively modest capital expenditures and so we think very attractive and, again, very complementary to what we are trying to accomplish on Gulf Coast Express.","Darren Horowitz","As a follow on, Steve, how much of a competitive advantage is it of yours that you guys can help backstop not only the capacity on Gulf Coast Express but also some of these expansions, the complementary expansions on EPNG. Just given the fact that you guys can buy one plus Bcf a day of gas across the system.","Steve Kean","Yes. And we think it gives us an advantage and it is on both ends of this system. As you point out, EPNG has a nice network in the Permian and to the extent we can feed additional gas to Waha, which we believe we can at attractive returns for the small amount of capital that we would spend there, that\u2019s going to help set that, provides a good supply end for Gulf Coast Express. And then on the market end, as I mentioned, we think we have got an excellent Texas Intrastate system that\u2019s tied in with Mexico, LNG, pet chem demand, power demand, Houston ship channel industrial demand, and utility demand in the Greater Houston area. It's a great network with great connectivity. And so Agua Dulce used to kind of be in the middle of nowhere. You can get to Agua Dulce and now you can get to Houston which is all of a sudden really somewhere in terms of value for the gas molecule.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig Shere","You said about no borrowings just for growth CapEx. Was that intended to mean through 2020?","Rich Kinder","Yes.","Craig Shere","Okay. And is that -- do you think that\u2019s long term efficient or are you questioning the size of your growth CapEx.","Rich Kinder","No, look in developing our dividend policy for the next three years which we are unveiling this afternoon, we looked at our expected capital needs from now through 2020, and obviously concluded that we had room to raise the dividend and still fund all of our capital needs internally and we use the excess to buyback share. So that\u2019s all factored in and we anticipate that we will continue to fund all of that growth capital with internally generated funds. I think we sometimes miss on all the noise what a huge consistent generator of cash flow this company really it. And I think what we are talking about this afternoon really demonstrates that when you look at what we are talking about in terms of being able to maintain a significant capital expenditure budget and still increase the dividend and still have some money left over for buying back shares on an opportunistic basis.","Steve Kean","So the other important aspect to that Craig is that it helps us continue with some natural delevering and continue to strengthen the balance sheet. So for the longer term, and we have been saying this for a while, what we are really aiming for is a strong investment grade balance sheet and we expect to see some natural continuing delevering there. We are not done with that. A growing return of value to our shareholders in the form of a growing and well covered dividend and share repurchases, both of which we discussed today, announced today. And then having the continued capacity to fund new capital investments. And so we think that we have struck this right in terms of what's going to create value for our shareholders overall.","Craig Shere","Well, Steve or maybe Kim, if you want to chime in. Do you see at the end of this three year timeframe getting to a point where you don\u2019t really need to worry about enhancing the balance sheet? Maybe it would be more opportune into the next decade to start funding half of growth CapEx for opportunity sets, let's say seven times EBITDA with some low cost debt.","Steve Kean","Yes. Absolutely.","Craig Shere","Well, that sounds good. And then my last follow up. All this kind of is predicated on the ability to sustain long-term new project origination. Can you comment in the quarter about the specifics about the gas pipes and CO2 projects originated and can you opine about the recurring opportunity set to get to that $2.5 billion a year figure. Do you see the EPNG and Gulf Coast Express that you have talked about as kind of indicative of the opportunities in front of you and that there will be more of that over time.","Steve Kean","Yes. So narrowly we have been constantly kind of reallocating capital and adding some capital to CO2 where we see good returning project. In gas we had a project for an LDC customers as well as some gathering and processing CapEx that got added, and what that was offsetting was in the terminals business we had taken delivery of a ship that\u2019s now under charter, has been under charter. So those were the small pieces. But really as I said, you know if you, particularly in gas we are seeing opportunities. Gulf Coast Express is kind of the headline one but we are seeing good opportunities that are being driven by power demand, the need to connect power plants, to some extent by gathering and processing, but also Mexico, and LNG. And so we are seeing the need, I mean natural gas demand and production is growing over the longer term and that\u2019s going to drive some opportunities for us. And we have a great network. And so that means it doesn\u2019t have to be a Greenfield expansion. It could be an expansion off of an existing that is better. It could be an expansion of an existing part of our network where we can potentially gain higher returns. So we are starting to see that, I would say particularly in the natural gas sector.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Tonet","Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on the repurchases. Did you guys say what date that would start and kind of any more color you are willing to provide around what level would make sense to repurchase? Sounds like between current level is about [indiscernible]?","Steve Kean","We announced over the timeframe of 2018 to 2020, and so that\u2019s the time for you over which we are talking. As said earlier, we think our shares are a good investment at current prices and we are looking to return essentially all of our cash in excess of capital needs to our shareholders and with the dividend level we have set today, with the capital opportunities we see today, we believe that\u2019s going to leave a substantial amount of cash that\u2019s available for share repurchase over the period. And then finally we do expect to be opportunistic which means we will be price sensitive in how we do our share repurchases. We haven't set a target price and we are also not just going to be mechanically buying at the market. So those are broad parameters I know but I think we have given a pretty good set of guidance on $2 billion share buyback program over this three year period.","Jeremy Tonet","Great. Thanks for that. And just wanted to follow up on the capital markets. It sounds like you guys don\u2019t need to access equity or debt markets because surplus cash flow is going to cover all your growth CapEx. Would it be fair to say you would only go to the market to something kind of upside materializes and you wanted the capital for that?","Steve Kean","What we are trying to do is position ourselves -- what we have done is position ourselves not to have to access the capital markets, whether that\u2019s debt or equity. You know it's hard to project whether there might be some set of circumstances in which that makes sense to do but what we have done is make sure that we don\u2019t have to.","Kim Dang","And we will be accessing debt markets to refinance maturing debt but what we are talking about here is financial growth CapEx.","Jeremy Tonet","Great. And just one last one. Just wanted to follow up on TMX timeline extension. Just want to see, when is activity really going to pick up for the construction? Have you guys ordered the pipe yet or how should we think about the CapEx outlay that came out there?","Steve Kean","Yes. As far as the construction planning goes, we have initiated our first pipe order. We are finalizing our contracts with our general contractor and I expect those to be finalized sometime between now and middle of August. Construction activity will commence in September, according to plan. We won't have mechanical construction of the pipeline underway until early next year and that was all was the plan, and that\u2019s all in line with the completion date of the end of 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Chris Sighinolfi","Just have a couple of follow ups on some of the topics already hit. I guess to start, the dividend and share repurchase questions. Obviously not trying to pin you to any firm commitment in terms of timing or cadence, but the KMI old dividend increases were nearly a quarterly event. So I am just curious if you are planning to sort of resume that type of cadence or pivot to like an annual step up that a utility company, for example, might do.","Rich Kinder","It's an annual step up. What we are saying is and we said in the release that the increase, for instance, next year is going to be $0.56 to $0.80 that will begin with the first quarter next year. So in other words the dividend that we pay for the first quarter of 2018 will be $0.20 and it will be applied for the year. And then again we would anticipate taking that from $0.80 to a dollar and then a dollar to $1.25 and we would just flatten that out over the year.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. All right. And then I think I understand it but just want to clarify, in terms of the authorization. I guess I am a little bit curious as to how the board determined the magnitude of the share repurchase authorization. It sounds like, but I don\u2019t want to read in if this is not what you intended, it sounds like $2 billion is where the number that you could envision executing or exhausting between 2018 and 2020. Is that the right way to interpret that or was it just a nice round number that we can have out there.","Rich Kinder","Well, it is a nice round number but you have interpreted it correctly. That\u2019s, look we gave a lot of work, hundreds of hours, Kim and her team with input from all of our business segments to develop this on the bottoms up basis. And when it came out with, we stress tested, we looked at it from a lot of different vantage points, and this we thought was the optimum structure and that\u2019s the number that came out in the wash. We will see how all this plays out over those three years but that\u2019s certainly our game plan, as we said, is to take the dividend up and have that amount of money left to buyback shares. And again very importantly, continue to improve the balance sheet because we are funding our capital expenditures out of cash flow.","Chris Sighinolfi","Two additional questions, if I could. Just a clarification on KML side. I guess the point around, obviously the consolidation. So, Kim, just to clarify, your comment about $3.1 billion of expansion CapEx, that was sort of the net to KMI portion but what we should see represented on the cash flow statement is a consolidated figure over time.","Kim Dang","That\u2019s right. So I think in our Q we have put in a CapEx table in there. The CapEx that we are expecting for the year and we are going to break it out between KMI and KML because we will be consolidating KML so that you can see the total consolidated and you can see the KMI only piece.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then related to, Steve -- I think, Steve, that question about KML financing strategy. I know in the S-1 you guys were talking about maybe preps and maybe some distribution recycling. I was just curious, I know you said you are not planning to sell down KMI's interest but do you have any refined guidance as to what you are planning to do with the cash distributions on the KMI's own portion. Does that get recycled at all or is that...?","Kim Dang","Yes on the KMI piece we will probably do 25% of our distribution we will reinvest.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And do we just think about that then, Kim, as you effectively using that to buy additional equity but it keeps the cash on the balance sheet up there to fund the program.","Kim Dang","It's funding the expansion CapEx, yes.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then just final question for me. Does the debt fair value adjustment figure came down precipitously in 2016. It's been hovering around $1.1 billion for the last couple of quarters. Just curious, as you go through the refinancing, as debt maturities come up and you place new debt to replace that, should we see that number continue to drift lower or any guidance as to how we can think about that might be helpful.","Kim Dang","Well, the debt fair value number moves for a number of different reasons. One, as interest rates move, and two, as our credit spreads move. And so if you can, knowing where interest rates are going to go, you have to know where interest rates are going to go and where our credit spreads are going to go to be able to predict what's going to happen with that over time. And so, I mean if you look at where we can finance a ten-year right now, we can issue around 4%. And the maturities that are coming up in the near-term are going to be at higher rates than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Michael Blum","I guess first question is, you previously talked about a five times target for leverage. Is that still the target and if so what do you think is the timeline to achieve it now.","Kim Dang","Well, I think that is the target and I think we have made substantial progress towards that target which is why we felt comfortable with the dividend and share repurchase guidance that we are giving today. If you look at our debt balance at 9.30 of 2015 with the end of the last quarter before we reduced the dividend, we paid down $5.8 billion. Over $5.8 billion in debt since that period. And so now I think the deleveraging is going to come through two methods. One as EBITDA grows, as these projects come on. And two, because we are funding our projects with 100% equity because we are funding it with the retained cash flow. And so we will continue to make progress towards the five times, but it's going to be a little slower in reducing that leverage than we have been to date because we are returning some value to shareholders at this point in time given that we have a little bit more flexibility with our balance sheet.","Michael Blum","Okay. And then for your dividend guidance out to 2020, you gave some coverage targets as well. What are you assuming for growth capital as a run rate from 2018 to 2020 to sort of pay out that dividend, maintain the coverage, the buybacks etcetera.","Kim Dang","It varies by year. And so, basically we ran off the backlog and then we made some assumptions around what we thought opportunities would look like. So we did put in some unidentified capital in there and to the extent that we have had a high probability project that weren't in the backlog, we would have included those as well. So we tried to take a holistic look at what we thought CapEx would look like going forward, not just running after backlog.","Michael Blum","Can you say what the kind of average annual is for the three years?","Kim Dang","I don\u2019t remember what it was, Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from Linda Ezergailis from TD Securities. Your lines is now open.","Linda Ezergailis","I appreciate the update on the Trans Mountain expansion, permitting and construction timeline. I was just wondering if you could maybe also give us a sense of what might define the tempo of construction in terms of potentially any sort of gating factors tied to permitting or other considerations that might affect the pace of construction. Or what sort of slack you have built in to account for some uncertainties?","Steve Kean","Yes. I think, Linda the way to think about it is that commencing this fall, the bulk of the work is going to be preparation for major construction commencing next year and that was all was the plan. So the permit acquisition and the priority of permitting activity is built around that. So I think that you look at what you need to do to prepare to construct and with things like clearing and terminal work and preparation of sites etcetera. So that\u2019s the kind of activity that we will likely be involved in this year commencing in September, with more the heavy lifting occurring early next year.","Linda Ezergailis","Okay. Thank you. And would you be able to perhaps stratify the remaining $6.1 billion cost between parts, labor and anything else?","Steve Kean","I don\u2019t have that right in front of me, Linda. Obviously, the bulk of the cost, our labor cost, the bulk of those cost will be incurred in '18 and '19 with the peak sometime in later '18. But I don\u2019t have it stratified to any degree than that.","Ian Anderson","Yes. So I think that, if you look at it, the construction is still to come, so that\u2019s going to be construction, equipment, materials, all of those things. The amounts that would have been spend to this point would have been more around land acquisition and permitting cost and the like. So now the costs going forward are going to be more of construction and materials and equipment. Construction including labor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.","Becca Followill","Just following up on Michael's question. You are targeting I think 5.1 times debt to EBITDA at the end of '17. Target is to get to five times. If you are funding 100% of your capital needs with cash flow, that seems like that would take you well under or just slightly under the five times going into 2018. So you would already be there. Then you have access to cash. So can you help me reconcile that with a buyback over a three year period and the target of five times.","Kim Dang","Yes. First of all, I think what we have said is, we are at 5.1 times today at the end of the second quarter. So we would expect to end the year at 5.2 times that we ended the quarter on our debt balance a little bit lower than we were expecting because some of our expansion capital flushed to the second half of the year. I think we are still on target to end next year at 5.2 times -- end '17 at 5.2 times. Then next year on a fully consolidated basis, we are going to show the Trans Mountain revolver, the Trans Mountain construction facility in our number. And so our debt to EBITDA numbers will be bearing the full load of the expansion CapEx. And so it will take some time, even though we are funding all of our other CapEx with 100% equity, it will take some time to bring that down to 5.0.","Operator","Speakers, there are no questions in queue at this time.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you very much, everybody. We view this as really important day at KMI and we are glad you were here to ask your questions. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"12449":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

At this time, all participants are placed on listen-only until we start the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Vance.","Before we begin I\u2019d like to remind you that as usual today's earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements. With that out of the way let me get to the meat of the matter.","As usual, I\u2019ll give an overview of the third quarter and in addition, try to put some perspective on the happenings in our portion of the energy industry. Then I'll turn it over to Steve Kean our CEO and Kim Dang our CFO who will talk in more detail about 2015 and the outlook for 2016. And then as usual, we'll take any and all questions that you may have.","Let me start by reviewing our 2015 performance. We raised the dividend for the third quarter to $0.51 and we expect to achieve our target of declaring $2 for full-year 2015. As you may recall that\u2019s an increase of 15% over 2014 and on top of that we estimate we will have excess coverage for the year of about $300 million.","Now, that's less coverage than our budget which assumes $70 WTI and $3.80 natural gas prices, and Kim will take you through the details of that variance. But still substantial in our view at the level of $300 million.","To me it demonstrates what we have been saying. That is that we are insulated from the direct and indirect impacts of very low commodity environment, but we are not immune. And I promise it to put things in perspective. And let me try that.","If you take our $2 dividend and multiply it times with 2.2 billion shares outstanding. That's $4.4 billion of cash distributions to shareholders that we will make for 2015. If you add to that $300 million in excess coverage that means $4.7 million of free cash flow after payment of all our operating expenses, our maintenance CapEx, interest on our debt.","Now we could have paid for all of our expansion CapEx for this year and had a lot of money left over. Our capital expenditure budget for this year is about $3.5 billion estimated for the full year.","So with that in mind I think that this idea that midstream energy companies like Kinder Morgan are not sustainable generators of cash flow just doesn't hunt. Rather we elected to distribute the bulk of our free cash flow to our shareholders and then pay for our expansion CapEx with the combination of equity and debt and we intend to do this in the future.","That said we intend to continue covering all of our dividends with our generated free cash flow and remain investment-grade, watch our CapEx closely and continue within those parameters to grow our dividend.","We're going to be judicious about using common equity, and as Steve will explain we intend to use other means of raising equity so that we will not be required to issue common equity or access those markets through at least the middle of next year.","Now let me also put in perspective our business and its prospects for the future. I talked about analogizing our business to a toll road that to the extent that you're probably tired of hearing it. I'm kind of sick of using it myself. And that phrase happens to be very true.","But I want to give you some hard cold facts about the natural gas story which is our single most important business. As many of you know our natural gas operations produce over half of our cash flow and we move about a third of all the gas consumed in the United States. So, to put it very simplistically as natural gas demand grows, so do we.","Now everybody talks about natural gas being the fossil fuel of the future because it's abundant cheap mastic and clean and that's all true. But I thought it would be interesting to give you some actual factual detail on what's really happening on both the demand and supply side of the natural gas story because it's so important to us and to other midstream companies.","If you compare 2014 to 2015 with McKenzie is now estimated there will be an increase in demand year-to-year of 5%. Its projected increase from today's level of 76 Bcf a day to about 110 Bcf a day by 2025, that's an increase of 40%.","Now, there are really four drivers of this growth. The first and probably the most interesting is electric generation. If you look at the 15 mix of generating output and this is according to the EIA, 32% is gas and 33% coal.","For those of you who have been in this industry a long time or followed it you know that that represents a dramatic shift to the positive for natural gas. If you flash ahead again these are EIA numbers to 2030 their projection of the mix of generation is 39% gas, 18% coal. If you want to look at something closer to home or ERCOT in state of Texas through July of 2015 had a mix of 49% natural gas versus 39% a year ago.","If you want to look at Kinder Morgan specifically our gas transportation volumes for electric generation are up 18% year-to-date 2015 versus the same period 2014. Nationally for the third quarter of this year a 4.4 Bcf a day increase from the third quarter of 2014.","So these are real numbers, real occurrences that are happening in the natural gas storage. Woodmet [ph] projects 8.6 Bcf a day growth in electric generation load from 15 Bcf to 25 Bcf. Now renewables get a lot of attention and they should but let me put them into perspective.","To be frank about it they\u2019re small and less reliable. Wind and solar combined generated less than 5% of total U.S. generating load in 2014. And an indicative of the lack of reliability again 14 numbers capacity utilization for wind was 34% and solar 28%.","Now that should not come as a surprise to anybody of any common sense because we should realize that the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time but some people have apparently neglected that understanding.","But what this really means is that reliable flexible natural gas facilities are absolutely necessary to back up wind and solar. So to sum up the idea that we could move directly from coal to renewables without increasing natural gas usage for electronic generation is an unrealistic pipe dream with the substance and the pipe being legal only in Colorado and Washington State.","Now, added to the demand picture is the retirement of more coal plants due to environmental regulations and a nuclear fueled instruments due to age and operational issues and you put all that together and you have a very bullish growth Outlook for natural gas and electric generation.","But there are other factors. The second demand driver\u2019s natural gas exports to Mexico. It\u2019s a real and it\u2019s growing. Let me give you the facts. Natural gas exports to Mexico for 2015 are expected to average 2.6 Bcf a day versus a 2014 average of 1.8 Bcf a day. That\u2019s an increase of 44%. This summer we found that natural gas exports had at times exceeded 3 Bcf a day.","Over the next four years, Mexico is expected to add 10.5 gigawatts of new natural gas capacity and it's expected that another 3.2 gigawatts of oil power capacity will switch to natural gas. Meanwhile as I think most of us know, Mexico\u2019s gas production continues into decline.","Additionally LNG imports to Mexico are on the decline and are expected to be completely phased out by 2023. All of these factors support projections that by 2025 natural gas exports to Mexico are expected to increase from the already elevated levels of 2015 by almost 3 Bcf a day.","Third driver is the tremendous build-out of US industrial and petrochemical facilities. Let me give you the facts. The American Chemistry Council now counts 243 projects with a cumulative investment of $147 billion for the years 2010 to 2023.","More germane, Texas alone accounts for 99 of those projects with the total value of over $48 billion and most of those are in Southeast Texas which is the sweet spot of the heartland of our natural gas facilities including Houston Corpus Christi and Beaumont.","Global chemical demand is expected to double from 2000 to 2040. Wood Mack estimates that over 2.5 Bcf a day of additional natural gas will be required by 2018 from 2015 levels to meet industrial demand driven by these methanol fertilizer and petrochemical projects.","Finally let's talk about LNG exports. There are no longer years away. FERC approved LNG export projects have 10.6 Bcf a day of capacity. By the end of this year Sabine Pass Train 1 will be in service with 650 million a day of capacity. By next year with Sabine Pass Trains 1 through 3 online LNG capacity will be 1.95 Bcf a day.","By 2019 U.S. LNG export capacity will be 8.97 Bcf a day only counting FERC approved projects which have achieved final investment decision. Now those are the trends that are driving U.S. demand to that extraordinary growth I talked about to 110 Bcf estimated in 2025.","Do we have the supply to meet that? The potential gas committee estimated that at the end of last year. The end of 2014, we had nearly 2,900 Tcf of proven and potential reserves and that would be over 100 years of remaining resources relative to the current U.S. natural gas demand.","Now in addition to being affordable and abundant, I want to stress again some facts about the environmental friendliness of natural gas. In the midst about half the carbon dioxide emitted by coal and over 30% less than fuel oil according to the EIA. In fact natural gas has been essential to national and regional efforts to reduce carbon emissions.","The White House\u2019s counseled economics reported earlier this year -- economic advisers reported earlier this year, and I quote, natural gas is playing a central role in the transition to a clean energy future'. Report goes on to note that since 2007 energy-related CO2 emissions in the U.S. have fallen 10% and a significant factor contributing to the reduction was fuel switching from coal to natural gas for electric generation.","On a regional basis I saw New England has stated that as a result of New England\u2019s transition from coal and oil to natural gas from 2001 to 2013 regional emissions of CO2 fell by 23%. Regional emissions of NOx fell by 66% and regional emissions of SOx fell by 91%.","Now what I've given you is a lot of facts. But they demonstrate to us that natural gas usage in this country is and will be robust and growing for an extended period of years. And for Kinder Morgan which transports about a third of all the natural gas consumed this paints a very positive business picture for years to come.","And with that I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. And from --- what Rich has just said you can see why we are bullish about the fundamentals that drive our long-term value and I'm going to return to the shorter-term for a minute. I'm going to pick up on what Rich said about being judicious on use of common equity.","Because we are generating cash in increasing amounts in our business, we have the flexibility to fund our investments in any number of ways, ranging from self funding them with the cash that we generate, all the way to disturbing our cash to shareholders and accessing capital markets to fund our growth expenditures. We believe our investors value the later, so we have been working within that framework.","In a nutshell, what we have been working on and believe we have found is a way to break a cycle which we believe has negatively affected the value of our equity.","Specifically, the challenging market for energy commodities this year has bled over to equity values for midstream energy companies. And because we have a significant backlog of projects, growth projects, which is a good thing, we have issued into this challenged equity market for the last two quarters, creating at least a perceived overhang in the market for our equity.","We believe in the medium and long-term the market will value our common equity appropriately and we believe the market will value our particular structure that is a simplified large cap C-Corp with a substantial and growing dividend also appropriately.","But until that happens, we sought an alternative means to fund our growth capital needs without needing to issue shares in the common equity market for the rest of this year and to mid-2016.","That means not having to use the ATM or underwritten offerings or bought deal. It means not having to sell common equity at all for that period. Let me repeat that. It means not having to sell common equity at all for that period.","We've chosen the alternative we plan to use and that choice reflects our bullishness on the long-term value of our common equity. And this comes from a management team and board with substantial holdings of common equity.","So here's the bottom line for our equity investors. First we're taking off whatever pressure that our common equity issuances were having on the stock. Second, we're continuing to fund our growth projects, but at a lower long-term cost of equity capital than continuing to issue common equity in today's market.","Third, we're growing the dividend while maintaining coverage of that dividend. Finally we are maintaining our investment-grade rating, which we believe, positions us well for acquisitions and expansions in this environment.","Before turning to the segments and the project backlog there's an issue I'll try to address upfront. When we did our consolidation transaction last year, we projected 15% dividend growth in 2015 with 10% annual growth from 2016 to 2020 and substantial excess coverage over the 2015 to 2020 period. Here's what we expect.","We have not started our 2016 budget reviews with the business units yet. But we expect to be able to cover a dividend that is 6% to 10% higher than the 2015 dividend which was 15% higher than last year. As we've said before with what's happened in energy over the last 12 months, the coverage we projected last year in the consolidation transaction has taken a substantial head.","Nevertheless, and while projections through 2020 are very assumption driven, we believe we could still have grown the dividend at the rate we have projected last year, however, coverage would've been tight over the period and could have been negative part of the time.","Other companies have elected to run at negative coverage, but we believe the prudent decision for KMI and we believe the market is telling us this, is to continuing to grow the dividend but preserve coverage over the period.","Again, our underlying business is generating cash in increasing amounts. So for us it's not about finding a way to continue investing in attractive opportunities it\u2019s a question about finding the right combination of dividend growth and coverage and the appropriate alternative financing and we think that in today's broader energy sector that's an enviable position to be in.","I'll turn to the backlog in the segments; the backlog first, since the July update, our product backlog decreased by about 700 million from 22 billion to 21.3 billion. We placed almost $400 million worth of projects in service during the quarter, the largest one of which was the second splitter in the Houston Ship Channel which went into service early in the quarter.","We added about $700 million for the projects in the quarter, much of that coming from the terminals business unit. We also removed about $1 billion worth of projects from the backlog. The largest piece of which is further reductions in our expansion capital expenditures and our CO2 business as a result of moving some of our EOR and S&T investments outside of the timeframe of the backlog.","So, for the segments, in the third quarter, we produced 1.839 billion of segment earnings before DD&A which essentially flat to 2014 and that's a result of the decline in our CO2 segment year-over-year not being fully offset by the year-over-year improvement in our Products and Terminals business segments.","For gas, gas was essentially flat year-on-year. We had commodity related volume impacts in our G&P sector. We had a roll-off -- a contract role off on KinderHawk in May, partially offset with -- an additional volume commitment on the Eagle Ford by that same shipper.","We have the KML, Kinder Morgan Louisiana contract buyout that took place last year. We're having the effect of that this year on earnings before DD&A and roll-offs on the Cheyenne Plains system.","Now those last three items were all anticipated in our budgeting process and we're still on track in gas to slightly exceed the 2015 plan. We had higher transport volumes, up 5% across the segment as we saw a 50% interest increase in power driven natural gas demand year-over-year and 18% year-to-date as Rich mentioned.","Sales and gathered volumes were essentially flat year-over-year, Crude and Condensate gathered volumes and the Gas group were up 7% as a result of the addition of the Hiland gathering assets. We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity.","We added 400 a day of firm long term commitments during the quarter that brings the total capacity signed up since December of 2013 to 9.1 Bcf of new and pending long-term commitments.","Of that 9.1% it's worth noting 1.6 Bcf of that comes from existing previously unsold capacity. So these signups are adding to our project opportunities but also making better use of the existing capacity that we have.","Couple of project updates here, we made great progress during the quarter signing up long-term commitments for capacity on the supply portion of Northeast Energy Direct. We have not yet moved this product into the backlog depending on some further progress on additional commitments. But the prospects for adding this to the NED Market Path product which is in our backlog materially improved during the quarter.","We also had good progress on the NED Market Path. We went out with a customized offering for the electric load in New England a much-needed load and much-needed for gas.","And we had a few favorable rulings and recommendations in the state regulatory processes including improving our existing LDC contracts and also creating a good opportunity to secure the electric load that we need to make this project very attractive economically.","So we continue to see strong demand for existing and expansion capacity on our gas assets and we believe we're well-positioned for the growth that Rich outlined that we see in the years ahead for those markets.","We did have a setback on the Elba project we got a scheduling order that slows the regulatory process deferred by four to five months versus what we expected. We may seek modifications to that order to try to improve on that schedule and we're certainly going to look for ways to call back some of that in the project execution phase.","Turning to CO2, earnings there before DD&A were 282 million, down 22% year-over-year. For pricing reasons primarily also some volumes reasons as well. Our volumes are down year-over-year by 2% on a net basis now a few more points of that.","First, the decline in that volume can be more than explained by a timing issue on Yates. Our net numbers that you see in the release are based on sold volumes. But some of the production in Yates was produced in September, but not transfer for sale until October, the amount of that totally offsets the year-over-year downturn for the whole net production of the group.","Second, sack rock was down slightly for the quarter, but up 6% year-to-date and on track for a record year. Finally Goldsmith and Katz were both up year-over-year, but continue to be well below our plan.","We had been successful in expecting cost savings in this segment. We continue to forecast reductions in our OpEx and maintenance CapEx of just under 25% for the year. We've also seen cost savings in our expansion projects and it\u2019s demonstrated by the adjustments of the backlog, we are right sizing they spend in this segment in light of the current commodity price environment.","Turning to the products group, segment earnings before DD&A were 287 million that\u2019s up 29% year-over-year driven by the ramp-up of volumes on KMCC, our crude and condensate serving the Eagle Ford. The addition of Double H Pipeline from the Hiland acquisitions, improve performance on SFPP, as well as better year-over-year results on Cochin.","Also early in the quarter we placed the second of our two splitters in service in the Houston Ship Channel. Volumes are strong here with refined products volumes up 2.5% on our systems year-over-year compared to a nationwide EIA growth rate of 1.5% and year-to-date we\u2019re running a little bit over 3%. We continue to advance our Palmetto refined products pipeline project and our Utopia NGL pipeline project.","Turning to Terminals, segment earnings before DD&A were 263 million, up 6% from last year. This segment is the tale of two cities. Our liquids business performing very well both in terms of ongoing business and the growth opportunities while our bulk business has been hit with declining coal and steel business impact of the Alpha Natural Resources bankruptcy on our coal business. FX was also a negative factor for the Canadian portion of our terminals operations.","On the liquids side we\u2019re benefiting from higher renewal rates particularly in Houston benefiting from expansions in Houston and Edmonton that we brought online and from additions to our Jones Act tanker fleet.","We also announced earlier in the quarter the Philly Tankers acquisition which takes our fleet up to 16 vessels all but two of which are under charter and the other two are in active negotiation even before they roll out of the yard.","We announced yesterday a joint venture with BP on about 9.5 million barrels of their refined product storage assets. This is exactly the kind of deal we want to do with companies that have midstream business assets embedded in a larger organization.","We believe we can make a win-win here with BP. BP will contract for substantial capacity in support of their marketing activity and then we have the ability to operate and attract third party business, operate this more efficiently and attract third party business to these assets. We look forward to expanding our already productive relationship with them and finding other opportunities like this. ","Finally for Canada, the segment is down 8 million year-over-year all of which can be explained by FX. The pipeline system itself continues to benefit from high utilization. And the big news as always here at the Trans Mountain expansion project.","We received our draft conditions in August, a little bit later than what we had expected. We believe they will be manageable though we did seek some important changes, especially around the time required to approve specific portions of the bill.","One of our expert witnesses was hired or appointed to the NEB out of an abundance of caution the NEB ordered us to file substitute testimony which we did in September, but the result of all this was they delayed date for their decision, their recommendation from the end of January 2016 to the end of May, May 20, 2016.","We're still working through the full effect of that and the ultimate impact on our in-service date is ultimately going to depend on the final conditions that we receive in May, however we're going to do the best we can here to give you an estimate of the range of that impact and we estimate today a range of in-service dates between yearend 2018 and October 2019.","Again there are lots of moving parts here and we're going to be working hard on our detailed project execution plan to optimize all that, but that's about the best guidance we can give you sitting here today on the in-service dates.","A reminder also that this expansion is under long-term contracts, which have been approved by the NEB. We're very excited about this project. It\u2019s very good for our shareholders. We're going to get it done, but we are experiencing this delay.","That is it for the segment and project updates, so I will turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Thanks Steve. Looking at the GAAP income statement first before I move to DCF. On the face of the GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down significantly versus the corresponding period last year. But you'll also see that OpEx is significantly reduced.","If you net out the certain items that impact revenues and OpEx, the largest of which are the $198 million contract buyout on KMLA in the third quarter 2014 and the CO2 mark-to-market. OpEx was down slightly more than revenue, both in the quarter and year-to-date.","As I said the last two quarters changes in revenues is not a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not.","We also do not think that EPS is a good performance indicator. But for those of you who need EPS without certain items for compliance reasons, the EPS without certain items is approximately $0.16 a share.","We believe the better indicator of our performance is the cash that we generate which we express in DCF per share in the cash that we distribute which is the dividend per share and so with that I'll go to our calculation of distributable cash flow.","As Rich said, we're declaring a dividend today of $0.51 which is an increase of $0.16 over the third quarter of last year. Year-to-date that results in dividends of $1.58, which is a 15% increase over the $1.48 declared for the nine month in 2014.","We generated DCF for the quarter of $1.129 billion and 3.47 billion for the first nine months of the year. Both periods are up significantly over the prior year. The prior-year results are fused in transaction closed and so the lot of the benefit in DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding. And you can see that benefit in the line entitled MLP declared distribution.","I think the better way to look at our results is to look at the DCF per share which takes into account both the benefits to DCF of the transaction as well as the cost of the 1.1 billion shares that we issued to purchase the MLPs. DCF per share is $0.51 in the third quarter versus $0.44 in the third quarter last year which is an increase of approximately 21%.","Year-to-date we have generated $1.58 versus $1.29 that we paid or 22% increase. The $0.51 in DCF per share for the quarter results in coverage of about one times in the quarter and for year-to-date we have coverage of well over $200 million.","Now there are couple of certain items that I should mention and then I'll give you some details on our full-year outlook. We reported in the quarter $387 million non-cash impairment on our Goldsmith deal, which is in our CO2 segment. Now it\u2019s primarily driven by lower crude prices.","The other certain items of any significance to fair value amortization and the mark-to-market, we see those in most quarters and we've discussed them in the past. The only exception is in the other category. It includes a $22 million write-off of receivables associated with the Alpha bankruptcy.","The $22 million represents revenues reported in periods prior to 2015. The $50 million negative impact associated with 2015 revenues is shown in the segment. And this is consistent with our philosophy of trying to strip out of our segments prior periods one times and the sporadic cost and benefits to show you the ongoing cash generating ability of our assets.","Now the full-year outlook, first, we expect to end the year with approximately $300 million in excess coverage which is below our budget by about $350 million. But let me put this in perspective. That reduction is just 6% of our total BCF and only about 5% of our EBITDA.","Now looking through the components of that if you utilize the metrics that we gave you in January, of the $10 million change in DCF for every dollar change incurred and a $3 million change in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas the impacts to our results is approximately $235 million.","That is a little less than -- that's a little -- that\u2019s approximately a $70 million deterioration from what we expected at the time of the second quarter call due to deteriorations in commodity prices subsequent to that call.","As we talked about last quarter our sensitivity assumed a constant NGL to crude ratio. That ratio is actually deteriorated from what we had in our budget meaning that NGL prices have deteriorated more than crude prices. We estimate that impact to be a little bit less than $30 million.","The direct commodity exposure accounts for a significant portion of our coverage variance. Lower CO2 volumes, lower midstream volumes and the decline in the Canadian exchange rate on a combined basis are about $100 million impact. So, those items when you add them altogether gives you pretty close to where we expect to end up.","Now, there are lots of moving pieces of other moving pieces. We the benefits in interest expense. We've seen CO2 and other cost savings. We've got downsized in coal and steel in our Terminals business.","We've lower oil production volumes in our CO2 segment. We've got lower volumes from some of our product assets and we've got lower capital is overhead as a result of reduced expansion CapEx. But all of these other moving pieces essentially net-out to be a small positive.","Now, to look at the individual pieces to give a little bit more granularity. We expect natural gas to end the year slightly above budget as Steve mentioned. We expect that the positive impact of the Hiland acquisition to largely be offset by the lower commodity prices and lower gathering and processing volumes affecting our midstream business.","We expect CO2 to end the year approximately 15% below and that's actually a little bit more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate. And that's being driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2 volumes, and lower capitalized overhead, slightly offset by about $43 million in cost savings.","We expect Terminals to end the year about 6% below its budget and that's associated with lower coal and steel volumes. The largest piece being the $22 million impact of the Alpha bankruptcy and the FX associated with the weaker Canadian dollar.","We expect products to end the year slightly below its budget and there the positive impact of Double Eagle pipeline which was acquired in the Hiland acquisition. Is slightly more than offset by about -- is slightly more than offset by about $20 million of commodity prices on the segment, that's consistent with our sensitivity that we gave you and lower volumes on a number of assets.","We expect KMCC to be below its budget by the year due to FX and that's going to be about, we think about $20 million. We expect to have positive variances versus our budget and interest, negative variance in G&A. Those two items largely offset each other. The variance in G&A is driven by incremental G&A from the new Hiland employees and lower capitalized overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending.","On interest, incremental interest associated with the Hiland transaction is more than offset by lower balance and lower rates. Finally, we expect cash taxes and sustaining CapEx to come in lower than our budget, said in another way, we expect them to be a favorable variance versus our budget.","And with that I'll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with about $42.5 billion in debt. That translates into debt to EBITDA of about 5.8 times. That is consistent with where we ended the second quarter. We still expect to end the year at about 5.6 times debt to EBITDA.","The change in debt for the quarter, there was a reduction in debt about $172 million. And for the full year it's an increase in debt of 1.845 billion. So let me reconcile those for you.","On the quarter we spent about a little less than $980 million in expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We made $50 million pension contribution. We had about $7 million in warrant repurchase. We issued equity of $1.27 billion.","We had coverage of $2 million and that we had working capital and other items of just over $60 million. Year-to-date the 1.845 we spent about $6 billion this year just under that on acquisitions expansion capital and contributions to equity investments still in our investment program.","About $3.3 billion of that was acquisitions, about $2.65 billion was on expansion capital. We made a pension contribution of $50 million. We repurchased north of $12 million. We issued a little over $3.8 billion in equity. We had a tax refund of $194 million that came in the first quarter. We've had coverage of about $228 million and then working capital and other items or use of cash of about $45 million.","So with that, I will turn it over to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay. And with that Vance if you come back on, we'll take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, Shneur. How are you doing?","Shneur Gershuni","Good. How are you Rich?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Shneur Gershuni","Good. Just a couple of quick questions. You know, I guess if we can start off with your financing plans that you alluded to in the prepared remarks. I guess you talked about widening of the dividend growth range which is probably prudent in this current market environment. But you also mentioned no need for equity into the second half of next year.","I imagined excess dividend coverage is part of it but I was wondering if you can elaborate on how you're thinking about it, are you thinking about a convert. Is that something that the rated agency typically scores equity? Any incremental of color would definitely be helpful to understand the financing plans for next year.","Rich Kinder","Well, unfortunately SEC rules prohibit us from really going into any more detail, but as Steve said, we have picked a vehicle and we intend to implement that.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. Fair enough. I was wondering if we can talk about the backlog next. You've removed some projects from the CO2 bucket, but to also did net add $700 million worth of projects. I was wondering if you can talk about in an environment where we're much longer for lower commodity environment.","Outside of CO2 what do you think the sensitivity of commodity prices would be to the balance of the backlog? Is there a price that you're thinking about today that has sort of benchmarks what gets into the backlog and so forth? If you could give us some color as to how we think about that that would be helpful.","Rich Kinder","Yeah. It's really not commodity-price driven at all. So, what we are putting in the backlog outside of CO2 which is a little bit different. I'll come back to that in a second. What we're putting into the backlog are things that we have contracts on and we're waiting on a permit.","Some of the stuff that's in the backlog is already under construction. We just don't have revenue yet because it having gone into service.","So, these are high probability projects that are secured by contracts for the customer is really taking the risk on what the volume is going to be and what the commodity price is going to be ultimately.","So, these are really with the exception of CO2 which again I'll come back to these are midstream assets were people are buying the space from us and securing and under contracts and then we go get it approved and build it. And if we think it's a high probability that it gets done, it makes into the backlog. That's really the criteria. It's that probability of completing it and getting revenue from it for our investors.","CO2 -- and I have said this before when we have talked about additions to the CO2 backlog in the past in a different commodity price environment. CO2 is programmatic spend. Right? It is driven more by -- we are going to invest in this development or we are going to invest in this expansion, because we think the pricing is there to support it.","And we try to be conservative in the pricing and all of that. But that\u2019s a little bit more programmatic and therefore is more driven by commodity spend -- or commodity pricing.","Now, the other thing that\u2019s going on in CO2 this year that you will see is that the S&T part of our business, we feel like we've got -- we've got a much smaller CapEx plan that we need in order to meet the demand for CO2 as we see it. And so we've scaled back investments, for example, we talked about the Lobos pipeline earlier. We had talked about the Cortez pipeline, which we're proceeding with in part.","We've scaled back that to deal with a current flattening of demand, call it, in the CO2 environment. The other thing that\u2019s happened in a CO2 is that we've had good results on the projects we have proceeded with.","So for Cow Canyon, for example, we were not even quite halfway into our drilling program. We had very good results and we don't see the need to finish that program until we see additional demand. The additional production that we got from the first six wells or so was enough to take care of what we think we need.","So that\u2019s how the backlog shapes up. You've got to separate CO2 from the other midstream parts of the business and those are contractually secured. ","Shneur Gershuni","Just one last question if I may, you talk about the backlog being contracted and so forth. I was wondering if you can remind us of your customer breakdown.","If I remember correctly you're not that linked to the producers and it's more to utilities and industrial customers. I was wondering, if you happen to have that breakdown of customers on hand as to how it looks in your backlog and legacy business?","Rich Kinder","Yes. There are a couple of ways to get at that. I mean, first of all we have a very broad customer base. So we have very few customers that account for even more than 1% save our revenues. So we\u2019ve got utilities. We have producers like BP and Shell are very large customers of ours, Utilities our large customers, the refiners, the integrators all of them and producers and LNG.","So we\u2019ve got a very broad group. The other way of looking at it is just kind of where our growth is coming from. And I think in this 9.1 Bcf I think there's about -- I'm talking about the gas side now. The 9.1 Bcf of what we've signed up. About a third each goes to LNG and producers and then the other third is made up of utilities and Mexico. So that's how that breaks down.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Blossman with Tudor Pickering Holt and Company. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon.","Brandon Blossman","Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, Steve to get back to the financing question in the alternate forms. Won't hit on that specifically, but you have a plan for the next call it nine months plus.","What do you need to the change -- the answer is probably pretty apparent but what you need to see in change in terms of common equity to be comfortable going back to that as a form of financing. It is just a yield program problem or is it a depth or liquidity problem for the common? ","A - Steve Kean","It's not a liquidity problem in any way, shape or form. We're very liquid security and the market has a significant appetite for the security. So, it's really more the cost of equity capital to us and what we believe we're seeing Brandon is a temporary situation where the cost of that common equity is higher than, at least in our opinion our judgment, higher than it should be.","And it has created a situation where we can access alternative forms of capital at a lower long-term cost of capital for this interim period whatever it turns out to be. They once need particular magic in doing it to mid next year other than to communicate to you and all the other investors out there that we have options and we can stay out of the common equity market for a significant period of time.","So, there's not a magic number that we have in mind to come back and it's really going to be more driven by the cost of our available sources of capital and I think we're going to be demonstrating to you that we have flexibility in that regard.","Brandon Blossman","Thank you. That's actually very helpful. And then on the project aside, Northeast Direct, is it fair to make the assumption that the power product for the demand side of the project was tied to the Massachusetts ruling and is it necessary for other states to kind of have a similar ruling in terms of allowing gas supply into the power gen rate base.","Rich Kinder","That's just thrilling, it very positive obviously. Beyond that, Steve.","Steve Kean","I will start and end time can fill in too. So, what we call the PowerServe, the offering that\u2019s specific to power generators or the power market, let's call it, predated the Massachusetts order. But the Massachusetts order was very affirming in that regard, we believe. It\u2019s the recognition of and the need to provide a mechanism for approving and recovering the cost associated with the needed upstream firm gas transportation capacity. So those things go very much hand in glove in our mind.","Other states will be doing their own processes to figure out how they are going to approach the securing of the contracts they need for their power generating sectors. But we're very optimistic about that. Now having said that, we're not going to come back next month and expect to see a whole bunch of the power loads signed up. We think this is going to take time, because these things are processes.","What Massachusetts is going to do is they are going to expect, I think, utilities to go out with some kind of a competitive process. And so it will take us some time. But we are very -- we're delighted with the steps that have been taken so far to put us in a position to place more of this capacity in the service of the power sector. Tom?","Tom Martin","Yeah. I guess the only thing that I would add to that, Steve, is that New Hampshire was also very positive in their PUC process and comments about natural gas and the need for additional infrastructure into the region.","New England ISO has been very positive along the way needing -- dating if there's needed additional reliability with the electric grid in this area by adding additional infrastructure. And we can't say a lot about the open season process, but I think there is interest in debt that\u2019s showing consistent with, kind of, the trend of showing a need for an incremental infrastructure into the region.","So I think there have been some very positive developments here over the last quarter. ","Steve Kean","And look -- let me just pound the table one more time on this issue. Just in the past few weeks you\u2019ve had another nuclear facility announced that its closing down. The thought is that there will be a second one. And that's on top of one that was already scheduled to be shut down.","You can't take 500 or 600 megawatts out and expect not to be able to use natural gas to fuel your needs for electric generation and the idea that somehow a swan is going to swooped down and deliver wind power or solar panel in the next few months or years even to New England is just not facing reality.","And the only practical choice in our judgment and it's a mix of a lot of things but natural gas has got to play we believe a major role in generating capacity in New England. And this is the whole underpinning of the whole Northeast Direct project on top of the very nice LDC demand that we have already buttoned up.","Brandon Blossman","Yes, okay. So moving in your favor I understand that there are many sunny days in the Northeast as one would like. And just finally real quick $630 million a day on the supply portion of Northeast Direct actually is in my mind a surprisingly large amount but it sounds like you guys are still looking for more on that side of the project? ","Steve Kean","Yeah, we\u2019re kind of -- we\u2019re still a little bit early in getting some of the LDC piece of that. So that\u2019s really it\u2019s kind of a producer push and some local significant local power demand and a little bit of LDC. But we think there is more of the utility load coming and so we're actively working on that and think we'll get some of it.","Rich Kinder","Yeah. Who know a lot here more over the next three or four months.","Brandon Blossman","Okay. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","How are you doing?","Darren Horowitz","Hey, fine. Thanks Rich, hope you and everyone are doing well. Steve couple of quick questions. The first to the extent that you can answer. With regard to lowering your long-term cash to capital, can you just give us even if it's a rough quantification the magnitude of cost to capital savings that you guys have penciled up with regard to reinvesting free cash flow versus the issuance of common equity burden by multiyear dividend growth ahead?","Am I'm just curious venue did the analysis of that cost of savings, was it more built of the extrapolation of 6% to 7% annual debt growth through the end of the decade or what was the duration and how much do you think you can save.","Steve Kean","Unfortunately Darren I cannot get into those specifics. But I think I can say that it was a substantial savings and enough so that we are prepared to execute on it.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. Well, if I could just shift gears back to in your prepared commentary about being flexible for the opportunity of third-party assets. How do you think the Northeast infrastructure supply\/demand dynamic changes not just the rear depending that is out there and maybe the impact on either commercializing the supply portion of NED or maybe commercializing the revised scale or scope of you and PT but am also thinking about any sort of opportunities that you guys see from a demand pull infrastructure perspective, maybe some logistical opportunities.","Maybe some with increase residual value that gives the opportunity to leverage our refined product business or your terminal footprint. Any commentary there would be helpful.","Rich Kinder","I think there are lot of opportunities and I think that as we've said so many times, having the footprint and the diverse assets that we have is a big plus in working out those kind of possibilities. And so obviously we see a lot of upside and a lot of potential.","It doesn't take -- everybody is aware of the fact that you've got a whole bunch of gas and liquids basically being underutilized or underpriced coming out of the fastest growing, producing region in America.","And getting those to the most needed market or where the greatest need is, New England is the first priority. But as we've said all along, we've reversed size proportions of Tennessee system to get it back down to this area to serve LNG load, the petrochemical load that I referred to.","So there's just a whole bunch of opportunities for us. And I think as we build these new projects they will lead to additional opportunities just as the Tennessee system has led to all these opportunities over the last couple of years. Tom anything else on that? ","Steve Kean","No.","Darren Horowitz","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Reichman with Simmons & Company. Your line is open.","Steve Kean","Hey Mark, how are you doing?","Mark Reichman","Good. Just a quick question on the rating agencies. I think on the last call you -- it was mentioned that they were willing to live with the elevated credit metrics until Alba and Trans Mountain were starting to contribute which would show some improvements in the credit metrics.","And I was just wondering now that it looks like both of those projects are experiencing some -- maybe some modest delays to the schedule, what have your conversations been with the rating agencies and how they in terms of what they are kind of looking for and timeframes for living with an elevated credit metric?","Kim Dang","So, this is recent news both on Trans Mountain and Elba, but with -- if the projects get pushed out, so does the spent. And so what\u2019s driving the leverage to stay high over time is the fact that you're spending dollars with no cash flow coming in. And so I believe will be able to manage through that.","Mark Reichman","And so that kind of maybe plays into managing spending and retaining more cash flow to fund growth as well as to deal with the weaker fundamental environment?","Kim Dang","I don't really think about the projects and the project delays being linked to our decision to go to the range or to look at coverage. No.","Mark Reichman","Okay. And\u2026","Rich Kinder","Let me just say again, just to be very clear on the range. As Steve and Kim have both indicated, we\u2019re just at the beginning of our budget process for 2016. So we're just giving you a range. It doesn't mean it won't be 10%.","We've given you a range from 6% to 10%. And we are going to be very judicious about how we approach the whole situation. But it is a range. It\u2019s not excluding the upper end of the range at all. So I think that's important to keep in mind as we move forward.","Mark Reichman","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kristina Kazarian","Hey guys I appreciate, so can you guys just talk a little bit maybe help me get some clarity around the decision to lower the bottom end of the range to 6%. How did you settle on that number and then what it implies for the longer-term range that we people have been using on 17%, 18%, and 19% if there is anything there.","Steve Kean","The 6% to 10% is just the uncertainty that we have the before we go into the budget process and wanted to make sure that we're going to be able to fulfill that and also aim for an appropriate amount of coverage.","And in terms of kind of the longer range I don't know how much you can really read into that. I think that you have to look at all of the kind of twos and froze within our underlying assumptions.","If you go back to where we were when we announced a consolidation transaction and just try to examine what has changed over that year. I mean certainly the one thing that's a negative that we talked about at length has been a change in commodity prices that direct and indirect impact of that.","On the plus side, we had a much improved tax depreciation benefit and attacks depreciation number from what we had when we originally rolled out the assumptions around the consolidation transaction.","Such that we know feel pretty confident. We're not going to be any kind of a significant cash taxpayer until 2020. If you think about the other things of that we're moving at the time, we also I think we projected some capital spend.","I think we have been physically on track on the amount of capital that we've deployed although we do have some pluses and minuses assisted with project delays or we have some minuses associated with project delays. So I think we've been able to find plenty of opportunities to invest in the capital.","And then, try and think, there's one other factor in there that built into -- we did not include anything for acquisitions. So we, I think, had a couple hundred million dollars and we had some small, kind of, tuck-in acquisitions assumed at the time and if we did any significant -- one or two significant acquisitions over the time period that would be potential upside to those numbers. So\u2026","Kristina Kazarian","I was going to say -- when I think about it historically that normally gives me the budget update, I think, in December. Do I think about from a long-term perspective maybe I get an update in December, do I get it what's like the next Analyst Day. How just roughly should I be thinking about this?","Steve Kean","Generally, we have updated our guidance in January. But I think go back to what Steve said at the beginning, which is, when we did Fusion, we believe we could grow at 10% per year and we had substantial excess coverage. And what we're saying today is that the deterioration in the energy markets have essentially taken away a lot of that excess cover, so some of our flexibility.","And so we could still choose to grow at the 10%, but coverage might be -- could be -- we don't know projections and very assumptions could be very tight and so we're just going to give ourselves the flexibility as we go forward to decide on how much coverage and how much to grow.","Kristina Kazarian","Really helpful. And then just lastly when I'm thinking about your target leverage level for year end. I know we talked about the 5.6 times. How do we think about that number for, say, like 2016, 2017? Like, what's a longer-term target I should be thinking of?","Steve Kean","In terms of the debt to EBITDA, I think what we have expected is to run at the higher end of the range 5.6 for a number of years until we get the -- until we get TransMountain some of the other projects on and then we would expect that to decline to the low five.","Kristina Kazarian","Okay. Thanks guys. And I appreciate your market commentary at the beginning. It was really helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Ted, how are you?","Ted Durbin","Hello Rich, doing all right. I guess, I hate to be the dead horse but the coverage issue is really what I'm kind of focused here and it just feels like moving 8% to the midpoint for 2016 how do we think about that on a multiyear basis.","You historically rank KMP pretty tight on coverage. Are you saying that you think because of the lower for longer environment coverage needs to be wider. I am just trying to get a sense of where your head is on coverage?","Rich Kinder","So again I think what we\u2019re -- and we think the market is telling us of this that, where things are valued right now and at our current equity yield, it doesn't appear that people are really valuing the growth in dividend so much as they are kind of some stability around that.","And so what we are trying to dial into here is to make sure that over the period over the next several years we have a growing dividend and really a substantially growing dividend because the underlying cash flows in our business are growing, but then we dial in appropriate coverage on that.","And so we're going to be striking that the balance as we go but that\u2019s I think the message we are hearing from the market and that's what we're acting on.","Steve Kean","And I think another important factor is we're continuing to generate the cash flow. As I said, if we want to grow at 10% we can grow at the 10%. So, what I think people ought to be concerned about is what's happening in the underlying business. And then we can make adjustments as we understand what the market value.","So, if the dividends are more important, we can pay those out. If is more important to have some flex ability than to have coverage then we can do that. So, I think -- and let me just say we've been saying for a number of months now that the coverage has been substantially diminished versus the time we did fusion because of the dramatic change in commodity market.","But -- and so, what we are saying today is no different with respect to what's happening underneath to our assets. All we're doing is telling you how we're going to be flexible in the future with respect to the dividend. ","Ted Durbin","Understood. And I guess then again thinking through then the backlog and how you are thinking about the hurdle rates on projects. Does -- I guess what you're saying is you're not happy with where the evaluation is in the equity they changed at all the investment criteria you're using around CapEx?","Steve Kean","We still in every project that we pursue, we're looking to get the highest possible return available in the market. That really hasn't changed. Now, when it comes to the cost of the capital -- so all of the stuff that's in our backlog is accretive.","It's beneficial to our investors even with today's elevated yield and elevated cost of capital. And obviously cuts into it a little bit the longer it lasts but are still very attractive investments even at our current cost of capital.","And will continue to be very judicious. And we are constantly reviewing among us and the business unit Presidents what our cost of capital is, on a long-term basis what it is, on the near-term basis, and making sure that we are being very careful to get returns that are an attractive premium to the cost of capital that we're incurring. ","Ted Durbin","And then the last one, I think I heard a comment, Steve, you said you don't think you're not going to be a cash taxpayer until 2020. I thought the number was more like 2017 or 2018. What changed there, that that's going to be up? ","Steve Kean","We now anticipate we will not be a significant federal tax payer -- cash tax payer until 2020. And that as Steve was saying, life in general is a mixed bag of things positives and negatives. And with return to -- in terms of the product Fusion what happened was, the negative obviously when we did that, we have the commodity price forward curve much higher than it is today.","Somewhat offsetting that is the fact that the cash -- the tax situation has improved and we've been able to extend the period during which we would not be a meaningful cash taxpayer. So that is a positive. ","Ted Durbin","Great. I'll leave it at that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Schmidt with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeremy Schmidt","Good afternoon.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon. How are you doing?","Jeremy Schmidt","Good. Thanks for the color today. I was just curious about the -- this vehicle that you talked about, that you can't give too much color on right now. When would you be in a position to tell us more? Is there any timing -- timelines that you could share with us as far as when you could tell us more about it? ","Rich Kinder","No timelines. I'm afraid it's as straightforward as you will know it when you know it. And everybody will know it at the same time. ","Jeremy Schmidt","Got you. And as far as this vehicle was concerned does this improve leverage or does it just keep you out of the equity markets. Is there anything that you can share with us on that?","Rich Kinder","Think the only thing for the general things that we already said which is what we are fundamentally trying to manage to. One is accessing the capital markets what we think is on a long-term list cost of capital available today, right basis.","And second is maintaining investment grade rating. And third of course it should of been first is maximizing value to our shareholders and so that\u2019s really the criteria that we used to evaluate among the alternatives that were available to us.","Jeremy Schmidt","Got you. Great. And then just one last one it's really early in the process and I know obviously commodity prices have been a big part of it just wondering when you're thinking about 2016 guidance and you talk about some uncertainty there that could drive dividend growth within that range of 6% to 10%, what are the other factors you see that her big variables that could push the results toward one end or the other?","Rich Kinder","The reason again for the range is just that we haven't gotten the specificity yet that we need to really be able to answer that question. The things that drive our business typically when we get into the budget process is a big focus that we place on costs.","That focus will be there again this year just as it always is, want to operate safely but efficiently. The impacts - the year-over-year impacts of the projects that have come online in 2015, the year-over-year impacts of contracts that have renewed, our assumptions about future renewals during the year and there will be pluses and minuses across the whole network that we'll be taking into account.","We think that for a business of our size, it's remarkable that we can call our shots really as well as we can and that's a function of the underlying stability of our business and we've historically been able to be very tight about our projection and put together a good budget. But those are the drivers that we look at really every year.","Jeremy Schmidt","Great. Thanks for that. And then just one last one if I could. Just with regards to M&A out there, how do you guys to see the market at this point in time and does this vehicle preclude you from doing anything in that arena?","Rich Kinder","It certainly doesn't preclude us, but I'll let Dax Sanders our VP of Corporate Development talk a little bit about the M&A market.","Dax Sanders","Yeah. Just give me a little flavor of the market and I kind of break the market into three buckets based on value. With respect to asset deals and kind of what I call low to mid nine figures are called a few hundred million dollars I think we're starting to see some opportunities. We have the just announced the BP deal and I think we're going to find some more deals over the next six to 12 months that are similar in size.","There are no guarantees, but I think there's going to be some opportunities to do one or more deals in that range. They don't necessarily move the needle as much as larger deal that are nice investments nevertheless.","You move up a little bit, it\u2019s a potential asset deal, single asset deals that are in the plus range with have continue to evaluate deals in that range and have looked at quite a few easily, but we're really just haven't to gotten their own valuation.","I think the bid off the spread issue that's so often discussed is persistent there. When taken into account some of those expectations on price and just the risks inherent that we simply haven't seen situation where we wanted to pull the trigger and I really have no idea when that is going to change.","With respect to larger corporate deals, who knows, as always those types of deals are much more difficult to do generally and especially to predict when they might be done. And of course regarding any large deal we have to make sure that our shareholders are rewarded for going down that path. ","Rich Kinder","Yeah. And nothing in what we're planning -- nothing, and as I said at the beginning, what we are trying to do including by maintaining investment grade rating is keep ourselves in good position to access that M&A market for opportunities that are attractive to us. ","Jeremy Schmidt","And anything on the international side of interest there, really kind of a North American focus? ","Rich Kinder","So far still a North American focus. I mean, would have to have really superb attractive returns to go outside of North America, I think, and we see plenty of continuing opportunities in North America.","But, again, as we've said, knowledge and the fact that we're no longer an MLP means that it gives us more ability, more flexibility to do projects outside of North America. But again that would have to be very high return projects for us.","Jeremy Schmidt","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Faisel. How are you doing?","Faisel Khan","Good. How are you doing Rich? Thanks for the time. Just -- Dax, going back to your comments around M&A. I appreciate you just putting it up into three different buckets.","On the third bucket, the large corporate M&A, are you saying that the valuations still don't look attractive or is it -- you've seen a lot of carnage in the MLP and midstream space. I'm just trying to understand, sort of, what your view is on the value, the corporate that sit in the market today. ","Rich Kinder","Yeah. So by the third bucket I assume you mean the large unit, you know, as we always say you\u2019ve got to have three things. First, you got the lumpy assets; you have to convert the three things.","First, you got the lumpy assets and then you got to have the evaluation and then you got to have the social issues. You\u2019ve got to have sort of the perfect conversions of those three items to make a deal happen and obviously we can't comment on any specific situation.","But I think probably any situation you can -- have it three of those converges is just extremely difficult and extremely difficult to predict when that's going to happen.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And in terms of sort of financing your growth I mean, if you look out in the debt markets today what's your preferred sort of mode in terms of financing your capital spending, is it through fixed floating or and how your debt issuance costs look today versus where they were six months ago?","Rich Kinder","Yeah, so we're going to find in order to maintain investment grade. So whatever mix of equity and debt that we need to do to maintain investment grade. Typically on new issuances we are funding on the debt side about 50% equity and about -- about 50% fixed and about 50% on floating.","So we\u2019re about 25% floating overall right now and that's just because when we did El Paso that acquisition came with a lot of fixed debt. But on an ongoing basis typically we're swapping about 50% of our debt. ","Faisel Khan","Okay.","Rich Kinder","Floating\u2026","Faisel Khan","Okay. Got you. And then on the cost as your debt issuance cost remain roughly the same over the last six months but it seems some issuers sort of see their spreads blow out a little bit even though their investment grade?","Rich Kinder","Yeah, our spreads have widened some but the treasury has come down a little bit as well. So it is a little bit higher today than it was six months ago.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Got you. And as I'm looking at your guys backlog of $21 billion so what is the procurement plan in that -- for that backlog of for steel and pipe and other materials.","We've seen the stronger dollar and we've seen the steel costs come down. So, what's the plan to try to reduce the cost of that backlog and sort of increasing returns or is there a plan to sort of look at that?","Rich Kinder","Well, there is always the plan to get everything for -- get it as cheaply as we can and to maximize our return by only spending as much as we have to and only spending at one we have to. And so, we do that kind of on a project-by-project basis and Faisal, it is really a mix of things across the spectrum.","Sometimes we will get steel trackers that are negotiating because that is a variable commodity and on a lead-time project, you're not sure what it's going to be when you get there. We've gone from having steel trackers. We have done some preorders.","We've done a variety of things and its really pretty situation-specific, but we're very focused on fighting the lowest-cost provider and reducing the spend as much as we can and managing it as close to when the revenue when the money starts to come in as we possibly can.","And if anything I think we're putting even more focus on that then we have historically. It's just we're watching all those things very closely.","Kim Dang","And to go back to your question on debt issuance. I think it would be a little less than 100 basis points more expensive today than it was at mid-year.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Got you and then just on the backlog, so does that incorporate sort of where steel costs are today and where they were sort of six to nine months ago?","Rich Kinder","We keep those things up-to-date. We review our major projects every month. And we also -- at least once a quarter, we go through the -- what our procurement group is showing us as the price per horsepower, the price per a ton of steel, the price for various diameters of pipe et cetera.","So we're tracking that pretty closely and every month we're asking, do we have cost savings. Are we starting to see contractors cut their prices because they're desperate for business, same thing with equipment providers, material providers and the rest of it and is it a mix.","Things are still pretty active in Houston and so we are not seeing much in the way of breaks there. But there are other places clearly where contractors are getting hungrier, particularly in the CO2 business, but also in some of our other assets. So we're -- we\u2019re just -- I don't know how better to answer it than to say we're very much on top of it. ","Faisel Khan","That\u2019s fair. I appreciate the time. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","Good evening, folks.","Rich Kinder","How are you doing?","Craig Shere","Good. I appreciate the call and keeping it going little longer here. Sorry to beat a dead horse. Did I understand the answer to Brandon's question about this alternative vehicle and the timing through not only second half this year, but first half next year as just being, we got to pick some point in time and this could -- we could really differ the equity issuance on an ongoing basis beyond that. We're picking this point in time to start. Is that what I thought I heard you say?","Rich Kinder","What we are saying is that we have mapped out a plan to avoid the necessity of going into the common equity market through the middle of next year -- rest of this year and the middle of next year. And beyond that we will take a look at what we want to do beyond that.","But again as Steve said just looking at this with the kind of yield we're trading at right now it just didn't make any sense to us to continue to have that overhang out there on issuing common equity. And so our view is to take that off the table, and longer-term and most importantly achieve on the long-term basis a cheaper cost of equity financing.","Craig Shere","Okay. I\u2019ll let it go at that.","Steve Kean","I'm sorry, we can't share more with you, but our General Counsel is sitting across the table from me. So, we just can't say any more under applicable rules without being -- we don't want to be front running anything. So as Steve said, you\u2019ll know I think soon enough and we'll go from there.","Craig Shere","Okay. And did I miss any comments about potential workaround for Palmetto given the Georgia decision in May?","Steve Kean","I can touch on it briefly just that we continue to make progress on that project we believe it has a real value to Georgia and Florida consumers and we have customers for it signed up. And so we are pursuing our appeal of the Georgia DOT decision.","We believe we've demonstrated the need that our customers certainly have by having signed up the contracts that they did. And so we continue to make progress on it and continue to pursue it and believe we'll get it done.","Craig Shere","Okay. And that's helpful. It's understandable that the EOR investment is coming down and some of the CO2. My question with SACROC kind of the lowest level now since third quarter 2014, we had a little drop this quarter.","What if this goes on for what have you another three to six quarter and then energy prices come back a bit and make some more sense to make investment, does the delay in ongoing investment impact the ability to get value for the same dollar out of the field?","Steve Kean","I'll ask Jesse to answer that, our CO2 President.","Jesse Arenivas","I think the reduction in SACROC is a performance issue, not an economic issue. We'll continue with the current prices to develop the field. We may have a temporary lull in production based on area in the field, but we are moving from outer field to improve production.","We're not pulling back on existing CO2 area in SACROC or Yeats or any [Indiscernible] at this point all economic of the current market.","Steve Kean","And we're not slowing down, but slowing down wouldn't leave oil -- we couldn't go back and recover.","Jesse Arenivas","And it can always be recovered.","Steve Kean","I think it's important to put this into perspective that we expect for the year -- Jesse correct me if I'm wrong, but to set all-time records for oil and NGL production in SACROC.","Jesse Arenivas","That's correct.","Steve Kean","It's a positive story in our view. Not a negative story at all. But where we have cut back and Steve has made this point I think where we have cut back as we were getting ready to ramp up the significantly to supply more CO2 to the market to our third-party customers.","And as prices of the commodity of the crude oil went down so much, we're still maintaining where we were in terms of demand for CO2 but we did not need to ramp up as quickly and that\u2019s mostly where the capital reductions in the CO2 segment have come from. ","Craig Shere","And while we're on the topic, I think the press release gave the very first disclosure for the early rise investment. I think that was kind of alluded to as potentially being big long-term in your last Analyst Day.","I understand that there's a major hurdle given where commodity prices are right now. But can -- given the early indications of this, are we on track to get anywhere close to kind of stimulation that you were hoping for. If we had $6 oil prices again, could this be as big as was discussed previously?","Steve Kean","Jesse?","Jesse Arenivas","Yeah. We still maintain a positive outlook. The volume, metrics, all the early indications are positive. The processing rates are little slower, but we're implementing a plan to speed that up. Phase II at this point seems economic. It is economic.","Going forward into Phase III and IV, as you start putting in more facilities, the processing were to play in to that. So we still believe that that\u2019s a viable project long-term. ","Craig Shere","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is open.","Steve Kean","Hi, Becca, how are you?","Becca Followill","I am good. Thank you. On Trans Mountain, can you talk a little bit about whether or not the -- with the push-ups the cost has changed and is there any kind of provision in there for the customers that it has to be done by a certain time or they have out in their contract? ","Steve Kean","Well, we have Ian Anderson, the President of Kinder Morgan, Canada here and he was waiting for the question. So\u2026","Ian Anderson","Sure. Thanks. You made my trip down worthwhile.","Becca Followill","I am so happy.","Ian Anderson","Let me answer it this way, as far as the cost go, we\u2019ve been reporting US$5.4 billion for the project for a number of quarters now and that is still a good forecast. The project was originally filed with the regulator as CAD5.4 projects if you convert the 5.4 American that\u2019s about 6.8 Canadian today.","And a few things have driven that both some scope changes to the project foreign exchange on non-Canadian source materials as well as the impact of the delay. So we add those three factors together the project is currently sitting on about a 6.8 Canadian forecast or about 5.4 U.S. that we have been reporting.","Becca Followill","Thank you. Thanks. It is fair to add them both from the standpoint of cost parameters and timing parameters we are well within the bounds of our contracts with our customers.","Ian Anderson","That\u2019s right. Contracts with the customers contemplate $6.8 billion capital to the project under which they've got no ability to de-contract their commitments so we're at that now and we're not hearing any pushback from shippers at this point in terms of their contractual commitments.","As far as the timing goes the only timing out that there is it that we don't have a regulatory decision and approval by the end of 2017. We'll be well within that. The regulator is going to issue their decision as Steve pointed out in May 2016. So we're well within the bounds of all the contract commitments we have both from a cost standpoint and a timing standpoint.","Becca Followill","That's very helpful. Thank you. But just to clarify so if it does go over the $6.8 billion cap that provides the out for some of the customers.","Steve Kean","If we present a toll to our customers that is reflective of a cost in excess of 6.8 that gives them the out.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Kean","And that's an important distinction.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you. And then on your Northeast pipelines not so much the Northeast Direct with some of the other pipelines that are more producer driven, some of the producers it now have a lot of access ST.","Any pushback with some of the customers to say, well I signed up for the contract, but I don't really need it now and can you let me get out of it or can we defer the timing of it?","Steve Kean","I think we are seeing incremental interest for capacity declining to some extent in some areas. But clearly any commitments they've made the date we're standing behind and we're not seeing any issues in that regard.","Becca Followill","But no producers have approach you to maybe push things out?","Steve Kean","Not to this point. No.","Becca Followill","Okay. And then finally on Aldo. What is the timing for an FID on that?","Steve Kean","It's already FID.","Rich Kinder","It is FID. So I think as you get the final FERC approval, it's good to go.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Hartz Capital. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, or maybe you I should say good evening everyone. Quick question, a little bit out in left field. I was just curious on TransMountain any other ideas you have brewing up there in Canada, with this week's election how that might impact your thinking or your operations up there knowing that you have a 100% controlled governments now by the Liberal party up there?","Steve Kean","I\u2019ll let Ian answer that.","Ian Anderson","I am wearing my Liberal red tie. It's to let early to speculate what a Liberal governmental is going to mean for us. We're going to continue to focus on the NED process that we are involved in all of the requirements of this while we continue our project planning and preparation.","We will certainly be briefing the Liberal government in due course on the project and the progress we've made. But I don't yet have any comment on what a Liberal government may do to us with respect to the project. We will just keep working very hard to keep them informed and plan to execute the project as soon as we get approval.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, John. How are you?","John Edwards","Doing well, Rich. Thanks. Just if I could on the dividend growth outlook and knowing the past you have indicated kind of a fill-in amount of capital expenditures to meet the longer-term objective.","And if memory serves me I think it was something like I want to say six -- it had been like a 10 and it came down. And with the revised kind of growth range, what -- how should we be thinking about what kind of fill in capital projects would be needed to meet I guess -- the new objectives?","Rich Kinder","I think you should think we're -- capital objectives that we'd always had John, and as Steve said earlier, we are on track to do that with our backlog with what we've already brought in service if you didn\u2019t look at what our original goals were for Project Fusion.","We're tracking that pretty well. It's the commodity price that has been the negative in the Project Fusion assumptions. So I don't think you would read anything into this that our capital program would change and we are still looking to continue to grow.","John Edwards","Okay. And so then, so longer term should we be thinking about a range six to 10 longer term range or kind of paralleling 16. Is that correct?","Kim Dang","Okay. Let me, I\u2019m\u2026","John Edwards","Sorry, Kim, I know it\u2019s been -- you\u2019ve gone over it a bunch of times. Just to be clear.","Kim Dang","I'm going to try one more time.","John Edwards","Okay.","Kim Dang","So, '16 we haven't gone through our budget yet. But we're giving ourselves a range because we haven't been through the budget. There is a fair amount of uncertainty. We know people are going to want an update.","Over the longer term what we think, what we -- I said earlier is we did fusion, we thought we could grow at 10% per year. We had a substantial excess coverage. What this energy market has done is it has essentially depleted that excess coverage. And so now we think that we probably can't grow at 10% longer term, but that the coverage would be very tight and could be negative in some years.","And so what we\u2019re saying is that as we go forward, we are going to have to look at what our coverage should be and what the dividend should be given that the coverage has been depleted. But the underlying business can still achieve the 10% growth.","That is why Rich I think the capital assumption could not change the underlying assumptions in terms of the capital spend have not change on some of the volumes have deteriorated but oil price has deteriorated and that is what is driven the depletion in coverage.","John Edwards","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just lastly I hate to keep coming back to this, but just in terms of modeling the alternative financing. I mean should we be thinking about this as equity, as some kind of preferred, some kind of debt, or can you not to comment at all?","Kim Dang","We can't comment at this time.","Rich Kinder","It is equity. We have said that.","John Edwards","Okay. All right. And then lastly on Trans Mountain. Just to follow-up this question. There's only a cost up there is not a timing out. Is that correct?","Rich Kinder","What I said is there is a timing out if we don't have our certificate from the federal government and the regulator by the end of 2017.","John Edwards","Okay. Great. Thank you. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Corey Goldman with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon.","Corey Goldman","Good afternoon. How is it going?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Corey Goldman","Just a quick follow-up on Craig's question earlier about Palmetto. I think Steve last quarter you talked about how the DOT approval was not essential. Is that still the case or are you kind of going to the appeal process and take it from there.","Steve Kean","It is not a requirement that we have public a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Georgia DOT but our appeal is about considering to pursue that.","Corey Goldman","Got it. And then Kim is there an update to the hedges on the CO2 side that we can get? ","Kim Dang","Sure. On 2016 we're about 63% hedged at $72 a barrel. 2017 is about 58 at $73 a barrel. 2018 is 45% at $75 a barrel and 2019 is 24% at $66 a barrel.","Corey Goldman","Got it. That's really helpful. And then just the last one for me, it looks like natural gas pipelines just turning a little bit above what you guys were expecting and it sounds like a portion of that is attributable to Hiland, can you kind of talk about how the ramp is going there and how that's gauging versus your initial expectations when you first closed in February? ","Kim Dang","Yes. I think it is probably -- it\u2019s very close but probably just slightly under what we had anticipated for this current year. Now when we put our projections together for Hiland we gave them -- we gave the solar projections a pretty good haircut and we didn't assume low price recovery really at this year or next.","And so we gave ourselves some pretty good running room there. I think probably a little bit under on the revenue side and a little better on the cost side. That includes just operating costs, maintenance capital, and financing costs. We looked at it a couple of months ago and we were just a little bit over. I think we're now just a little bit under. ","Corey Goldman","Great. That's really helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we no longer have any questions on queue. I\u2019d now like to\u2026","Rich Kinder","Thank you everybody for bearing with us for an hour and a half of informative questions. And thank you and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. So that concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating you may now disconnect."],"12583":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

A. Davidson","Operator","Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of today's conference [Operator Instructions]. I would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time [Operator Instructions].","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Sheila. Before we begin as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call includes forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of KMI's and KML's earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","Before turning the call over to Steve Kean and the team, let me again offer few thoughts regarding what I would term our financial philosophy at Kinder Morgan. As you will hear from David Michaels, our CFO, KMI continues to generate large amounts of cash flow. In the second quarter alone, we generated over $1.1 billion of DCF. And that cash flow was growing with both our DCF and EBITDA increasing substantially for the second quarter compared with the same period in 2017, and in fact on a year-to-date comparison. So we have strong cash flow and it's growing. Cash from management and the board is to make certain of that cash is deployed wisely and productively.","As you know, we are doing these things; we're de-levering our balance sheet; we're funding our expansion CapEx with internally generated funds; we have increased our dividend with further announced substantial increases targeted to both 2019 and 2020; and we bought back shares. As stated in our earnings released today, we intend to use KMI\u2019s share of the proceeds from the sale of the Trans Mountain pipeline estimated approximately $2 billion to pay down debt.","In my opinion using our cash for any and all of the purposes I've mentioned benefits our shareholders. And we will continue to use that shareholder benefit analysis as the litmus test on how to deploy our future cash flow. Let me just assure you, we will not foolishly waste our most precious asset, which is the cash we generate each and every quarter. Steve?","Steve Kean","As usual, we will be updating you on both KMI and KML this afternoon, I am going to start with a high level update and outlook on KMI then turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give you an update on our segment performance. David Michaels, our CFO, will take you through the numbers. Now, I'll give you a high level update on KML and Dax will take you through the numbers and a couple of other topics on KML. And then we'll take your questions on both entities.","We had a successful quarter on KMI and KML. Starting with KMI, we are having a very strong year. We are well above plan for the second quarter of the first half of the year. We expect to end the year at or above our plan. Our leverage continues to go down and we are showing 9% improvement year-over-year in DCF per share for the quarter. Just as importantly what's driving much of that improvement is strong underlying fundamentals, particularly in U.S. natural gas where our volumes are up sharply year-over-year due to increasing U.S. supply and demand, including export demand. That drives value on our underlying assets, as well as creating opportunities for projects.","We expect those fundamental drivers to continue, and we are benefiting from it in our transportation and our sales business. In addition to being the nation's largest transporter of natural gas, we also own and operate the large collection of storage assets. The improving fundamentals have not yet driven up storage values, but we would expect to see that improve and contribute to our performance as well in the longer term. So, very good underlying operating performance and year-over-year growth.","We've been saying for a while now that we want our leverage metric to be at or below 5 times debt to EBITDA. We ended the second quarter at 4.9 times and that obviously is before closing the Trans Mountain sale at KML. Management of the Board view the proceeds KMI receives as a result of that transaction should be applied to further reduced KMI leverage giving us greater financial strength and flexibility. We believe it should also put us well on our way to upgrade [plant]. Getting to where we are today required intense focus by our whole team, focus on our day-to-day operations at maintaining cost and capital discipline without compromising the safety of our operations. It's also the result of improving performance in our business, which Kim will take you through.","On May 29th, KML announced that we have agreed to sell the Trans Mountain pipeline and the expansion project for CAD4.5 billion, or approximately $2 billion to KMI shares. We guided to a late Q3 or early Q4 close and agreed with the Canadian government on a restart of planning and construction activity to be funded by government recourse only credit facility.","Everything is progressing as we said then. We have obtained some of the required regulatory approvals and we're making progress on the remaining. We have set a KML shareholder meeting date of August 30 and we are still expecting that late Q3 or early Q4 close. We are having a good year.","I'll cover the negatives as well on KMI. First, we continue to weigh in on the FERC tax notice of proposed rulemaking. We continue to believe that the impact of that rule, even if it stays in its current form, will be mitigated and spread over time. We still estimate that the tax only impact of the rule is about $100 million annually if fully implemented. As an aside, the NOPR is not on the agenda for the July meeting. We don\u2019t have any special insight into why. We hope the commission will take, and we've been urging the commission to take more time to deliberate because this is a big issue and there clearly have been unintended consequences from it. We think the design of the 501-G form is flawed and will produce uninformative look at the appropriate cost of service for our assets. So if that process goes forward as is, everyone needs to keep that in mind as those forms come out.","Second, it\u2019s frustrating to see our strong fundamental economic performance this quarter overshadowed a bit by the impairment of our investment in gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma. These are not bad assets but they are not as well positioned as our other assets, for example, in the Bakken and the Haynesville. And we have better risk-adjusted return opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio, like the opportunities we\u2019re pursuing in the Permian. We will look at the alternatives, appropriate alternatives with respect to these particular assets. Also note that the value of our gathering and processing assets in the Bakken and the Haynesville is improving. But of course, you don\u2019t get to write those assets up.","Notwithstanding this non-cash accounting charge, we\u2019re having a very good year on the fundamental economics of our business. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kimberly Dang","Thanks Steve. Overall the segments were up 8% versus the second quarter of \u201917, so very strong performance. Natural gas had an outstanding quarter. Transport volumes on our large diameter pipes were up 3.5% Bcf a day that\u2019s 12%, driven by increased supply from the Permian and the DJ and growing demand in the form of exports to Mexico, increased power demand, projects placed in service and some cold weather that occurred early in the quarter. Overall, the higher utilization of our systems, a lot of which came without the need to spend significant capital, resulted in nice bottom line growth in the quarter, and in longer term will drive expansion opportunity if our pipes reach capacity.","Gas and crude gathering volumes were up 7% and 19% respectively, driven by higher production in the Bakken and the Haynesville, slightly offset by lower volumes in the Eagle Ford. On the project side, in natural gas, we had a few noteworthy developments during the quarter. Since we discussed Gulf Coast Express in this call last quarter, we\u2019re contracted the 6% of remaining capacity and the pipeline is now 100% subscribed. Right away acquisition is in process with mainline construction anticipated to start in October of this year and in service still anticipated for October of 2019.","We announced a letter of intent with EagleClaw and Apache to jointly pursue development of the Permian Highway project, which is an approximately 2 billion 2 DCF project to move volumes from the Permian to the Texas Gulf Coast. Apache and EagleClaw will also be significant shippers on the site if we go forward. Finally, on our Elba liquefaction project, we now anticipate the in-service will be in the fourth quarter of this year, approximately a one quarter delay, but that impact is factored into our meet-or-exceed guidance for the year, which David will take you through.","Our CO2 segment benefited from higher crude volumes and higher NGL and CO2 prices. Net crude oil productions are up 4% versus the second quarter of 2017. SACROC volumes are up 6% versus last year and are 6% above planned year-to-date as we continue to find ways to extend the life of this deal. Currently, we\u2019re evaluating transitions and opportunities, as well as off unit opportunities that are adjacent to SACROC where we already own the mineral rights. Tall Cotton volumes were up versus last year but are below budget. For the full year, we anticipate overall crude production to be very close to plan.","Our net realized crude price is relatively flat for the quarter despite a higher WTI price as the increase in the Mid-Cush differential offset the increase in the WTI price. For the balance of the year, we have approximately 87% of the Mid-Cush differential debt. The Terminals business was up 3% benefiting from liquids expansion in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton, and the new Jones Act tankers that came online in 2017, and better volumes on the both side. These benefits were partially offset by weakness in the north east, particularly at our Staten Island facility that is now subject to New York spill tax, making that facility less economic versus the facilities in New Jersey.","Non-core -- divestitures as we have reoriented our business to core hub position and lower charter rates on our existing Jones Act portfolio. Bulk tonnage was up 16% in the quarter, driven primarily by coal and steel. Liquid volume was down -- liquids utilization was down approximately 4% due to Staten Island facility I mentioned earlier. In the product segment, we saw nice performance from our refined products business. Overall, refined product volumes were up 3%, well in excess of the EIA number. Here we benefited from a refinery outage in Salt Lake that positively impacted our volumes of Las Vegas. But even after accounting for that impact, volumes were still nicely above the EIA numbers.","On the crude and condensate side, volumes were up 5% as we saw nice volumes in the Bakken due to economic spreads and in the Eagle Ford as shippers work to meet minimum. Finally, on the product side, ethanol volumes were up 10% primarily due to expansion projects on our southeast terminals. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David Michaels to go through the numbers.","David Michaels","All right, thanks Kim. So today, we are declaring a dividend of $0.20 per share, which is consistent with last quarter's declaration, our 2018 budget, as well as the plan that we laid out for investors last July. The annualized $0.80 per share is what we expect to declare for the full year, and would represent 60% increase over the $0.50 per share that we declared for 2017. Importantly, as we noted in our budget, we continue to expect that the substantial cash flow we still -- we continue to expect substantial cash flows in excess of our dividend despite that robust increase year-over-year.","As you\u2019ve already heard, KMI had an excellent second quarter. Our performance was well above our budget and last year's second quarter. For the full year, as you\u2019ve already heard, we expect to meet or exceed our DCF budget. With that, I\u2019ll walk through the GAAP financials and then move to the DCF, the distributable cash flow financials, which is the way we primarily evaluate our performance. On our earnings, net loss attributable to common shareholders for the quarter is $180 million or negative $0.08 per share, which is a decrease of $517 million in total and $0.23 per share versus the second quarter of 2017. More than all of that decrease came as a result of after-tax expenses of $647 million, which we categorize as certain items.","For those of you who follow us know we define certain items as those items that are recorded in GAAP that are non-cash or occur sporadically, and are not representative of our business\u2019 ongoing cash generating capability. Certain items this quarter were driven by $600 million impairment of certain gathering and processing assets in Oklahoma, which Steve already mentioned. So looking at the earnings, adjusted for those certain items, the $180 million net loss would be a net income of $459 million, which is $155 million or 51% higher than the adjusted earnings of the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is $0.21 or $0.07 and 50% higher than that in the second quarter last year.","And moving on to DCF, DCF per share is $0.50, up $0.04 or 9% higher versus the second quarter of 2017. Total DCF of $1,117 million is up $95 million or 9% above last year's quarter. This very nice increase in DCF was driven primarily by the greater contributions from our natural gas and product segments, as well as favorable cash taxes, partially offset by higher G&A costs, interest expense and sustaining capital. Overall, the segments were up 8% or $137 million with natural gas up 11% quarter-over-quarter, contributing $96 million of that total improvement.","Natural gas segment benefited in multiple areas; Highland and Kinder Hawk assets were driven by increased volumes from the Bakken and Hanesville; EP&G and NGPL benefited from Permian supply growth; our Texas Intrastate were up on greater volumes and margin; and our TGP asset was up due to expansion in the projects placed in service. The products segment was up $28 million or 10%, driven by greater contributions from Plantation, Cochin in our KMST assets. G&A is higher $11 million due to timing of certain expenses. As you can see, we're about flat from last year on a year-to-date basis. Interest expense is $9 million higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by higher interest rates, which are more than offsetting the benefit of a lower balance.","Income attributable to non-controlling interest is higher by $13 million when you add the NCI change with the change in the NCI share of certain items, and that was driven by the IPO of our Canadian assets last May. Cash taxes are a benefit of $15 million, driven by lower taxes due to the tax reform benefiting our subsidiary cash taxpayers. Sustaining capital was approximately $7 million higher than the second quarter of last year. We budgeted for this, we\u2019ve budgeted for sustaining capital for 2018 to be higher than 2017. And we're actually running a bit favorable relative to plan year-to-date, so that is expected to be offset by higher capital spending in the second half of the year.","So to summarize, the segments are up $137 million, offset by the $13 million for non-controlling interest. Cash taxes are favorable by $15 million, offset by $11 million of higher G&A costs and $16 million of the combined increase in interest expense and sustaining capital. Those items altogether sum to $112 million increase in DCF versus $95 million on the page, but there are other moving pieces but that gets you the big picture. 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year.","We expect DCF for the full year to meet or exceed our budget, driven by better than planned performance from our natural gas and CO2 segments, lower cash taxes and lower G&A costs, somewhat offset by the sale of our Trans Mountain assets, which we expect to close later this year. Higher interest expenses due again to the higher LIBOR rates and lower performance in our liquids terminals business, primarily in the northeast. And one final note, the natural gas is -- while natural gas is ahead of plan year-to-date and is expected to finish the year ahead of plan, the segment expects to be impacted relative to budget in the second half of the year by the delayed in service of our Elba Island LNG project, which Kim mentioned.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 4.9 times debt to that EBITDA, which is a nice improvement from last quarter and year end, which were both at 5.1 times. This quarter\u2019s metric was benefit some by timing as we expect greater spend in the second half relative to the first. However, we anticipate that greater spend will be more than offset by the impact from the close of Trans Mountain sale. Excluding the impact from the Trans Mountain sale, we would expect to end the year below our budget of 5.1 times.","Net debt ended the quarter at 36.6 billion and that includes the 50% share of the KML preferred equity that\u2019s $11 million lower than year end and $342 million lower than the end of the first quarter. To reconcile the quarter change, the $342 million lower net debt; we generated $1,117 million of distributable cash flow; we paid out $621 million of growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures; we paid out $442 million of dividend; and we had a working capital source of cash of $288 million, the largest item of which is accrued interest and that reconciles to the $342 million reduction in debt for the quarter. From year end, the $11 million lower net debt to reconcile that we generated $2,364 million of distributable cash flow; we paid out $1,266 million in growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures; and paid $719 million in dividend; we repurchased 250 million of shares in the first quarter; and we had a working capital use of cash of $118 million, mostly due to bonus property tax payment in first quarter.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","So turning to KML and the big news during the quarter of course is the $4.5 million Canadian Trans Mountain sale transaction. As we said at the time of the announcement, the sales price amounts to about CAD12 per KML share. And on top of that, we have a strong set of remaining midstream assets in an entity with very limited debt and with opportunities for continued investment and expansion, as well as the potential for a strategic combination. We are laser focused right now on closing this transaction and that process is going well. The KML board will be reviewing the use of proceeds alternatives and will provide further guidance on that as we advance the transaction to close. Again also consistent with what we said the day we announced the transaction.","As pointed out in the release, while all options are on the table, we generally don't view it as attractive to KML shareholders for us to sit on a big pile of cash while management hunts around for a transaction to use it on. So we are strongly indicating there I think that we\u2019re going to look for the best alternative for KML shareholders and that's what we\u2019re going to work through with the KML board.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Dax to take you through the numbers and couple of other topics.","Dax Sanders","Thanks Steve. Before I get into the results, I want to make a few general comments around KML. At this point, we expect to sale Tran Mountain -- as we said, we\u2019ll close at the end of the third quarter beginning in the fourth, following the necessary regulatory approvals. The transaction will obviously result in significant proceeds of approximately $4.2 billion after tax, and we will update you on how we plan to use those proceeds following the KML shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. As we said in the press release, given that we\u2019re divesting of a material piece of KML, we\u2019re retracting the previous guidance that we provided and we\u2019ll provide an updated guidance, including more granular information on the earnings power of remaining assets around the time the transaction close.","With respect to the future of KML, while the primary reason we setup KML which was to be a standalone entity for funding TMX, is no longer relevant, KML will remain a viable company after the sale of TM closes as residual assets are strong fee based assets. Having said that, the KML Board will be evaluating all of the options for KML and all of the options are on the table.","Now moving towards results. Today, the KML Board declared a dividend for the second quarter of $0.1625 per restricted voting share or $0.65 annualized, which is consistent with our budget and previous guidance. Earnings per restricted voting share for the third quarter of 2018 are approximately $0.02, derived from approximately $13.7 million net income, which is down approximately $1.4 million or 45% versus the same quarter in '17.","Stronger revenue associated with the Base Line Tank and Terminal assets coming online, incremental equity at AEDC associated with Trans Mountain spending and a one-time gain associated with the sale of a small asset was offset by incremental interest expense resulting from write off of unamortized cost associated with the canceled Trans Mountain construction facility. In addition in the second quarter of 2017, we recognized foreign exchange loss associated with the intercompany loans that were settled at the time of the IPO such as the loss does not recur in 2018.","Adjusted earnings which excludes certain items, were approximately $54 million compared to approximately $36 million in the second quarter of 2017. During the second quarter, there were three certain products; the first was the $60 million write-off of the unamortized issuance cost for the cancelled Trans Mountain construction facility that I mentioned; the second was roughly $3 million of expenses associated with Trans Mountain sale; and the third was $9 million gain associated with the sales of small assets that I mentioned.","Total DCF for the quarter is $91.8 million, which is up $12.4 million from the comparable period in 2017, but unfavorable to our budget by approximately $7 million. That provides coverage of approximately $10 million and reflects a DCF payout ratio of approximately 63%. The primary reason for the negative variance of budget was that we actually budgeted for the gain on the sale of the assets that I mentioned, and that was treated as a certain item. While we normally don\u2019t budget for certain items, we did budget for this gain. However, after we achieved the gain, we decided that given one-time nature of the transaction, which is treated as certain item excluding the DCF.","Looking at the components of the DCF variance. segment EBITDA before certain items is up $19.6 million compared to Q2 2017 with the pipeline segment up approximately $14.7 million, and the Terminal segment up approximately $4.9 million. The pipeline segment was higher, primarily due to higher AEDC associated with spending on the project and slightly favorable O&M. The Terminal segment was higher, primarily due to the Base Line Tank and Terminal project assets coming into service and higher contract revenues and renewals at the North [Line] terminal. On the Base Line Terminal project, we placed six of the 12 tanks into service during the first and second quarter. We expect that four of the remaining tanks will go into service in the third quarter with the final two coming in the fourth quarter.","G&A is higher by $3.3 million due primarily to higher costs associated with being a public company. Lower interest costs and higher preferred dividends largely offset each other. Sustaining capital was unfavorable by approximately $1.8 million compared to 2017 with higher spending on Trans Mountain, offset by lower spending in the terminals. Cash taxes increased by $1.5 million over the same quarter of 2017. We were not required to make estimated cash tax payments in 2017, but did make payment into Q2 meaningfully.","With that, I will move onto the balance sheet comparing the year end 2017 to 6\/30. Cash decreased approximately $12 million, which is due to $144 million of DCF, excluding AEDC\u2019s of $25 million which is non-cash plus $247 million of net borrowing proceeds plus $4 million of working capital other source of cash, offset by $322 million of cash paid for expansion capital and $85 million of distributions net for proceeds. Other current assets increased approximately $26 million, primarily due to an increase in prepaid property tax associated with mid-year payments. PP&E increased $357 million, primarily due to spending on the expansion project. Deferred charges and other assets decreased approximately $60 million as a result of write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with facility that I mentioned.","On the right hand side of the balance sheet, total debt increased from zero to $247 million with the $247 million being sum of the approximately $115 million and $132 million line items you see. The approximately $133 million is the balance of the new $500 million working capital facility that replaced the canceled TMEP construction and working capital facility and represents debt that will stay with KML following the closing of the transaction. The approximately $115 million is the balance on the facility that we put in place with Government of Canada upon construction of the project and on the government\u2019s behalf for May 31st until the transaction close.","The debt will go with the asset to the Government of Canada without purchase price adjustment. In other words, KML will not be responsible for repayment of this debt. Other current liabilities increased by almost $62 million, primarily due to an increase in TM expansion approvals as well as income taxes payable. Other long-term liabilities increased by approximately $36 million, primarily due to the receipt of [Western] stock premiums from shippers.","Finally, I want to offer a couple of comments on expansion capital. On the Base Line Terminal project, we\u2019ve now spent approximately 324 million of our shares and $375 million project total with approximately $51 million less spend in 2018. And we\u2019ll note that the 375 million total has been revised now from 398 million, primarily as a result of general cost savings. On the Trans Mountain expansion, we spent approximately $1.25 billion as of 5\/31, which is the day that the government started to pick-up the tabs and another $41 million in June at government\u2019s account for total spend of approximately [$1.2 million] as of June 30th.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, thanks. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the line to questions on both KMI and KML.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Your line is open.","Colton Bean","So just to follow up on the comments around KML there. So following the close of the Trans Mountain sale, you\u2019ve highlighted the possibility of being acquisitive in the Canadian market. Given some of the recent deals and valuations we\u2019ve seen though, would you consider further divestitures if the interest is there?","Steve Kean","Yes. We\u2019ll look. We will look at, again, all of the options. I mean, when you\u2019re talking specifically about M&A, I think there are couple of considerations. Number one, this is an attractive set of midstream assets and it does fit well with other entities. Number two, we\u2019re coming out of this with very limited debt on the balance sheet, which gives us capacity even with a distribution of the proceeds. When you say divestitures that -- an asset divestiture, probably doesn\u2019t make sense from a tax standpoint, probably doesn't make sense from a business integration standpoint. We\u2019ve got a good set of relatively integrated assets remaining with the KML entity. But we\u2019ll look at all of the alternatives and including strategic combination.","Colton Bean","Let me get to switching gears to the Permian Highway. So on PHP, the base design calls for a 42-inch pipeline. You also noted the possibility for 48-inch line. We\u2019ve seen some projects propose with a similar diameter with up to 5 Bcf day of capacity. Are there any physical limitations that would prevent that level of compression on PHP, or is it more a question on commercial support?","Steve Kean","I don\u2019t know how you get to 5 Bcf on a 48-inch, it\u2019s pretty powered up -- 48-inch fully powered up, 48-inch is about 2.7 roughly. That might be not -- so I\u2019m not clear what context that\u2019s in. but look I think on PHP, the customer sign ups and customer interest has been coming very fast. And when you think about -- it's just the fourth quarter last year that we signed up a two Bcf pipeline project going from the Permian to our Texas Intrastate system, and now we\u2019re in advanced stages on a second one of similar potentially larger size.","It\u2019s really incredible and I think speaks to two things; one is the robust growth and the production out of the Permian; but secondly, the value of our downstream network in terms of giving customers good alternatives to get their gas to Houston market, power demand, petrochemical as well as LNG and Mexico exports. So we\u2019re proceeding on that, we didn\u2019t put it in the backlog, we\u2019re not ready to FID. But we think sometime in this current quarter that we\u2019re in right now, we could have more to say about that.","Colton Bean","And so the 2.7 area. Is there any work that you\u2019d have to do on the downstream side of this, thinking more so along the Gulf Coast as you\u2019re connecting into the legacy system?","Steve Kean","Yes, there is some. It brings a lot of gas into the network. And so there is some downstream debottlenecking that would take place to make sure that we get that gas dished off to valuable markets.","Colton Bean","I guess just one last one here. So you highlighted incremental capacity sales for the Permian systems. Are you seeing any pricing power with regard to negotiated rates on either KM Texas or maybe El Paso as legacy contracts roll off there?","Steve Kean","Yes, one important distinction here, so our Texas Intrastate system is not a FERC regulated asset, that\u2019s important to know. And I think we are generally doing -- I'll turn it over to Tom to answer on the intrastate pipelines, generally doing negotiated rate transactions.","Tom Martin","Negotiated rate transactions and really I think we\u2019re seeing, both on EPNG, NGPL as well, opportunities to -- have very very attractive negotiated rate deals for at least the two to three year period. So some of these other projects, where projects come in to service and in some instances longer term than that, so lot of demand for capacity to get out of the Permian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Tonet","Just continuing with the Permian here, and just want to check. Is there any opportunities left in EPNG, NGPL, Texas Intrastate kind of squeeze out any other incremental capacity? Or you guys fully tapped out on that side?","Steve Kean","We\u2019re continuing to expand on all three of those systems. We\u2019ve been doing some external and we are looking at others as well.","Jeremy Tonet","I guess how much -- how big these deals, are they small or could that be notable that some -- it looks like there is some big constrains coming up. And I\u2019m just wondering how much opportunity there?","Steve Kean","So Jeremy, starting with Texas, that\u2019s the biggest piece, because if you look at the overall U.S. market, the higher value market is on the Texas Gulf Coast now. And putting aside New England for a moment, I mean, in terms of just the absolute basis differentials, you have a depressed price in the Permian in West Texas and you have a very strong price in the Houston Ship Channel, because that\u2019s -- Houston Ship Channel as well as the rest of the Gulf Coast, because that\u2019s where all the incremental demand is.","So all the gas, including gas from the Northeast, including gas down the Gulf Coast line of NGPL, including gas on brand new build pipelines that Tom and his team are working on they\u2019re trying to get to our system and others in the Texas Gulf Coast. And so the biggest chunk by far is the 2 Bcf project that we are actively building as well as 2.7 Bcf project that we've got in advance development.","Jeremy Tonet","It seems like you\u2019ve been ahead of those pipelines coming online there could be big bottlenecks, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s like 100 mcf or is bigger or smaller. Just trying to feel like how much we could see there, because there is concern that the production of gas in West Texas, if there\u2019s not enough takeaway that could impede production growth rate?","Steve Kean","Yes, there continue to be bottlenecks and the infrastructure is trying to catch up to that now. And if you look at long-term within all these projections, they\u2019re going to be subject to debate. But if you look at long-term projection, there is a long-term protection for a continued strong basis between the Permian and the Houston Ship Channel, and that's a consequence of just expected continued growth in oil and associated gas production. So we\u2019re trying to help our customers by de-bottlenecking those constraints a bit, but the growth in production continues to make those constraints and those differentials fairly persistent, which is a good thing for a company and the business that\u2019s moving the stuff from place-to-place. And it\u2019s also a good thing that we have, essentially with our assets, we lap the part of the market that's really growing in terms of demand on the Texas Gulf Coast and even Louisiana.","Jeremy Tonet","And then I guess just looking at the balance sheet, and if you are able to get $2 billion of cash move from KML to KMI what type of target leverage are you looking for? You said you could be on uplift for upgrade there. Would you look to buy back bonds or keep cash in the balance sheet for projects? And how does this play into the buyback program, how much have you executed there?","Steve Kean","Yes, I think what we\u2019re telling you, of all the alternatives that Rich has talked about in terms of the use of cash, we\u2019re trying to give you some guidance here that we think the best use of that is as particular instances to further de-lever, to further reduce our leverage. And so that's what we intend to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re telling you today.","Jeremy Tonet","So do you have\u2026","Steve Kean","As opposed to buybacks or something else.","Jeremy Tonet","Do you have a targeted leverage ratio that you\u2019re looking to get to at this point? And is there room still left on your authorized buyback program?","Kimberly Dang","Jeremy, KML hasn\u2019t said exactly what it\u2019s going to do with the proceeds. You\u2019ve heard today that Steve said that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to set our cash in expectation of a hypothetical acquisition. So we\u2019re waiting on KML\u2019s decision. KMI has said, once we receive whatever proceeds we receive, we\u2019re going to use to pay down debt. And so I think there is -- once we have the answer to that, we will update you to the extent that we change any of our leverage metrics at that time. Today, we are not changing our 5 times or better leverage metrics.","Rich Kinder","And obviously it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that if you are reducing your debt by $2 billion or something in that range, that will have a material impact on the ratio.","Kimberly Dang","It would be well below 5 times?","Rich Kinder","It would be well below 5 times and at that time is when we would share any resulting targets.","Jeremy Tonet","And one last one if I could, the ENI arbitration ruling. Is that an NPV neutral event for you guys, or any more color you can share there?","Steve Kean","Not a lot more color than what we have in the press release. It's under a confidentiality arrangement. For disclosure purposes we can state essentially what we've stated here, which is that we had a result, the result was termination of the contract but also substantial cash award to Gulf LNG.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Just a couple from me, the first one is I've had a number of clients with concerns about your Permian Highway Pipeline partners\u2019 ability to fund their share of the project. Could this be a possible show stopper, or would Kinder Morgan be willing to take a larger share if it came to that assuming the customer contracts were there?","Steve Kean","It's an attractive project to us and so we would take a larger share of that [indiscernible] an issue, we don't expect it to be an issue though.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And then now that your debt is below 5x and U.S. oil prices and production have recovered, it seems like there's more room than in the past to sell non-core assets and reshape your portfolio a bit. When you look at your asset base, do you see a benefit in trimming in some areas where you don't have a huge presence? Are you pretty happy with your portfolio as is and perhaps even view the diversity as a benefit?","Steve Kean","Generally, very happy with the portfolio that we have. We do continue to look at those things, so where they make sense. And John and his team in terminals have, over a couple of years, they've pruned the assets to get his business lined up more towards the things that are the real hub positions, as well as really strong positions in the bulk business. Tom has done a bit of that too, mentioned Oklahoma G&P that's not necessarily divesture for a JV or other alternatives we'll look at there, so we'll continue to look at it.","Jean Ann Salisbury","So may be a bit about around the edges, but not a strong desire for changes?","Steve Kean","I think that's fair.","Operator","The next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Just a couple of questions and some of them are re-asking some of the other questions that have been previously asked, but first just starting with the TMX proceeds. So you clearly outlined that you're going to pay down debt, that's the first priority right now. Given the fact that a chunky pay down of debt, but as you said you know, it would be materially below. When we think about 2019, 2020 and so forth, in a scenario where operating cash flows after fully funding CapEx and the dividend, in the past I think in your analyst day this year, you had said I think it was $565 million was available to buy back shares. Would that be the approach that you would take between \u201919 and beyond that if there's cash available after funding CapEx and dividends out of operating cash flow that you would then direct it towards that? Or would you still want to get meaningfully below the chunky pay down of debt that you're indicating right now?","Steve Kean","I don't know what you mean by chunky pay down paying down debt is paying down debt, Shneur. So once we have reached our targeted level of debt, which as Kim said we will share with you, once the distribution of proceeds is finalized then I think we can give you a clear roadmap to where we\u2019ll be in the future. But our thought on this is we\u2019re de-levering, we\u2019re strengthening the overall portfolio of the Company in that respect. And as I said in my opening remarks, that still gives us the opportunity to do all these other things, all of which benefit the shareholders.","We\u2019ve already plugged in and anticipated substantial additional increase in dividend. We bought back 500 million worth of stock. We can do more of either one of those. And obviously, we will continue to fund our expansion CapEx internally. So it just gives us a lot more runway I think on a going forward basis, which we can share with you after that distribution is made.","Shneur Gershuni","And so maybe two follow-up questions, first one follow-up on the Permian infrastructure. You sounded like you have some de-bottlenecking opportunities, and it sounds like some compression here and there and so forth that can give a couple hundred [indiscernible] day of new capacity. But at the same time, the plan is to bring on cost [down] [ph] you expressed here, you\u2019re talking about potentially PHP. I mean, how do you balance between spending capital to debottleneck for what would be addressing a short-term issue versus cannibalizing a longer-term issue. Can we expect that these types of debottlenecking capital projects have a much lower multiple in terms of expected returns? I am just trying to understand how you balance those types of items.","Steve Kean","Yes, those are very -- they're very attractive returns, but we don't -- we do both. And I think the other thing that came up in our opening remarks but I want to emphasize here is the value that having that increased production and really the increase in supply and demand that we\u2019re seeing across our network what that does to our existing system. So even without expansion, [without] [ph] deploying capital, even small capital investments, we\u2019re seeing the value of existing capacity improve and increase.","People used to move on EPNG to the hub for free, and then aggregated for a downstream move. Now, those little bits of capacities are all valuable and we\u2019re getting value for them. And so it\u2019s small projects like you say that are often done at very attractive multiple. It's bigger projects like Gulf Coast Express that are done at also attractive returns, but clearly not the multiple you can get for some of the smaller capital projects. But it's also an uplift to the value of our existing network.","Kimberly Dang","And just one follow-up on that, to the extent that it is a short-term opportunity, because those volumes will ultimately move on Gulf Coast Express or on Permian Highway, we're taking that into account in our economics that we run to the extent that the short-term opportunities require capital. As Steve said, they don\u2019t always require capital.","Shneur Gershuni","So, just to paraphrase, effectively these short-term projects are high return projects but you also get operating leverage downstream from those projects, which I assume you would also have operating leverage once Gulf Coast Express and PHP come online. Is that the right way to characterize it?","Steve Kean","Yes, I think that's fair.","Shneur Gershuni","And one final question, just a follow-up on the pruning of assets. When you think about even what has traditionally been labeled as core. Are there any plans or any thoughts to further evaluate all of your segments? CO2 has always been one that investors have wondered. If that\u2019s something that you're committed to a longer-term basis, has anything changed as you\u2019ve gone through this evolution over the last two to three years?","Steve Kean","CO2 is a good business for us. We have a scarce resource in the CO2 itself. We\u2019ve got the infrastructure to get that to enhance oil recovery fields. We own the enhanced oil recovery fields. We also do for third party sales for CO2. And we've got a good EOR team that knows how to turn that CO2 into high returns for the capital that we deploy there. We are shareholder driven company and whether it\u2019s little things or big things, we\u2019re going to look at what the best alternative and outcome is for our shareholders. But I think all of those things make this a business that we are happy to hold.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Tom Abrams","I just wanted to make sure I understood the Canadian thought process, because if the money stays at KML, it improves your balance sheet. If it\u2019s the dividend to you it improves your balance sheet. The part of the uncertainty is if it\u2019s used to make an acquisition then that that impacts your targeting or your debt level, if you will. And so without knowing what you're going to do with proceeds, if you\u2019re going to go joint venture or not or something like that, you really can't indicate what your overall debt level is going to be. Is that about right?","Steve Kean","Well, no, not exactly. So Tom, the concerns you have about well, if the cash is diverted into an acquisition, I think you have to think about that as that\u2019s very rare. And the other thing is because corporate transactions, you can't project them and you can't predict them, they come together if they come together only when a lot of factors come together. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re saying what we\u2019re saying. We don\u2019t think that shareholders, KML shareholders, appreciate management just sitting on the cash and saying, wait for me to do something with it as opposed to having the cash in hand so that they can do something with it.","But as we said all options are on the table, we\u2019re going to talk to the KML Board about it and think about the best strategic alternatives, as well as the best way to use proceeds. This is a significant amount of money. This is a great problem to have. It's $12 per share for KML and we want to make sure that we handle that, and KML wants to make sure that it gets handled in the best way for our shareholders. We\u2019re going to take some time to think, for example, about tax impacts on the shareholders who would receive cash or receive it in the form of buybacks, for example. There are some differences there. We want to understand those. And it\u2019s a big piece of this company, so we want to be thoughtful about it. But the good news and the very good news is that we\u2019ve got a transaction that once we close it provides a substantial amount of cash and we\u2019ve got a very good problem to have which is what\u2019s the best way to deploy it.","Tom Abrams","Couple of other questions real quick ones. First, any steel tariff issues slowing procurement, slowing timelines on projects?","Steve Kean","I think we\u2019re in good shape on Gulf Coast Express. And steel is something that we\u2019re looking very closely at and we will be working very hard on, making sure that we've got adequate sources of pipe for the 42 and the 48 inch. And there is a distinction between those two diameters. There are fewer suppliers for the 48 than the 42, and normally this would not be a consideration. But the steel tariffs are enough to make us spend some extra time to make sure that we\u2019ve got a clear supply chain that gets that pipe to us at a predictable price and on time. And so it has an effect, it\u2019s created uncertainty, there is no question about it. And so it's an uncertainty that we are actively managing and working on. But we're in good shape on Gulf Coast Express.","Tom Abrams","And then I wanted to ask about this Jupiter crude project and they're advertising you as one of their benefits, because of connectivity to Corpus and Houston, as they had [head] [ph] down the Brownsville. But they're also looking for a joint venture partner. And I was wondering if that project appeals to you at all?","Steve Kean","It's not one that we've talked about or thought about.","Tom Abrams","And then the last question is on the terminalling in New York. Is that something that's going to linger for the next couple of quarters at least? I think that continue to run off, if you will, and you won't have -- am asking if you\u2019ll have offsets to for instance new tankers coming into the fleet or better volume somewhere else\u2026","Steve Kean","We have the Base Line project that will be coming on, but yes, it will be lingering of our 3.6 million barrels that are unutilized right now. 900,000 is just tanks that are out for repair and API inspection, leaves you 2.8 left. 2 million of that is in Staten Island, and [indiscernible] associated with a steel tax issue that was implemented a couple of years ago that they rescinded the ability to have a rebate on. And so that has created a hole in our ability to release the tank. We are 100% utilized in Houston. We're 100% utilized in Edmonton, Vancouver and in other locations. But we do have an issue at Staten Island that will linger on until we can get that resolved.","Kimberly Dang","And that's taken into account in our guidance for the full year of when we say that we\u2019ll meet or exceed [indiscernible].","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Keith Stanley","On KML, are there any hurdles or concerns or tax issues that KMI would face, if they elected to [indiscernible] KML in once the sale is completed? Or is that a relatively straightforward thing to do if you went that route?","Steve Kean","I don't think there are any incremental complications associated with it. So I don't think there would be. And again, I think just to highlight what we said, all options are on the table.","Keith Stanley","Back to KMI, any material additions to the growth backlog during the quarter?","Steve Kean","The growth backlog was roughly flat when you look at projects added and projects placed in service. And again, that's without obviously the Trans Mountain change. But we continue to find good opportunities and work on good -- and obviously, it does not include Permian, the Permian Highway Pipeline project. We continue to find good opportunities in gas, some incremental opportunities in CO2 and some small expansion opportunities in our refined products in liquids terminals business.","Keith Stanley","And one last quick clarification, just when you say you\u2019re in good shape on GCX on the steel tariffs, do you have an exemption request out I think for the pipes for that project?","Steve Kean","We do, and we have an arrangement with our supplier that will resolve our ability to continue to get the pipe. And so that's why I say, I think we're going to be all right on the pipeline of GCX. We got domestic suppliers as well as -- it's actually more than half domestic produced pipe for GCX. And then I think we're going to be able to get -- we are getting the pipe from the foreign supplier.","Operator","The next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open. ","Darren Horowitz","Steve, I just want to go back to the Permian Highway real quick. You mentioned the operating leverage downstream of the pipe. We can all see the opportunity either at Katy, or Agua Dulce, or Coastal Bend or even in the Tejas but from your perspective, what's the best ROIC for you to physically take those hydrocarbons beyond those points, those receipt points or delivery points to provide even a further increase net back to customers over the long-term? And then as you guys think about capacity commitments on that line, recognizing the intrastate asset systems over 7 Bcf, you got over 130 Bcf of storage connecting between this and possibly GCX. How much capacity on PHP do you want to have just for the Texas Intrastate business under the scenario like you said theoretically basis should be wider for longer?","Steve Kean","So first of all, when we make the arrangements with our customers, they get downstream connectivity with that deal. Now, downstream connectivity is on our network. And so I think the right way to think about that Darren is we\u2019ve got about 5 Bcf a day system there today. And with Gulf Coast Express, we're bringing another 2 to it. And with Permian Highway potentially another 2 on top of that or potentially more coming into that system, and demand growing to soak it up. And so that puts us right at the center of the traffic between the biggest growing supply resource and the fastest growing market. And that's a good place to be in terms of enhancing our transportation values, our opportunity to purchase gas. And we do have some purchased gas on Gulf Coast Express to feed our sales business there and as well as on storage. So it\u2019s just a good -- it\u2019s a very good position for us to be in.","Darren Horowitz","Steve, when you guys look at the amount of Permian supply growth converging on Waha and the impact to basis beyond an upscale Permian Highway and GCX, how much incremental pipe capacity do you think is necessary to keep pace with supply growth?","Steve Kean","If you look at the projections in the Permian, there's still more to come. And what the best ways are to debottleneck and versus new build I think still remains to be seen. And are people really willing yet to sign up for long-term commitments that would fully commit a third pipeline, it's unclear. But right now, we've got a pretty good looking opportunity on a second pipeline for us out of the Permian.","Operator","The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tristan Richardson","Just a question on the strong performance in midstream. Can you talk about new project so far this year up north in the Bakken and prospects for further capacity additions there?","Steve Kean","Yes, we have a lot of, I think $300 million worth of projects up in the Bakken that expand our gathering system up there, both crude and gas, looking at other opportunities to grow with our major producer there Continental. And I think longer term, and there is likely to be a need to have a residue outlet on the transmission site, which we are certainly trying to take a look at that as well. So a lot of growth, a lot of opportunity up there and we feel really good about our position.","Tristan Richardson","And then just one small clarification on the PH project as you guys firm up the potential scope there. The timing you guys have talked about, is that independent of the diameter you end up choosing?","Steve Kean","Yes, it\u2019s about a year later essentially than Gulf Coast Express, so fourth quarter of 2020.","Operator","The next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Dennis Coleman","A few really just follow-ups, starting with PHP. As you move the project forward, it sounds like we can expect to hear something maybe pretty quickly, moving I guess towards FID. Is that what I'm hearing?","Steve Kean","Yes, it looks like it's coming together in Q3. Now, as always, it comes with a caveat that sometimes we\u2019re dependent upon -- the customer is going to get some - a Board authorization or something else. And so sometimes those schedules can drift on us. But in terms of the demand and the seriousness of the demand, it's coming together fairly quickly in the quarter that we\u2019re sitting in.","Dennis Coleman","And in terms of other shippers coming onto the line. Are they also chunky shippers like your anchors where they might be asking for participation, is that a possibility?","Steve Kean","Potentially, there is some still -- there's a very big chunk still out there to get. And we would look at each of those deals individually, just like we do right now. I mean, we like own and operating this project, as well as Gulf Coast Express but on the right terms, we would consider it as we did.","Dennis Coleman","I guess, if I can shift to KML again and just make sure I'm again understanding all the things you\u2019re trying to convey here. When you say you\u2019re looking at all options and then you say also that the assets fit as a unit and would fit with other entities, I can't help but think, an outright sale could be possible and maybe if it were, sounds like there would be an all or nothing kind of thing. Is that an accurate interpretation of some of the messaging?","Steve Kean","All options are on the table.","Dennis Coleman","But if it were -- or I guess maybe just asking it in different way. Are you seeing incoming interest on the assets?","Steve Kean","Yes, all options are on the table. I think we\u2019re going to stick with that. Look, I think you can look around at that sector and there are some natural fits\u2026","Dennis Coleman","And there\u2019s some transactions there as well\u2026","Steve Kean","Yes, and there are some natural fits and this is a good set of assets. And there are people who are going to be attracted to it and there are people whose assets are going to be attractive to this. And that\u2019s why -- and we\u2019re going to get expertly advised for the KML Board on that.","Dennis Coleman","And then lastly, I guess I can't resist the credit rating question. It sounds like you\u2019re optimistic working towards an upgrade. And any comments you might make there on timing and conversations with the rating agencies?","Steve Kean","We have regular conversations with the agencies. We had some conversations in advance of this call, and we\u2019ll have some after the call. We think with what we\u2019re disclosing here, we should be poised for everything eligible for an upgrade but don\u2019t want to put anything ahead of the agency. So we\u2019ll be talking to them in the coming days.","Dennis Coleman","And then I do just have one last one. On the FERC, you've made some comments there that there\u2019s nothing on the July agenda. But after that then obviously we\u2019re about to lose a commissioner. Any thoughts on that in terms of your projects that that might need FERC review, or just -- also just on implementation of what they did in March?","Steve Kean","So first on the projects, don\u2019t see that as an issue, they\u2019ll still have a quorum. And one thing you\u2019ve really got to say about this commission is they -- once they got the quorum in place last year, they really started processing things and moving things along very effectively and caught up on their backlog and all of that. So I think that\u2019s all positive and we\u2019d expect that that would continue. On what it means for the tax number, we don\u2019t know. I think, there were as we said unintended consequences there and this is a big thing. And so we would hope that they would spend a little more time deliberating about this rather than rushing it through.","And I think that would be good for the overall success of what they\u2019re trying to do, but I think that would also be good for the companies under their jurisdiction. And it\u2019s not just us, a lot of companies urging them to do that and also urging them to fix some of the things that are in the NOPR as it is proposed right now. But we\u2019ll have a strategy for if it stays the way it is and we\u2019ll have a strategy for if it changes, or we\u2019ll work for it to change. But in either case, we expect its effect as we\u2019ve said all along to be mitigated and spread over time.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Catellier with CIBC. Your line is open.","Robert Catellier","I just had a couple of questions on KMI, and I think I\u2019d like the start with credit. I just want to understand what the pro forma company\u2019s credit profile will be. It looks like you have new $500 million credit facility but that might expire upon the sale of Trans Mountain. So if that\u2019s the case, what access to credit will you have pro forma?","David Michaels","We would put another one facility in place. As I said, the government [indiscernible] will go across -- clearly, we\u2019ll have working capital needs. And so we\u2019ll put in a facility in place after closing and obviously the press that are out [indiscernible] as well.","Robert Catellier","And then just going back to the question about what happens upon closing. How would you weigh keeping KML as a public company, now that its original intended purpose has changed, [or still not relevant] [ph] versus the advantages of simplifying the corporate structure?","Steve Kean","I mean, keeping KML as a public company is absolutely one of the options. I mean, it\u2019s smaller clearly, as you know, but it\u2019s certainly strong enough to stand on its own. And it\u2019s a good business and we\u2019ve got good operations. It\u2019s a business that we understand, and John and his team can get the most out of. We\u2019ve got a couple of expansion opportunities we\u2019re working on. I mean, this very -- that\u2019s very much an option for us. And so it is one of the options on the table.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Robert Kwan","So it's clear you want to upstream the cash that you're going to get on the sale up to KMI. And I\u2019m just wondering though if that happens, is it definitive from your side that the cash would also be paid out on restricted voters? Or do you see a potential scenario where KMI gets the cash but the cash is held say, for restrictive voters but not paid out?","Steve Kean","No, the way that structure works is both sets of shareholders are treated precisely the same, precisely the same.","Robert Kwan","Just turning to guidance, understandably, you\u2019re withdrawing it to sort all the time issues. But if you just drill down to the underlying assets, terminals, Cochin. Has anything changed in terms of tracking against the original guidance for those assets specifically?","Steve Kean","Robert, what I would say is there should be a meaningful change based on what we walk you through since the IPO with residual assets. But if you can appreciate, we're obviously divesting half of the Company the majority of employees, including a lot of the shared services that employees are going we've got a cost allocation methodology that\u2019s going. So we're happy to reconstitute the expense structure and everything. But again, we wouldn't expect that there is a meaningful change in the overall earnings power of the assets, first thing.","Robert Kwan","And just a last question related to that, there was a reference and you\u2019re withdrawing things like EBITDA and DCF guidance, but also the expected to clear dividends. Is that just because you're contemplating a potential special? Or maybe on the other side, if the residual assets become the going concern, is there potentially you decide to right-size the dividend just for what you got that\u2019s remaining?","Steve Kean","Yes, I think we will put that in the bucket and we'll decide what we\u2019re going to do and update guidance at the time once we made the decision.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Christine Cho","So I have some housekeeping questions. You guys talked earlier in Q&A about some slack capacity in Staten Island until there is a resolution. Can you just get into what the potential resolutions are?","Rich Kinder","There is a number of resolutions from [indiscernible] to leasing it out to specific customer to shutting it down and we're evaluating all of those. It has a very small earnings impact overall, but it does have a meaningful impact on utilization.","Christine Cho","And then what drove the one quarter delay in [indiscernible] and should we assume that all subsequent trains are delayed by the same timing?","Rich Kinder","First of all, there\u2019s some context here. So train one, once there\u2019s 10 trains total, train one, once it's in service attracts about 70% of the revenue. And so there is -- all I\u2019m saying Christine is there is a little bit -- it's a little bit less of an issue for the subsequent trains. But we still expect in Q3 of 2019 to be done with the entire project. The reason for the delay right now is multifactored. I mean, there was a delay in getting the units assembled and then delivered to the site. And we had some construction delays as well.","We've been active in our involvement with our EPC contractor who has also been active in trying to address those. And we think we have the issues identified and enhanced, but it works -- we definitely are experiencing one quarter delay. So we still expect to get this done. It's under budget. We\u2019ve got contingency remaining. It's still going to be a very economic project for us and our partners. But we have had this one quarter delay.","Christine Cho","And then can you remind us, for the unhedged portion of your crude production and CO2. Is that fully exposed to the Midland basin?","Kimberly Dang","No, in 2018, we have 87% of the Mid-Cush spread hedged.","Christine Cho","And then the 13% is not?","Kimberly Dang","And then the 13% of Mid-Cush is not, right.","Christine Cho","And then last question, in the event that you -- it sounds like you guys are in okay shape for Gulf Coast Express. But in the event that you don\u2019t get a waiver for this deal for the Permian Highway Pipeline. Should we think that the pipeline eats the cost, or is the tariff going to be adjusted? How should we think about that?","Steve Kean","Yes, first of all, it's not necessarily seeking a waiver in order to do it. It's really more for making a decision about where we\u2019re going to get the pipe and making sure we\u2019ve got a clear path to get it, not relying on a state department waiver of our ability to get the pipe or get this deal for that. We are working on making sure that our cost estimate is adequate and to make sure that we\u2019re fully protected. It is a competitive market though and so there is some limit on the ability to try to negotiate a pass through arrangement with shippers.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Tom Abrams","I just wanted to suggest that if you do close down Staten Island, I think that place could use a really massive water park.","Steve Kean","We\u2019ll take that into consideration\u2026","Rich Kinder","Yes, duly noted\u2026","Tom Abrams","But I wanted to ask though if you -- on IMO 2020, if you got any preliminary thoughts on how your vessels might respond to that?","Steve Kean","Our vessels don\u2019t burn that type of fuel oil, it's all [indiscernible] and there is no impact on our business there.","Operator","The next question comes from Douglas Christopher with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Douglas Christopher","When we look at KMI and we see its recovery as a leader in the midstream and volumes in the profits. And you talked about your great attribute to the company being strategically positioned fee-based assets predictable cash flows. It seems like the CO2 business, you live with downside and we don't realize the upside. Can you just add a little more color, help us understand why it makes sense to remain involved in that business? Thanks.","Steve Kean","Part of that business is -- so let's start with our overall segment earnings before DD&A. CO2 makes up on a budgeted basis for 2018 about 11% of that. Of that 11 that split 4 and 7 between source of transportation, which looks a little bit more like a midstream business, that\u2019s why we\u2019re moving the CO2 into the market for our use but also for the use of third-party customers who are involved in enhanced oil recovery, that leaves 7% to COR. And as I said earlier, there is very economically recoverable oil out there at today's prices and even prices that are much lower than today's prices, the only way you can get that out is with CO2. We've got the CO2.","And then we\u2019ve got the field and we\u2019ve got the EOR expertise. So it's an opportunity that we integrated forward into, if you will. We started with the pipeline and then we added and enhanced oil recovery field. We get good returns in the business. It\u2019s a business that we understand. We hedge in order to make those cash flows more predictable for our investors. So it has more of a stable and predictable cash flow. Our production is very predictable there. We come within 1%, 1.5% of what we budget every year.","And as I said earlier, notwithstanding all those good attributes, we are a shareholder driven company. And if we found the right opportunity somebody was willing to pay us a sufficient amount and it was in the best interest of our shareholders, we'd obviously evaluate that. But for now, we're happy to hold it as well.","Operator","We're showing no further questions at this time.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Well, Sheila, thank you very much and thanks to everybody for listening to a rather lengthy call. We appreciate your attention.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Jay and welcome to our quarterly call. Before we begin, as always, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1935 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements, and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","Before turning to Steve Kean, our CEO and Kim Dang, our CFO for an update on our operational and financial performance, let me just start the call by reiterating our strategy at Kinder Morgan. We\u2019re all about creating value for our shareholders. To accomplish that goal, we\u2019ve worked really diligently in 2016 to strengthen our balance sheet, and we did. We also achieved financial performance consistent with the guidance we\u2019ve been giving since our first quarter call in April 2016. We expect that the strengthening of the balance sheet will continue in 2017.","We also expect that when we finish our work on JVs and as we work through the backlog, we will be producing cash well in excess of our investment needs. While we have alternatives in using that cash to deliver value to shareholders, our current thinking remains that the best way to deliver that value is through substantially increasing our dividend. We expect to update you on that in the later part of this year when we announce our dividend policy for 2018. Steve?","Steve Kean","Yes. Ken, will take you through the fourth quarter and full year performance in detail. So I am going to focus on three themes on our performance that have implications for 2017 and beyond; first, our balance sheet strengthening initiative; second, progress on our growth projects; and third, where we are beginning to see some positive indications in the sector.","On the first, we ended the year ahead of target at 5.3 times debt to EBITDA after executing on a number of joint ventures and divestitures through the year. We've built our plans for 2017 to continue that progress, including a joint venture, or IPO, of the Trans Mountain expansion. Both of those approaches are attractive to us and interest is strong. We will develop both alternatives further this quarter and position ourselves to take advantage of the best one in terms of value and other key terms.","We believe that syndicating Trans Mountain is the right answer for our shareholders and for the project. It now represents close to half of our backlog. And we believe the value we can receive from investors willing to participate plus the syndication of risk that comes with it, makes bringing in other investors to best approach. We've counted nothing to the value we believe will be realized from investors who wish to participate in the project when we came up with our ending debt metric of 5.4 times for 2017. So, we believe we've left ourselves some room to improve on that metric as the year goes on. Bottom line, we exceeded what we said we would in 2016, and we will work to beat our 2017 target as well.","Second, with respect to progress on our projects, starting with the backlog, it now stands at $12 billion, which is down from $13 billion last quarter. We placed little under $800 million with the projects into service during the quarter and about $1.8 billion over the full year 2016. We removed $200 million for the projects in the quarter, and overall $4.6 billion of projects were removed over the full year. Some of the removals during the year were based on regulatory circumstances, but in almost all cases, we were eliminating the project in order to accelerate progress -- removing the project, accelerated progress on the balance sheet and freed up capital for higher return projects.","We also had $50 million of reduced cost in the quarter, again still reconciling the backlog here. We added $167 million of new investments during the quarter, and $740 million for the full year. Now, much of that and some of the project removals were a function of high-grading our investments within CO2, eliminating some projects adding others.","In short, we high-graded the backlog to strengthen the balance sheet and directing our capital to the highest return opportunity, just as we said we would. So, in 2016; we improved the balance sheet; made progress on our projects; found a few new high return projects; closed the year with DCF and EBITDA results in line with what we've been projecting since April; covered our dividend and our growth CapEx needs without needing to access capital markets; and we expect to continue our progress in 2017.","I think also worth noting, we've been watching counter-party credit risk over the course of the year. And we've not had a default resulting in a revenue impact to us since early April of this year. We made that a priority, and I think we've been successful through the year. Of course, we were impacted early in the first quarter by bankruptcies from some of our coal customers. But we've done a very good job of holding the line since then on counter-party credit.","So, third, I'll give you an overview of the road ahead and some market recovery begins to take shape in the markets we serve. Starting with natural gas; North American Gas continues to be the long-term fuel-of-choice in meeting domestic and increasingly international energy needs; growth, we believe, is going to be driven by the emerging demand coal from power plants; gas, exceeded coal\u2019s share of power demand for the first time in 2016. Second, exports to Mexico, of which KM has about 75% share. LNG exports, which of course are emerging on the Gulf Coast and expect to reach a full level of between 8 Bcf and 9 Bcf of capacity limit build-out is complete of just the current projects, and finally Gulf Coast, petchem and industrial demand.","So in green shoots, we saw some green shoots in the fourth quarter, including some record setting days on two of our larger systems. The return of price volatility, which our storage business is, we\u2019re able to take advantage of both for 2016 period, as well as for 2017. We had about a half of Bcf of new natural gas capacity sign ups, so less than 100 of that was -- about 60 of that was existing capacity, bringing the total over the last three year period up to 8.7 Bcf.","While gathered volumes were down on our system, the return of rigs to the Eagle Ford and Haynesville, the resilience of our assets in the Bakken where we actually kept oil gathered at roughly flat, and increase our gas gathering volumes, were good leading indicators for us. To put this in context, our gas business represents about 55% of our segment earnings and gathering and processing is about 20% of that number.","In North American crude, green shoots were apparent as rig count rose significantly over the last half year, and U.S. production actually grew during the fourth quarter. Producers have continued to lower their breakeven prices with respect to the Eagle Ford's specifically, which is hit especially hard, was hit especially hard by the downturn. Acreage has now started to change hand from capital constrained players to new owners who we expect we will do more with that position. We expect to see volumes in the Eagle Ford, both gas and oil, to continue to decline in the first part of 2017 before flattening and then starting to grow as 2017 progresses.","Refined products have held steady. Pipelines are the cost effective way to move products from refining to market centers, and we have the largest refined product pipelines position. Further, our terminals assets are well positioned. About 80% of segment earnings before DD&A and the terminal sector and outcomes from liquids and that is predominantly from refined products. And in Huston, in particular, we are in a great position to participate and demand growth, as well as export growth through refined products.","On NGLs, while the NGL processing business is a small part of our network, there is visible growth that we are positioned to benefit from, as petchem projects are completed over next one to two years. So, overall, the long-term prospects for North American Energy are bright, and our efforts are well positioned to participate in the recovery and growth.","I am going to conclude with an update on two largest projects, Trans Mountain and Elba. First, on Trans Mountain, Trans Mountain achieved two critical milestones in December of 16, and this month in '17. On December 2nd, we received a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity from the government of Canada. And just last week, British Columbia Premier Clark announced that we have met our five conditions that she specified for heavy oil pipelines crossing B.C., and also importantly, the B.C. government issued its environmental order approving the project with conditions.","These were enormous steps forward in enabling us to help Canadian producers, access world markets, and the steps were taken in connection with an overall package of federal and provincial policies and decisions designed to mitigate and address environmental, climate, and First Nation's concerns. The comprehensive set of announcements coming from the federal and provincial governments over the last several months. Of which, this project was just one piece. This expansion, our expansion, is needed as Canadian oil sands production continues to grow, even though it's at a slower pace than it was two years ago, and pipeline take-away capacity is constrained.","We remain confident that the vast majority of our shippers want the capacity that they have, some may even want more. And there are other customers who are interested in capacity, if it were to become available. So, this project has advanced significantly since our update last quarter. Here is what remains for us; we\u2019re finalizing our cost estimate for the shippers; we expect now that's going to be delivered in early February; we then have the shipper review of those costs, that takes place over a 30-day period; and then we have a final investment decision that we expect to make sometime late Q1 or early Q2. During this period, we\u2019ll be working on bringing in additional investors, either in the context of the joint venture or as an IPO, as I mentioned. So, it's going to be a busy next few months on our largest projects.","Turning to Elba, we\u2019re under construction here. We are receiving notices to proceed from FERC under the 7(c) that we got, the certificate that we got last June. The notices are coming through on a timely basis. So we\u2019re under construction. Just a reminder, we have a 20-year contract with Shell in this project. While not essential in our contracts with Shell, the project now has both FTA and non-FTA that is Free Trade Agreement export authorization.","We've got an EPC contract in place. We have this project identified as a JV candidate, and believe that the prospects for concluding something on that front are very good. As we've said before, we don\u2019t have to JV the project, but we believe it's a good candidate, will attract good value from investors. And we believe the prospects of concluding something there are very good.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer and our newest Board member, Kim Dang.","Kim Dang","Thanks, Steve. Today, we\u2019re declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share, consistent with our budget. I'm going to take you through all the numbers as usual. But I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find any surprises in our results. As adjusted EBITDA, GCF and net debt to adjusted EBITDA are all consistent with the guidance that we have provided since April updated for the SNG transaction.","Starting with the preliminary GAAP income statement, you will see that revenues are down and costs of sales have increased, resulting in about $457 million reduction in gross margins. As I've told you many quarters, we do not believe that changes in revenue, or revenue itself, are a good predictor of our performance. However, when revenues are down, we generally see a reduction in our cost of sales, which more than offset the reduction in revenues as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. That did not hold true this quarter, so let me explain.","Both revenues and cost of sales are impacted by non-cash, non-recurring accounting entries, which we call certain items. Certain items contributed $237 million of the quarter-over-quarter gross margin reduction with the largest being an approximately $200 million of revenue that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to a pipeline contract buyout.","Adjusting for these certain items, gross margin would have been down $220 million. The largest contributor to this decrease is the sale of 50% interest in SNG. As a result of the sale, we no longer consolidate SNGs revenues or cost of sales. But it's fair to report our 50% interest in net income further down the income statement as equity earnings. Keep in mind also that SNG did not have significant cost of sales. The impact of deconsolidated SNG was approximately $134 million reduction in gross margin for the quarter, leaving a reduction in gross margin of about $86 million, which I think is more consistent with how we would view our results.","The main drivers of the remaining gross margin reduction are consistent with those that I'll cover for you on DCF in a moment. Net income available for common shareholders in the quarter was $170 million or $0.08 per share versus a loss of $721 million or a loss per share of $0.32 in the fourth quarter of the prior year, resulting in an increase of $891 million or $0.40 a share.","Now, before everyone celebrates a 125% increase in our earnings, let me give you the numbers adjusted for certain items. Net income available to common shareholders before certain items was $410 million versus the adjusted number in 2015 of $463 million, down $53 million or 11%. EPS before certain items was $0.18, down $0.03 versus the fourth quarter of 2016.","Certain items in the fourth quarter of this year were in expense of $239 million. The largest of which was $250 million non-cash impairment of our investment in Ruby. Although, the majority of Ruby's capacity is contracted until 2021, the impairment was driven by delay and expected West Coast natural gas demand to be on that timeframe. Certain items in 2015 were a net expense of $1.2 billion, also driven primarily by non-cash impairments.","Let's turn to the second page of financials now, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers in the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our 2016 performance is consistent with the guidance provided since April, updated for the SNG transaction. DCF and adjusted EBITDA are approximately 4% below our budget, and net debt to adjusted EBITDA is 5.3 times.","We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.147 billion versus $1.233 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $86 million or 7%. There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation, the segments are down $123 million, primarily due to reduction in our natural gas and CO2 segment as a result to the 50% SNG sale and lower realized oil prices.","Interest expense was reduced by $41 million versus the fourth quarter in the prior year, as we use the proceeds from the SNG transaction to repay debt. These two items the change in the segment and the change in interest expense, net to a change of $82 million or approximately 95% of the DCF change. DCF per share of $0.51 versus $0.55 for the fourth quarter of the prior year, are down $0.04. Almost all of which is associated with the DCF earnings I just walked you through. $0.51 in DCF per share results in $867 million of excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter. For the full year, DCF per share was $2.2, resulting in almost $3.4 billion excess distributable cash flow above our dividend.","Now, let me give you a little more detail on the segment performance. The natural gas segment is down $114 million, largely due to the sale of SNG. Increased contribution from TGP expansion projects placed in service largely offsets lower midstream volumes. CO2 decreased by approximately $54 million due to lower oil price and approximately 8% lower production. As Steve mentioned, the lower production was partially driven by project deferrals, as well as reallocating capital higher return projects with slower production response.","The Terminals segment was up $39 million or 15%, driven by increased contributions from our Jones Act tankers and our joint venture with BP. Products was up 19%, impacted by higher volumes on KMCC and Double H pipes, and favorable performance in our Transmix business. And KMC was down about $5 million due to timing above it. Versus our budget, as I previously mentioned, adjusted EBITDA was about 4% below budget, largely as a result of the partial sale of SNG, lower gas midstream and natural gas volumes in our natural gas segment, full bankruptcy impact, and reduced liquid throughput and ancillaries in our Terminal segment, lower crude and condensate volumes in our products and lower crude and condensate volumes in our product segment.","The individual segments ended up very consistent with the guidance we gave you in the prior quarter. DCF was down approximately 4% with the negative variance on adjusted EBITDA, somewhat offset by reduced interest and sustaining CapEx. With that, I\u2019ll move to the balance sheet.","On the balance sheet, you will see total assets down about $3.8 billion. A huge driver of the reduction in assets was the scale of SNG, and you can see that coming through primarily in the plant, property and equipment line and the reduction in goodwill. Net debt, we ended the quarter at $38.16 billion. That translates into net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 5.3 times, as I\u2019ve previously mentioned, consistent with the guidance we gave you.","For the year, debt is decreased $3.064 billion and for the quarter we had a reduction in debt of $1.088 billion. And so let me reconcile that for you. In the quarter, $1.088 billion reduction in debt, we had $1.147 billion of DCF. We had about $627 million in expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments. We had divestiture proceeds of $77 million plus $776 million of the SNG divestiture proceeds. We had placed in Escrow on September 30th to pay down debt on October 1. So those proceeds were released from Escrow. And then we paid dividend of $279 million. Working capital and other items were very small source of cash.","For the year, reduction in debt of $3.064 billion, DCF was $4.511 billion, expansion CapEx acquisitions and contributions to equity investments were a use of cash of $3.06 billion. Now, that number is a little bit different from the number you saw in the press release and that\u2019s because this is a cash number and the number in the press release is an accrual number. We\u2019ve got divestiture proceeds of $2.94 billion, and the biggest piece of that was SNG. SNG, we got $1.4 billion in cash and then also $1.2 billion, and that was deconsolidated. The other contributors to divestitures proceeds, we sold our Parkway pipeline. We got a $142 million. We got a promote on Utopia, and then we've got some proceeds on some small terminal sales.","Dividends for the year $1.12 billion, and then working capital on other items was a use cash of about $210 million. And that's a whole laundry list of things, including the Maple payments that we paid on the debt that we repaid in conjunction with the SNG transaction, timing on distributions from JVs, margin that went out the door, working capital used on AP and AR, offset by positive working capital on property tax. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay, thank you. And Jay, we're willing to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Participants, we will start the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Kristina Kazarian","So, congrats on the TMX milestones, I got a quick question here though. So I know, I'm still waiting for FID, and you guys were thinking about what the final cost number will be. But could you just talk a little bit about that in the context of the 6.7 times spill-over with multiple you referred to when talking about the project backlog. And just generally, how I should be thinking about the return on this project?","Steve Kean","The return on -- it\u2019s a very good return on the project. It is if you think about our overall backlog multiple being about 6.5 times EBITDA, it's a little bit better than that. Now, keep in mind, there's capital spend that's going on for a while under this project, so that doesn't translate directly into an IRR. But it\u2019s a very attractive returning project. And what we invest in this project, wherever that number comes about, we earn on that number when we set the final cost.","Kristina Kazarian","And then could you give a quick update on Utopia, as well? I know the press release reference progress made on the right of way. But how should I be thinking about that?","Steve Kean","So actually this call last quarter we had just gotten an order from one of the courts in Ohio, finding that Utopia did not have imminent domain in that particular jurisdiction. We\u2019ve since had mixed results, meaning that some have found eminent domain rights, common career status, and public utility status in the eminent domain. But we can't wait for all of that to resolve itself so we Ron McClain and his team put together a strategy to go pursue the right of way, notwithstanding whatever the courts decide. And they've made very good progress on that. And so I think the way to think about it is we believe we're going to get it done, and we've acquired a substantial amount of the right of way, and we believe we're going to complete it.","Kristina Kazarian","And last one from me. Can you guys talk a little bit more about this, small but looks like new JV with EnLink? And what the genesis for this project and strategic venture is?","Steve Kean","Yes, so we have a position in the scoop\/stack area that came as part of the Hiland acquisition, and some acreage dedications there, commitments there. And we looked for the most, the best, returning opportunity to get that system built-out. And essentially because there's additional processing capacity in the area, we were able to come up with a much better project from an NPB standpoint, and if we had later on pipe and built the brand new processing facility. So it turns out better for shareholder. We utilize some under-utilized capacity that our partner had, and end up with the better results for our customer and shareholders.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Just had a couple of quick questions. I guess, just following up on the TMX question. With the focus towards the -- to a potential JV, I was wondering if you can talk to us about how we should think about expectations of what the promote could potentially look like? If I recall with Utopia did about 20% promote. But at the same time, when I look at where Canadian pipelines are trading at these days, it seems to be far higher than that. Is there a scenario where we could see a promote that\u2019s -- it will in excess of 20%. I was wondering if you can give us some color as to how to think how it would work?","Steve Kean","Well, no. We specifically have not given specific guidance on that, because frankly we don\u2019t want to set a marker out there. We want to run a process and test that value. But we don\u2019t want potential counter parties to see a number out there that they feel like if I hit that then I\u2019m done. And so, we think it\u2019s best for our shareholders, best for the project overall, if we just run the process.","Rick Kinder","But we can say that the interest has been very strong from potential JV partners, and also strong interest in an IPO as an alternative.","Shneur Gershuni","And as a follow-up question, in your prepared remarks, Steve, you talked about green shoots. What I think about the contracted nature of many of your assets in terms of some MBCs and fee base and so forth. I was wondering if you can talk about if these green shoots to do continue, where we can potentially see a positive revision to your EBITDA guidance for 2017?","Steve Kean","What might affect our guidance, actually we\u2019ll get into that in a fair amount of detail next week at the call. I think one place that we\u2019ve seen some value that actually have had an impact, and now we\u2019ve got, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s going to exceed 2017 plan. But the return of some value to the storage assets, I think, has been a good sign. And that\u2019s a place, that\u2019s a potential positive. But we\u2019re getting to some -- and you could say that too about throughput on our products pipeline potentially, throughput on -- through our terminals facilities, et cetera. But we\u2019ll give you a pretty good look next week on what we think the drivers are in our business for 2017.","Shneur Gershuni","And the final follow up and I suspect this is the next week answer as well too. But you put out the return marker of 6.7 times, excluding CO2 projects. I was wondering if you can remind us what the target was for CO2 related projects, and how much of the backlog is represented by CO2 these days.","Steve Kean","Yes, so we have set a minimum of 15% unlevered after-tax for CO2. And the projects that we\u2019ve approved recently were well in excess of that amount. So, we\u2019re now trying to identify -- we\u2019re trying to identify good high returning projects, stress test for different oil price scenarios et cetera. But we set that as kind of a minimum. And the total on EOR -- the total on CO2 is $1.4 billion of the $12 billion in the backlog.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is open go ahead please.","Brandon Blossman","Let's try a couple of LNG related questions. Thinking about the potential for an Elba JV, what are the metrics that will help you determine whether or not it makes sense to you? Is it a return threshold? Is it a de-levering -- deleveraging metric, EBITDA or something else, or a combination of all the above?","Steve Kean","Well, the reason for considering a JV on Elba is to address the balance sheet. So we of course take into account what the impact is going to be on our leverage metric. But it's really a function of return. Now, it's the value that we get for someone buying-in and participating in the project.","Brandon Blossman","The Southwest Louisiana supply project, is that tied to the Cameron online date, or is that contractual February 18th?","Rich Kinder","No, it is tied to the first in service on that project.","Brandon Blossman","But it looks like there's the potential you get your part done before them, I guess. And then just very simplistically, on CO2 projects north of 15% return, and I assume that that's for crude pricing, correct?","Steve Kean","Yes, we look at it on a strip, but then we also look at it with the sensitivity off of that strip to make sure that to look at what a NPV '15 breakeven price would need to be. So, we look at the pricing in a couple of different ways.","Brandon Blossman","Okay, that\u2019s all. Thanks\u2026","Steve Kean","There's always the potential if there's downside risk in the pricing where we still have a nice return in economic project works.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is open, go ahead please.","Jean Ann Salisbury","It's been an enabler that Trump is supportive of Keystone. I'm just wondering what impact, if any, that has on the potential of Trans Mountain shippers, and maybe they're willing just to pay?","Steve Kean","So, we don't think that it has much impact. We think that there're some significant advances to the Trans Mountain project. Of course it is under contract with shippers. And it is these projects that we believe is in the lead, and gets people to tide-water where they can access a world market price. And so there's a strong interest in it, and that strong interest has continued after Trump's election and after his comments on Keystone.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And also on Trans Mountain, the Canadian dollar has fallen pretty significantly since you've started the Trans Mountain process. I think that\u2019s also true. But I just want to make sure that both the CapEx and the tariffs are in Canadian dollars, so there\u2019s not really any ForEx impact either way?","Steve Kean","So, we\u2019ve carried the CapEx in our backlog in U.S. dollars. But yes, the tariff is in Canadian dollars, and the CapEx that gets communicated to our customers will be in Canadian dollars as well.","Jean Ann Salisbury","So just in terms of return, there is not really ForEx exposure?","Steve Kean","No.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, thank you. And then\u2026","Kim Dang","Most of the spend is in Canadian dollars.","Steve Kean","Right.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, thank you. And then last one is, you noted that figures in the gas volumes were down because of Texas intrastate due to declining Eagle Ford. I am just wondering how much room there is for Permian gas growth to offset this or if you\u2019re kind of near your max for Permian gas lift? [Ph]","Rich Kinder","On the Intrastate?","Jean Ann Salisbury","Yes.","Rich Kinder","Yes. We are fairly full of intrastate rate system of what we can see from the Permian. As Steve said earlier, I think we are approaching a bottom in the Eagle Ford volumes to expect those to flatten out towards the middle of the year and more the likely with oil later in 2017.","Steve Kean","And Permian volume, I mean the intrastate aside for a moment, Permian volume growth does tend to drive good value on our EPNG assets.","Rich Kinder","Right.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Darren Horowitz","Couple of quick questions. The first, within Products Pipes, on that segment, exiting 4Q and I realize, we will get more detail on this next Wednesday, but exiting 4Q, were you guys more optimistic about the incremental uplift on NGL volumes and margins or possibly what KMCC and Double H could do as capacity utilization improves into the first quarter?","Steve Kean","Ron, do you want to\u2026","Ron McClain","Well, what we are seeing recently is strong volumes in Q4 and in January and we expect that to fall off a little bit, but I think we expect KMCC volumes to return as Tom said, rest of the year, and should drill [indiscernible]","Darren Horowitz","I am just trying to get a sense of the expected pull through and kind of how that segment ultimately shakes up for year-over-year performance thinking about the quarters, but I know we are getting to that on Wednesday, so we can defer till then. If I could just switch quickly over to CO2, within that 8% lower reported production estimate or actual, outside of those project deferrals and that reallocation of capital, the projects, production response that you guys discussed, was there anything from a legacy organic field decline perspective that caught your attention, maybe pattern conformance or anything that we should be looking out for?","Steve Kean","I think, look, there is a natural decline associated with those fields and we continue to work for ways to offset those declines, and historically we have been able to do that. And we are looking at and we will go over this next week as well looking for some opportunities to flatten out again or potentially even grow that production with some new opportunities in those fields. I guess, I wouldn\u2019t say that there was anything unexpected in what we saw in our results there.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. And then, last question from me. Kim, just a quick housekeeping one on that $215 million impairment on the equity investment in Ruby, recognizing obviously the non-cash nature of it, can you quantify for us maybe the magnitude and timing shift of that West Coast natural gas demand that drove the impairment to be recognized? I am just trying to get a sense of the drivers behind it.","Kim Dang","Sure. It probably moved out three to four years.","Darren Horowitz","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Keith Stanley - Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Keith Stanley","How are you guys thinking about some of the legal challenges to the Trans Mountain project, just your thoughts there on where you expect to be challenged, how you are feeling about the legal case and over what timeline we should expect some of these challenges to play out?","Steve Kean","Okay. Yes, several parts to that answer. So, one is legal challenges have already been filed. Most of the legal challenges to date related to the project have resulted positively for the project continuing. And a big part of that I think is due to the fact that the Canadian government provincially and federally has taken a long time, a lot of care, and gathered a lot of information, and attached to lot of conditions and engaged in lot of consultation in order to make the orders that they ultimately issued very strong and hard to overturn on appeal. So, it was a lot of good work, building the record and listening to, responding to, and putting in place the appropriate conditions to deal with the legitimate concerns that have been raised.","Our view of the appeals and we\u2019ll be filling our responses today or shortly to those that have already been filled is that they are unlikely to succeed on the merits on appeal and that given the much higher standard for something like in injunction for example, they are unlike to succeed in getting something that actually stops the project. So, I think the credit goes to our team up there, but certainly the government engaging in such a thorough process which ultimately makes those orders very strong.","Keith Stanley","Great. So, you sound pretty confident there. One follow-up, just any more color on the merits when you are considering a JV partner for the project relative to an IPO of the Canadian business, just how you are weighing what some of the positives and negatives would be of each option? And then also how do we think about the timing of when you would look to do a sell down, is it soon after FID or would you wait a little while on this?","Rich Kinder","Let's start with the timing. We would anticipate doing something [indiscernible] with the FID or shortly thereafter. And as far as timing is concerned, I think that that will give you an idea. There is a lot of pros and cons between the JVs and IPO, and we can get into more detail perhaps next week on that. But I think the real salient point is that both are very good potential alternatives. And we think we're going to have the ability to make a selection between the good and the better. So, we think that it's going to be a decision that benefits our shareholders for the long run.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Craig Shere","Quick question, once you are done with the balance sheet repair, are you still planning on financing half of ongoing growth CapEx that is separate from JV partners in the debt markets and the rest sub operating cash flow?","Rich Kinder","I think that's a good summary. Obviously, we\u2019ll look into circumstance as we go forward. But, predilection would be to get to the point where we have gotten our balance sheet in the right shape, and we think we are getting a lot closer to that. That's what we've indicated. I think you\u2019ll see good results from JVs over the course of this year that will move us in that direction. And when we\u2019ve done that and as -- we will be able to maintain that balance sheet that debt to EBITDA ratio and without putting out new equity, unless we desire to do so. So, we will be using excess coverage dollars above our dividend payouts to fund the equity portion of the capital expenditures. And while we look at all the alternatives, as far as good new projects on a going forward basis, obviously Trans Mountain project is a little bit like that over you saw about the pig going through the restricted. [Ph] It is a huge pig going through and when you get through on the other side, we anticipate our capital expenditure levels will be less. We are still going to be looking for growth opportunities but our capital expenditures will not be as great.","Craig Shere","On that node, it didn\u2019t sound like there was maybe much added in terms of new project origination in the fourth quarter. How comfortable are you given the positive signs already discussed that maybe would just start to move over the next couple of years back towards that 2 billion to 3 billion and annual project origination?","Steve Kean","Yes and that could happen. I mean, like we\u2019ve always said, we will continue to look for good, higher returning projects. We believe that is the best way to deliver values who invested in good, high returning projects. But I think our current view is that we are likely to generate cash as these projects come on. We are likely to generate cash in excess of those -- equity portion of those investment opportunities. And in those circumstances, we believe the best way to return value to shareholders is within increasing dividend.","Craig Shere","Understood, yes. If you are only having to cover half of that, your operating cash, so you definitely have a lot free.","Steve Kean","That\u2019s right.","Craig Shere","So, last question, any update, I suppose that you might touch on some specifics on the segments next week but any update about prospects for contracting remaining unhedged Jones Act tankers?","Steve Kean","Yes. Currently, I believe everything that\u2019s on the water is under charter.","Unidentified Company Representative","11 of the 16 are under long-term contracts. That have some exposure, the total exposure for next year to our budget is $2.9 million or 0.2% of our total budget for 2017.","Steve Kean","0.29% for the total budget.","Craig Shere","I got you. So, all the exposure is for what's -- in terms of anything meaningful, what\u2019s yet to be delivered?","Steve Kean","Well, in sum, our existing charter terminations as well as ships roll off of charter. And look, I think we\u2019ve been very active in re-chartering vessels as charter expirations come up, and I think have been pretty successful in what is no doubt a down market and making sure that our ships have charters even if it\u2019s at a reduced rate. And that will continue to be our goal through the year. I think also, we would hope that we and the other large vessel companies would be able to take a little business from the ATB market and I think we are beginning to see; we are competing for that business as well. We\u2019re starting to see that.","Operator","Alright our next question is coming from the line of Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Danilo Juvane","I wanted to circle back the question on Ruby. So, there was a write down on Ruby this quarter. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, MEP was written down last quarter. Are there any expectations of additional write downs on a going forward basis perhaps? ","Kim Dang","I think carrying value on Fayetteville is like a $100 million. So, it\u2019s got a relatively low carrying value. We have to asses our assets every quarter and to make sure that we\u2019re carrying them at the right value. I don\u2019t see significant risk of imperilments going forward but we will have to make that assessment based on market conditions at the end of every quarter.","Danilo Juvane","Got it. And the last question for me, most of my questions have been asked. What was the CO2 CapEx spend this past quarter?","Steve Kean","I don\u2019t think we have a quarterly number for you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Go ahead, please. ","Jeremy Tonet","Just want to go back to TMX here and just want to clarify, do you see any situation where you would go to loan with this project or at this point you feel you have a lot of certainty with regards to the JV or IPO options, if you\u2019re pretty certain that that would happen at this point?","Steve Kean","It\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s the latter. I mean, that\u2019s an option to us but I\u2019d say, as I said at the very beginning, we think that syndicating this is the right answer overall. And we think that the interest level is high enough and strong enough for whichever route that we take that we\u2019re going to be successful in that syndication.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thanks. And then, could you just walk us through what you think might be the optimal amount to monetize at this point and how you kind of think about gives and takes there?","Steve Kean","It varies so much depending on the structure that\u2019s pursued and it\u2019s a broad enough range that I can\u2019t really give you a specific answer there.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay, great. And then just a housekeeping one there, what was the last number for the CapEx spend there; how current is that?","Steve Kean","We have been carrying -- so it is as we said in the earlier discussion, we\u2019ve been carrying it at 5.4. And if you did -- U.S., so when you see it in our backlog, it\u2019s sitting there at U.S.$5.4 and if you converted that at the current exchange rate, it\u2019s about U.S.$6.","Jeremy Tonet","And when was that last updated?","Steve Kean","We\u2019ve carried that same number for a while and what\u2019s happened is just by kind of happenstances the FX rates have changed; it stayed reasonably closely in line, so we haven\u2019t updated U.S. dollar number since the beginning of the project for our U.S. investors. But it was done at a time when the loonie and the dollar were at par.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay, not material cost or anything that\u2019s changed much. And then just one last and as far as shipper contracts, is everything set there, is there any deadlines where things go past certain time frames that that could be changed or anything like that?","Steve Kean","No, to be clear on the earlier question, costs have changed, costs have changed and what we\u2019re in the process of doing now, an increased and is communicating that final cost estimate to shippers which we expect to have prepared and delivered to them in early February. That\u2019s the current thinking. And then, there is a 30-day period of shipper review where they examine the underlying cost because once that cost is set, that is the investment; that is what we earn on. So, there'll be a review process over the 30 subsequent days after we give them the final cost estimate.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, and all the shippers are fully committed; are there any kind of drop dead dates where contracts should reopen or anything like that?","Steve Kean","If the costs exceed a certain level, then there is an opportunity for customers to reconsider their position and turn their capacity back. But as I said at the beginning, there's enough interest from current shippers potentially in expanding their position as well as from other potential customers who are not currently shippers, wanting to come in that we remain very confident that capacity gets placed at the level it is today.","Jeremy Tonet","That makes a lot of sense, I would expect there to be very high demand. And then, just one last one if I could, as far as -- it seems like we're starting to see the makings of some industry consolidation out there, kind of small players can pull there in GP LP consolidation, continuing to pick up pace after you guys. I'm just wondering how you see Kinder Morgan playing in that -- within that context going forward and whether that could be an opportunity to expedite delevering if you could do an all equity deal there?","Steve Kean","We continue to look in that market, continue to look for those opportunities. We do, and implied in your question, we're looking at DCF accretion but we are also looking at leverage improvement as well. That narrows the feel frankly, that narrows the feel, but we continue to look actively in that market for opportunities.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir. Go ahead.","Rich Kinder","John, how are you doing?","John Edwards","Doing good, Rich, and congrats on the approvals on Trans Mountain.","Rich Kinder","Thank you. We think they're very significant.","John Edwards","Just a couple of clarifications, can you share with us or remind us how much has been spent on Trans Mountain development to-date? And then in terms of the cost overruns or if there's cost overruns, it sounds like the way things are structured with the shippers that they would in terms of what they would pay on the shipping cost, they in fact bear a portion or all or maybe if you can share if there's cost overruns how that works?","Steve Kean","So, starting with the first question, it's roughly CAD$600 million gross and so there's also, remember, we have part of our development costs are covered; it's over a 10-year period but they're covered under our what we call our firm 50 dock charges. So, years ago, we signed up shippers to give them access to firms based across our existing Westridge dock and those proceeds go toward the deferring of development costs and over the life of that, those charges is about 250, CAD$255 million. So, you have to net that off and those don't all come in the same time that we're doing development. As I said some of it can come over time but it's CAD$600 million gross. And then that\u2019s a firm 50 off of that.","On how the cost structure works, once the final cost estimate is delivered and we proceed toward project execution, there are two categories of costs. There's a set of uncapped costs, and those are costs where if there is an overrun, then that overrun would be to the projects accounts. Then there is a set of uncapped costs. And those overruns, if there are any, those overruns would be added to the investments in the project, and we would earn on those. So, it\u2019s not just flow through, it becomes part of the investment and we earn on it. And those tend to be, as you\u2019d expect, the most predictable elements of the build. They apply to things like steel costs, which are not going to be an issue, aboriginal consultation, ultimate accommodation -- consultation and accommodation costs and two particular parts of the build that are likely to be difficult and unpredictable when we\u2019re forecasting it.","Having said all that, what we\u2019re delivering to shippers will be P95. So, we feel like with all the work that\u2019s been done, we have narrowed the estimates, both on capped and uncapped costs to a very, very narrow level. And at a 95% probability, meaning a 95% probability that would come in at or under the number that we deliver. So, we think we\u2019ve done a lot of work to make sure we have our arms around what the cost risks are there, and are taking them into account in the final cost estimates.","John Edwards","Okay. And just to help about what percentage is capped and what percent is uncapped?","Steve Kean","I don\u2019t have that off hand; the majority is going to be capped. But I don\u2019t have the specific percentage of the uncapped portion. But the majority -- the substantial majority of the costs will be in the capped category.","John Edwards","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. So, it sounds like there is some kind of a sharing on the uncapped and then the capped, that\u2019s basically predictable costs that are locked in. So that\u2019s the idea, correct?","Steve Kean","Well, yes, and on the uncapped, to be clear on that too, there is a possibility since these are the more unpredictable category of costs that they come in lower. And if they come in lower, the shippers get the benefit of that lower cost as well.","Rich Kinder","Just rolls into the tolls, John. If it comes in higher on the uncapped portion, the tolls increase; it comes in lower, then tolls [ph] decrease.","John Edwards","Okay. That makes sense. And then, just on the schedule, I think the last schedule you shared with this was fourth quarter 2019 or end of 2019 start-up. Is that factoring in any expected litigation, how should we think about that?","Steve Kean","We still view the project and services, the end of 2019; so, really think of 2020 is being when the revenue starts to arrive. And the schedule we\u2019re billing takes into account what we think we\u2019re going to encounter include the need to deal with litigation as obviously.","John Edwards","Okay, great. And then, the other thing I just wanted to touch on briefly was just every now and again, we hear these rumors flying around about the sale of the KMI E&P business. You had some discussion last year; it sounds like we hearing some rumors fly again. We\u2019ve always thought about it that you would sell down, if it could be effectively balance sheet accretive, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t do it. Any other comments you could share with us in that regard?","Steve Kean","We don\u2019t comment on that kind of transaction activity. But, I can tell you what we -- the same things we talked about, I think last quarter and we\u2019ve talked about in conferences in between which is that we like that business. We get good returns in that business. We\u2019ve built a particular proficiency in that business in the EOR part of it, the midstream part of it, the source and transportation part of it. We integrated forward into EOR, because we\u2019ve got a scarce resource and that is CO2 and that resources is essential to getting certain barrels of oil out of the ground and we figured out how to do it.","So, we\u2019re happy to have that business. We are a shareholder-directed Company and we entertain in any context really something that will give us the opportunity to increase shareholder value including the disposition of an asset that we own as we\u2019ve shown through this year. But again, this is a business that we like. We don\u2019t have to do anything with it. The considerations around it in addition to the ones that you mentioned, John, have to do with, if you did a disposition and likely it would be DCF dilutive and is the multiple uplift that you get on the remaining cash flows because the deal is more secure enough, so that the day following, your investors are better off and so that is a very important constraint as well.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Abrams from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Go ahead, please.","Tom Abrams","Thanks a lot. A couple of segment questions. One is back on CO2, is the 8% decline something that is given your current spending and projects timing, is that 8% something we should assume for the next few quarters or is it something that accelerates or even declines?","Steve Kean","The way we invest in that business is not based on a decline rate or offsetting a decline rate or holding a decline rate, we\u2019re reversing it. It\u2019s really based on individual projects and whether the incremental oil that\u2019s produced for that capital is going to pay us handsome enough return for us to make that investment. So, that\u2019s the way we do it. And we don\u2019t plan for it, can\u2019t forecast for you a targeted decline rate or a targeted level of production. We address the project opportunities as they come forward and fund the ones that make economic sense.","Kim Dang","And that being said, we will go through the 2017 budget next week, and I think you will see in there the 2017 production is relatively flat versus 2016. And then to answer the question that was asked earlier about the CapEx for the fourth quarter on CO2, $73 million.","Tom Abrams","Thanks for that. The other question I had left was on the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, just trying to understand a lot of moving parts there. But if you took SNG out of both years or both fourth quarters, what would be the comparison?","Kim Dang","If you take SNG out of both fourth quarters?","Tom Abrams","My impression is it\u2019s partly in 2015 but below somewhere in 2016. I just wanted to clarify the change, the rate of change there.","Steve Kean","In other words, you want a number that reflects SNG -- even though SNG wasn\u2019t joint ventured until September of this year, what would be the number Q4 of 2015 to Q4 of 2016 if SNG were out of both quarters?","Tom Abrams","Correct. Just what the underlying is doing?","Kim Dang","The underlying business in SNG is relatively flat.","Tom Abrams","Okay. ","Kim Dang","The SNG\u2019s underlying business, make that clear. Year-to-date, I think the sale probably hasn\u2019t impacted on the segment. Let me make sure that\u2019s clear, on the segment versus our plan of a little over a $100 million. Now, net to the Company, the impact is much less, because you are getting -- there is a piece of G&A that goes away, there's a piece of the sustaining capital goes away and\u2026","Steve Kean","Interest.","Kim Dang","And you have substantial reduction in interest because we use the proceeds to pay down debt.","Operator","Next in the queue is coming from the line of Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Go ahead, please.","Sunil Sibal","Most of my questions have been asked but just one clarification. When you look at Natural Gas Pipeline segment, seems like TGP and NGPL kind of had good uptick year-over-year while other segments were probably -- other pipelines were pretty flattish. Wondering if you could talk about what kind of uptick you're seeing in NGPL and the TGP pipelines in flows or cash contributions?","Steve Kean","Yes. Project driven I would think, largely, project driven on TGP. But if you think about the prospects for those systems just looking at the underlying fundamentals of the flows et cetera, TGP continues to be a system that grows in value. The return of growth in Marcellus and Utica will just drive that further. It's participating in Mexico market demand expansion, it's participating in LNG markets expansion and it's participating in the power sector, and it's had record power data I think this year time if I remember right. Same thing with SNG, very strong, NGPL is also benefiting from volumes coming in from REX -- on REX West, well that\u2019s a Marcellus-Utica phenomenon as well and then hold on the downside from Sabine Pass on the bottom of the system from Sabine Pass and some incremental power demand and growth into Mexico. So, all three of those systems I think are doing well, have good underlying fundamentals.","Sunil Sibal","Any update on re-contracting for some of the contracts rolling off on NGPL?","Steve Kean","Contracts going off on NGPL, generally the re-contracting is done\u2026","Rich Kinder","[Multiple Speakers] I mean some of our bigger customers who actually have long term commitments as long as 10 years, but the regular tenure on some of the more traditional LAC [ph] customers are every three years and we\u2019re we still think that will add better rates than some instances than we\u2019ve seen in the past. And there seems a bigger interest in the projects that we're working on NGPL as well. So, I think the prospects are very good for all the reasons that Steve just mentioned as far as the drivers.","Operator","Alright, thank you. Speakers, at this time, we don\u2019t have any question in queue.","Rich Kinder","Okay, Thank you very much. We appreciate you all sticking with us for a pretty long call, and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you everyone. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"12450":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Vance. And thanks for joining us today for our Analyst Call. Before we begin as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. And we encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","Before I turn the meeting over to Steve Kean and Kim Dang to review the fourth quarter 2015 financial results, and other important developments during this period, I'd like to talk a bit about the future of the company. We will be delving into the 2016 outlook in more detail at our upcoming investor meeting next week but I believe it's important to focus on a few key points.","KMI's underlying business remains strong even in this challenging environment. Our year-end results turned out very consistent with what we projected to you in our third quarter call both from a DCF standpoint and a debt-to-EBITDA standpoint. This says to me that our fundamental businesses are doing well, notwithstanding the current weakness in our industry.","The fundamentals don't seem to matter in this Chicken Little-The Sky is Falling market, but they should prone to long-term investors. We are a generator of a tremendous amount of free cash flow about $5 billion per year and that's after we've paid all of our operating cost, our interest expense and our sustaining CapEx. Now, there are several ways we can utilize that cash flow.","We can de-lever the balance sheet and totally fund our growth capital needs and\/or return cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend and\/or buying back shares. We have significantly reduced our anticipated capital expansion expenditures for 2016. You'll hear more details on that from Steve today and at our investor conference. And that's a trend you can expect to continue as we high-grade our capital investments and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate.","As we reduce those expenditures, we will obviously have more cash to continue to strengthen our balance sheet and return to our shareholders. Reducing the dividend was not an easy decision, but given the strength and sustainability of our business and the cash generated thereby, I believe is the largest shareholder you will see KMI emerge as a stronger company with a strengthened balance sheet, higher coverage on the dividends we pay and with no need to access to equity markets for the foreseeable future.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right. Thanks, Rich. So I'm going to cover three topics before hitting on some - a few segment highlights. First is the performance of our business in these challenging times, second is our counterparty credit risk, and third our growth capital and then I'll do some segment highlights.","So looking at full year 2015 compared to 2014, here is the summary. On an earnings before DD&A basis, three of our five business segments grew year-over-year. Gas was up 1%, terminals was up 8%, and products was up 27%. Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year-over-year, but for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar. And no surprise, CO2 was down 22% as a result of lower commodity prices.","To put this performance in context, this performance was against the backdrop of a very negative environment for the entire energy sector. On a full year basis 2014 - 2015 to 2014, oil prices were down 49%. Of course they're down further still from there. And gas was down 40%.","Oil and gas commodity prices directly affect the portion of our EBITDA, which we quantify each year. But the larger driver of our business is the demand for what we actually sell, energy transportation and storage services. That's the primary business we're in. Let's look at those numbers.","In the gas business, which provides more than 50% of our segment earnings before DD&A, our transport volumes were up 5% year-over-year and sales and gathering were up 4% each on a full year basis.","Our products pipeline volumes were up 3% on refined products and up 15% on total liquids transported. Now that includes crude, condensate and NGLs and those were driven by expansions and the Hiland acquisition. While most of what we handle in our liquids businesses is made up of refined products and other liquids, not crude. Crude is in the news. So let's look at our crude transportation assets.","Our Trans Mountain system is prorated. That means there is not enough capacity to serve the available demand. KMCC, Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate our Eagle Ford pipeline, its volumes have been growing through the year with our expansions. We have good contracts, we are in a resilient location in the Eagle Ford, and we have great downstream connectivity to end-user markets and storage and dock capacity. In this business, especially now, contracts matter, location matters and connectivity matters; and we have all of that with the KMCC system.","In the July first half of the year, July year-to-date numbers were about 193,000 barrels a day transported. December was just under 240,000. Now it's a much smaller piece of the overall picture, but our linked pipeline in West Texas is moving record volumes so even our crude transport assets are doing pretty well under the circumstances.","Finally the liquids part of our terminal segment, which is now 74% of the earnings before DD&A of that segment saw volumes increase 18.7% for the full year and 11.3% in the fourth quarter.","Now, granted for all of these businesses are contracts in many cases call for us to get paid whether the capacity is used or not, which is a good thing by the way. So volume is not always a perfect driver of margin, but it is a good indicator that notwithstanding drastically lower commodity prices, the demand for our specific midstream assets is really quite good. Commodity prices due directly affect us in the CO2 business and a subpart of our midstream business.","We also suffered in our bulk terminals business in coal and steel and especially from the bankruptcy of two of our important coal customers. And those things absolutely pulled back our performance without a doubt but it\u2019s important to remember particularly in times like these, that our primary business is the transportation in storage of energy commodities for a fee and that the commodities that we handle the most are natural gas and refined products.","So notwithstanding all the headwinds we faced in our business, we believe that once again we demonstrated that our large diversified portfolio or fee based assets can produce stable results even an extremely tumultuous market conditions.","Now let\u2019s talk about counterparty credit risk just briefly. We're going to talk more about this at the conference next week. We continue to monitor closely our counterparty credit risk as we always have. Fortunately, we are large and very diverse company with operations across our number of sectors and across the spectrum within those sectors.","We have a large customer base with only about 20 customers accounting for more than 1% of our annual revenues and the great majority of our customers remain solidly investment grade. The largest of those 20 customers is about 5% of our revenue and that customer is rated double A minus.","We estimate that our top 25 customers constitute about 44% of our revenue and just over 80% of the revenue from that top 25 is coming from an investment grade rated entities. We\u2019ll provide you with some more detail and more refined analysis on our customer base at next week's conference, but those are some high level indications.","And just once again, 20 customers, only 20 customers account for more than 1%. The largest of those is just under 5% and is rated AA minus. Our top 25 constitute 44% of the revenue and 80% of that is from investment grade sources.","Thirdly, we also worked hard this last quarter on securing our investment grade debt metrics for 2016 and beyond and ensuring that we can continue to invest in high quality opportunities that allow us to grow value per share.","We high graded our backlog to focus on the highest return opportunities. We\u2019re aiming to reduce spend, improve returns and selectively joint venture projects where appropriate. We\u2019ve reduced our 2016 spend that we initially announced to you by an additional $900 million, that's off to $4.2 billion we said in December and we\u2019ve reduced our backlog by $3.1 billion from the third quarter of 2015 and that was just under $1 billion worth of projects placed in service during the quarter.","That action along with retaining cash above our $0.50 annual dividend aviates the need for us to access the capital markets, showers up our investment grade debt metrics and both of those things adds stability to our outlook in difficult times while enable us to continue to grow our value over time.","Now just a few segment highlights and Kim will cover all the financial details here. Again just some operational things, natural gas as I said volumes were up 5% compared to the fourth quarter, that's higher volume on Texas Intrastates because of exports to Mexico, our throughput on EPNG, also in Mexico and power generation load.","And looking at those two sectors of demand for just a minute, so our power demand on our systems was up 10% on a full-year basis year-over-year - 10% for the fourth quarter and 16% for a full-year basis compared to 2014. And throughput to Mexico was up 22% on a year-over-year full-year basis across our systems and it\u2019s now about 2.3 to 2.4 Bcf a day on average.","Also worth reminding you, over the last two years, the Gas Group has entered into new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.5 Bcf a day and about 1.6 Bcf of that was previously unsold capacity. We now estimate that of the natural gas consumed in the United States about 38% moves in our pipes.","Now some of that is moving on other pipes too gathered into ours or delivered off of ours but 38% of the gas consumed is moving at some point on KMI pipelines and we believe that the combination of power demand, LNG exports, exports to Mexico and additional petchem and industrial demand on the Gulf Coast create a bright outlook for our gas transportation and the storage assets.","Products pipeline as I mentioned, refined products up 3% compared to 2014 and this demonstrates the upside of lower commodity prices in at least some parts of our business. And as I said earlier, total volume were up 15% with the effects of the acquisitions and expansions in our liquids business.","CO2 sack rock generated record annual gross oil production during the full year of 2% compared to 2014 it was down 11% quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter versus a record Q4 of 2014. Combined oil production across all of our fields was up 2% compared to 2014. Net NGL sales volumes were up 3% compared to 2014, and we kept a close eye on costs and produce cost savings in OpEx and sustaining capital of roughly 25% of our 2015 budget.","The terminals business was up 8% year-over-year on segment earnings before DD&A. This continues to be the tale of two businesses with strong performance - very strong performance in our liquids business which is now roughly three quarters of this segment offset by continued weakness in our bulk terminals driven again by weakness in coal and steel volumes and compounded of course with the bankruptcy of our two coal customers.","The strength of our liquids performance is driven by several organic growth projects or Jones Act vessel editions. The bulk part terminals acquisition in Houston ship channel and we continue to have a very strong outlook for the demand for our capacity in the significant positions that we have built in refined products in the Houston ship channel and in oil in Edmonton.","Finally an update on our Kinder Morgan Canada and Trans Mountain in particular. This expansion as I will remind you is under long time contracts, with customers who want to see the project built. The three key areas of focus for us now are the NEB recommended order, consultation and accommodation with the first nations and the satisfaction of the BC governments five condition. We're making progress in all three though not as quickly as we like.","With respect to the NEB, we received our draft conditions in August. We think they\u2019re manageable though we did see important changes especially around the time required to approve specific portions of the project. We're waiting to see if further process will be required by the new federal government and remain hopeful that all the work that we've done today both inside and outside the NEB process, to address stakeholder concerns will be taken into account.","We're currently scheduled to receive the NEB recommended order in May, and the order and council process to follow. We continue to make good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with first nations. We've added several mutual benefit agreements which bring actual support for the projects from a majority of the bans that are most directly affected by the project.","On the BC five conditions, the BC government has made clear that we are not there yet but have clearly left the door open to closing the gap which we are working to do. We have this project in the backlog and we're aiming for our third quarter of 2019 completion.","And with that, I will turn it over to Kim. Kim?","Kim Dang","Thanks Steve. Let me start with comparing against what we said last quarter which was that we expected to end the year with approximately $300 million in coverage, and debt-to-EBITDA 5.6 times.","Now we ended the year with almost $1.2 billion in coverage which I will take you through in a moment, that's not an apples-to-apples comparison due to the change in our dividend policy.","If you adjust the fourth quarter dividend to the $0.52 per share that we expected to pay prior to the decision to reduce the dividend, we would have ended the year with approximately $297 million in coverage, and that includes absorbing over $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter results that we did not anticipate as of the end of the third quarter to account for the Arch's bankruptcy.","On the debt-to-EBITDA side we ended the year at 5.6 as expected and I will take you through the details of the balance sheet in a moment. On the face of the gas income statement, you will see that revenue is down both for the quarter and the full year compared to the corresponding period in 2014. This quarter we've added a line to break out cost of goods sold which you can see is down more than the decrease in revenues.","As I've said the last three quarters change in revenue is not a good predictor of our performance as we have some businesses where revenues and expense fluctuate with commodity prices but the margin generally does not.","We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate or DCF per share. However, for those of you who need adjusted EPS for your models, adjusted EPS without certain items is about $0.21 in the quarter which is slightly above consensus.","DCF on the second page of the number from the press release we calculate free distributable cash flow. We generated DCF for the quarter of 1.233 billion and 4.699 billion for the year. For the quarter, DCF is down approximately 45 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year DCF is up 2.1 billion.","The increase in the full year is largely the result of the acquisition by KMI of KMP and EPB that was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and so a lot of the benefits to DCF is due to the fact that the MLPs are no longer outstanding and you can see that benefit in the line of our DCF calculation entitled MLP declared distributions.","For the quarter, the 4% reduction is primarily the result of our CO2 segment which was down about 77 million. Our terminal segment down about 20 million primarily as a result of the Arch\u2019s bankruptcy and increased interest expense and preferred interest payments.","Although we are not happy to be down 4% in light of the overall circumstances and the energy and capital markets, as Rich and Steve have both said, we believe this performance is very strong and demonstrates the stability of our assets.","For the full year DCF per share is probably the best way to look at our results because it takes into account the benefit the DCF for the merger transaction, as well as the cost of the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we issued to purchase the MLPs. For the full year DCF per share is $2.14 or an increase of approximately 7% over the $2 per share in 2014.","For the quarter DCF per share is down approximately 8% for the reasons I mentioned a moment ago with respect to DCF plus incremental shares issued to finance our projects and to reduce leverage.","The $0.55 in DCF per share for the quarter and the $2.14 per share for the year results in coverage for the quarter of about $950 million and year-to-date coverage of $1.18 billion. As I said a few minutes ago, if we had paid the dividend of $0.52 in the fourth quarter, coverage would have been around 300 million just under versus our budget of 654 million. So let me give you the major components of the $350 million change versus our budget.","If you utilize the commodity sensitivity metrics that we gave you last January of $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude and $3 million in DCF for every $0.10 change in natural gas, the impact of our full year results was approximately 246 million.","We have additional commodity price impact of a little bit over $20 million most of which is due to deterioration and the crude to NGL ratio meaning that NGL prices deteriorated more than crude prices and we budget this for our constant ratio.","In directly, commodity prices impacted us by another 117 million due to three primary things, lower CO2 sales volumes, lower gathering and processing volumes in our midstream on our natural gas segment and a weaker Canadian dollar so the FX impact impacting our terminal segment and our Kinder Morgan Canada segment.","Total bankruptcies impacted us by over $65 million which was Arch and Alpha. So you take those items that I just went through that accounts for about \u2013 over $450 million, so well more than the total variance of about $350 million.","There are lots of other moving pieces both positive and negative but the primary offsets to the $450 million were lower interest expense and CO2 and other cost savings.","Now let me give you a little more granularity on where we ended up in the segments versus our budget. Natural gas pipelines ended up about 1% above its budget, as the positive impact of the Hiland transaction, better performance on the taxes interest dates, SNG and TGP were largely offset by the impact in our midstream group of lower commodity prices and lower gathering and processing volumes.","CO2 ended the year approximately 15% below its budget as we projected last quarter. This as we have discussed is more than our commodity price sensitivity would indicate and it's driven by lower crude oil volumes, lower CO2 volumes and lower capitalize overhead as a reduced as a result of reduce expansion spending offset by over $40 million and cost savings.","Terminals ended the year approximately 10% below its budget versus the 6% we discussed last quarter with the primary variance being the Arch's, the impact of the Arch's bankruptcy. The terminal segment was negatively impacted in its budget by lower coal and steel volumes again the largest piece being the Alpha and Arch bankruptcy and also the FX impact of the weaker Canadian dollar.","Products ended the year approximately 2% below its budget and the positive impact of the Double H. Pipeline which was acquired in a Hiland acquisition as slightly more than offset by approximately $24 million of commodity price segregation consistent with the sensitivity. Lower volumes on our KMCC pipe than we budgeted and lower margins in our Transmix business.","Finally as we discussed last quarter, KMCC was below its budget for the year by approximately $20 million due to FX. On the expense side, interest cash taxes and sustaining and CapEx all came in lower than expected, therefore positive variance versus our budget and that was somewhat offset by higher G&A.","The negative variance in G&A is driven by the Hiland acquisition and lower capitalize overhead as a result of lower expansion capital spending. On interest, the incremental interest is associated with financing the Hiland transaction was more than offset by lower balance than our budget and lower rates when you take up the impact of the Hiland transaction.","Finally we expect cash taxes and sustaining CapEx, they came in lower than our budget or they were - another way, they were favorable variance. There are couples of certain items in the quarter that I just want to highlight for you, one we reported an estimated $1.15 billion non-cash goodwill impairment on our midstream natural gas assets. We also reported approximately $284 million in impairment on other assets primarily in our CO2 segment.","These impairments were driven by the lower commodity price environment and also by lower stock prices. Let me give you this warning, if commodity and equity prices continue to fall, then there is \u2013 then we may have impairments in future quarters.","We also reported it as certain item in this quarter a $200 million benefit associated with the contract buyout payments that we received on Kinder Morgan's Louisiana pipeline. And with that, I\u2019ll turn to the balance sheet.","On the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with net debt of $41.2 billion based on $7.37 billion of EBITDA that gives us a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.6 times again consistent with where we thought we would end.","The $41.2 billion is a increase in debt of $610 million for the full year and it\u2019s a decrease in debt of $1.235 billion for the quarter. So let me reconcile first the quarter, $1.235 billion decrease in debt.","We spent about little under $940 million on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We issued equity of about $1.58 billion. The contract buyout that was received on KMLA was $200 million and we received an income tax refund of little over $150 million and then working capital and other items were a source of cash of about over $240 million.","Now let me say that here you would expect I talked about coverage in the quarter being $950 million but that coverage is based on the $0.125 dividend the $953 million. What we actually paid in the fourth quarter was the dividend that we declared in the third quarter, so the $0.51. And so when I'm reconciling the debt, the $0.51 dividend is what was paid in the quarter and the cash that went out the door. So you do not see the benefit in the fourth quarter yet of the reduced dividend. You will see that going forward beginning in the first quarter.","For the year, the change in debt was an increase of $610 million. We spent about $6.9 billion in cash on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. Hiland was $3.06 billion and then we spent about $3.4 billion in expansion CapEx. Those are the major components of the $6.9 billion.","We made a pension contribution of $50 million. We issued equity including the preferred $5.4 billion. The contract filed on KMLA was $200 million. We received $347 million in income tax refund. And then we had about $400 million of coverage and other working capital items that was the source of cash. And that gets you to the $610 million increase in debt.","And so with that, I'll turn it back to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay. And Vance, if you will come back on, we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question on queue comes from Mr. Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.","Brandon Blossman","Let's see on CapEx and the high grading process for the growth CapEx backlog, Rich or Steve, can you just walk through the process of how you evaluate each project in that context and what thoughts go into, whether you go forward with the project or not. Related to counter parties and related to return metrics and obviously, you're out of the market so the current yield shouldn't matter to you, but obviously you have some metric or hurdle rate internally. Has that changed at all over the last six to 12 months?","Steve Kean","Yes. We've elevated our return criteria. And look, the way we've gone through our project backlog is to take out of it things that we haven't committed to that are - that don't need current return hurdle. And I won't tell you exactly what that is, but I think a reasonable benchmark is I think mid-teens returns after tax.","Okay. And what we're trying to do is really make sure that we're investing capital on the highest return opportunities that we have, make sure that we're fulfilling our commitments and delaying spend where it can't be delayed or deferred. And taking on partners where it makes sense for us to take on partners.","And I think what we've been able to do successfully over the years is originate really good returning midstream energy projects. And so because we're able to do that even though we're viewing our capital as quite finite, there are people out there who are happy to participate with us as partners and we're exploring those opportunities where those makes sense.","So we think our returns are adequate on separable projects that could be joint-ventured. They're quite good and we think people will be interested in joining us in those projects. We would continue to build it, own it, operate it, et cetera, but it gives us an opportunity to free-up capital to deploy and higher return opportunities or to use with the balance sheet or to ultimately in the longer term return cash or increase dividend is just depending on what the circumstance is - what appears to be most rewarded at the time.","So it's really doing economically rational things like deferring stands where you can. We flushed out some scope changes, cost savings, other things that are real improvements to the economics, finding joint venture partners where those things makes sense and channeling the capital that we have to the highest returns that are in the backlog right now and potentially to some new projects so again our capital constrained for that.","Brandon Blossman","That's quite helpful, actually. I guess same topic or same general topic, different item. To go ahead expected in May, what's the process with Shell in terms of getting formal approval or FID for that project and have you had any communications or color?","Steve Kean","Yes, it's under contract and it's approved to go forward. And just again a reminder on that, that contract is - we're not taking commodity risk on that facility. Shell has signed up for a 20-year contract. They'll make this part of the L&G that's in their portfolio.","So we're not taking - they're entering into internal use agreement essentially with us on that project. They also have enough of a portfolio around the world that they don't need and it's not hinged on depended upon non-free trade act approval. So that project is very much a go from our perspective.","We do need our FERC 7C certificate and we're in that process now. We filed for it and expect to get it in roughly second quarter - yes, okay, second quarter. And we have applied for and think we should be able to obtain non-free trade agreement authority too to take that commodity - for Shell to take that commodity to other places. So our things are proceedings very well there.","Brandon Blossman","So the FTA approval is just an incremental benefit to Shell, it's not \u2013 it's not - ","Steve Kean","Right, non-FTA. Yes. They can go to Free Trade Act agreement to country as it is.","Brandon Blossman","So it sounds like it's essentially a go assuming that the FERC timeline hits on the, kind of the May or midyear time frame.","Rich Kinder","That's correct, right.","Steve Kean","That's right.","Brandon Blossman","Any color or commentaries around construction cost? It presumably gets to be an easier project to give in where we are in the macro environment and labor cost and all of that good stuff.","Steve Kean","Yes. Now it's a fair point. The construction environment for L&G facility is improving. And we're - we are working on an EPC contract and we have plenty of interest in that. So with an EPC contract there is nothing in this world that's turnkey and anything that's this complex, but that allows us to shift a considerable amount of the construction risk to the contractor.","Brandon Blossman","Okay. Well, that sounds like all good news. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue for further questions. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ms. Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Kristina Kazarian","I really appreciate the CapEx. Now my quick question there - I don't know if I missed it at some point during the call. But did you guys give an update on net and how I should be thinking about that and where it sits within the growth backup?","Steve Kean","NAD is in the growth backlog. Without commenting on any really specific project, because you got competitors and customers there. I think just more broadly, we are going through the process that I described earlier on the backlog and looking at the whole thing and where appropriate taking joint venture partners, et cetera.","So really I mean you can think of that processes we're evaluating and looking as is applying to a large part of our backlog.","Kristina Kazarian","I probably just want to make sure it's still in there. And then you guys gave a lot of great clarity around counterparty details. So thanks for this, but to hop on lower end to the scale. If I aggregated counterparties that were like 10 minus or below, do you know how large that number would be as a percent of revenue? And just how I should be thinking about that?","Steve Kean","I do not have that at my fingertips, but let me tell you what we're going to try to accomplish by the time we see you all next week. We're going to have the numbers that I took you through with a little more specificity and maybe some refinement to them. And we're also going to be trying to quantify at least in select cases, a net exposure number.","So in other words, you can't think of exposures and gross terms, you have to think of the value of the thing that you're selling if you resold it in a market. And so we're looking at some of those things too to give you a little bit more color around it.","I mean I would say that generally when we look at our top 25 customers, we pick those as a fairly representative grouping. And as I said that's about 44% of our revenues.","Kristina Kazarian","And lastly, Rich maybe to get you to pontificated that I get this question all the time. Can you just may be touch on high level what you think is going on out there like, I mean you spend roughly a month and since we had the dividend cut to reach that market expectations, but there is still like a lot of volatility. How are you thinking about what\u2019s generally going on in our market?","Rich Kinder","Are you talking about that market in general or Kinder Morgan\u2019s specifically?","Kristina Kazarian","I\u2019m doing both of them.","Rich Kinder","Both of them. So I\u2019m good at pontification as long as I follow Mark Twain\u2019s old saying, making predictions is difficult particularly when they concern the future. But I think looking at where we are today, I mean I\u2019m obviously very disappointed you would expect and where the KMI stock prices is and the way we -- the market is treated as post the dividend. We thought we took a great deal of uncertainty out of the equation.","And as I said the key fundamental thing is the amount of distributable cash flow we produce. And of course valuation one-on-one would say that regardless of what you do with your free cash flow, your distributable cash flow whether you dividend it out, put it in the new projects as long as those are good new projects and ours are or a buyback stock or pay down debt, really should make no difference from a evaluation standpoint.","But clearly parts of the market are not on that same page. I believe that long term, the fact that we have no need access equity markets not just for \u201816, but for the foreseeable future and that we will self-fund our capital expenditures our growth capital should in the long run I think be a very solid underpinning to this company and we\u2019re going to be able to return a lot more money to our shareholders in the long term as well as de-lever the balance sheet.","I think as far as overall market is concerned, I said in the opening remarks it seems like a chicken little disguise following market. There seems to be no discrimination among based on quality or based on virtually anything it\u2019s just if oil prices go down, sell everything in the energy sector. I think that\u2019s a very wrong headed short-term view, but the market is what the market is. And obviously we believe we\u2019re tremendously underpriced. If you look he is a company that\u2019s going to have close to $5 billion of free cash flow in the total market capital, but this level is $27 billion, $28 billion. I\u2019m afraid to even compete that it upsets me so much. But that\u2019s my feeling on it, probably more than you wanted to hear. But as a larger shareholder I can tell you its very frustrating.","Kristina Kazarian","I say congrats on the DC up number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin","Coming back to the CapEx here, the projects the $3.3 billion, how much of that is for projects that should come into service say in this year or maybe in the next year? How much EBITDA should we be looking for there versus how much of these more the longer lead time type projects?","A \u2013 Steve Kean","Yes. I don\u2019t have off the top of my head breakdown on the timing on in service for the remaining $3.3 billion. I mean it\u2019s going to be a combination. I mean we will give you updates when we get together next week about the projects and the associated in service states and things like that when we have a conference next week.","Rich Kinder","Ted, one way to look at all this and Kim will take you through more of this next week. It\u2019s hard to predict what is going to happen. There are so many winds blowing in all kinds of directions in this market, but I think we can give you some guidance. The fact that you look at what our backlog is which we\u2019ve reduced but that backlog should produce a certain level of cash flow; and if we\u2019re funding it ourselves, you don\u2019t need to deduct interest from that or additional equity issuance. You just look at how much that backlog is going to produce as the figure goes through the book.","And then you can add that on to whatever view you want to take of commodity prices or anything else. There should be a pretty simple way of looking forward and implying your own -- applying your own view of the bigger markets. And we\u2019re going to move down that line and show you some of that at the investor conference next week.","Ted Durbin","Just on terminals here, we had a tough quarter. I guess thinking through to \u201816, how much of that is going to flow through, what do you have in terms of the minimum volume commitments, and how those run off annual, and maybe even over multi-year view on terminals.","Kim Dang","As you saw today in the press release, we revised the 2016 budget. And so both the Arch and the Alpha bankruptcy, we have taken into account in the 2016 budget.","Ted Durbin","And then if I could just squeeze one more in just on the hedging. Where are you guys on hedging in the CO2?","Kim Dang","On CO2 hedging for 2016 about 70% hedged at $69; in 2017 $54 to $73; 39% in '18 at $75; and 21% in'19 at $65.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Jeremy Tornet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tornet","I was just wondering if you could walk us through more on the high grading the project. As far as that applies to CO2 in what prices do you guys need to see out there to deploy capital or what still makes sense in this commodity price environment? Could you would help us get sense of that.","Steve Kean","Yes. So CO2 has been a multi-part capital review, because we've been keeping up with commodity prices as they have come down. And so what we're spending money on we put incremental capital into CO2. What we're looking at is getting a very good return in upper teens plus 20 plus percent after tax on leverage return incrementally. Meaning for the oil that, that particular program or that particular development is going to produce at the current forward curve.","And then we also look at when we're doing the evaluation, we look at what an NPV15 breakeven price is for crude, so that we can kind of see how much if you will headroom or how much room we have to have that be a successful program if we proceed with it. So we've been -- as prices have been coming down, we've been bringing the CapEx down and we've been eliminating programs. It still makes sense to invest in some programs, but you're going to see a lower CapEx number for CO2 for 2016 than probably we've ever had, but still some pretty decent production with that plan. So we keep bringing it down and we look at the price those two ways.","And the third thing I would say about the way we evaluate it is that these are programs spans, right, so what you're doing is you say, okay, we're going to do this many infills in South Iraq.","Okay. So we're going to go out and do infills. The infills produce oil that tends to be front-end loaded, but if they\u2019re not performing the way we think they should or the prices isn\u2019t where we think it needs to be, then I\u2019m just picking out infills is probably a pretty high-return, high-end project for us.","But just to use it as an example, we have the flexibility to scale that program back and not deploy that capital. So we have high graded the CO2 capital, kept up to date with what commodity prices are although as you know and as you can see from today, that\u2019s a day to day exercise, but we also have flexibility in the spend when we do deploy it.","Jeremy Tornet","I was wondering as well on the gathering and processing business. Thoughts that you guys have as far as visibility into volumes and if you could help us things like that and where producers are, because everything is changing in so rapidly so just wondering how you think about that and what risk you see to that part of it?","Steve Kean","I\u2019ll start and let Tom pick up with additional detail. The gathering and processing a part of our business that really has two parts to it. I mean there is a piece of that business that is secured under transport agreements with minimum takes that look something like, which you would see in a gathering agreement or a fee-based processing arrangement, which looks something like you would see in the rest of our business.","The second part of that business is percentage of proceeds. Kinds of business where we are more exposed to commodity price. We've picked up some of that with open owe and some of that with the Hiland acquisitions as well. So you have to kind of break it apart and we're talking about seeing if we can break that up further, quantify that further so that people can see the two parts of that business.","What we\u2019re trying to do on the percentage of proceeds part is to try to migrate that more to fee based so we're kind of in the start of that process right now, but we do have exposure there. So then that becomes commodity price assumption driven: what do you think commodity prices are going to be, what do you think processing spreads are going to be, and we made some high level assumptions in the budget including a NGL price deck that we use.","And so we think we\u2019ve calibrated that reasonably well. But there is certainly variability in part two of that business as I have mentioned it. Tom, anything more?","Tom Martin","Yes. I mean I would just overall volume trend. I think we would be better than our peers. I mean our network is in -- I would say the premiere locations of all of these base, but I mean -- there is no question as you trend in time, these little commodity prices you\u2019ll see lower volume activity. But again as Steve said, there is a high degree component on many of these agreements where we have some fixed component for that. So it's really just on that the volume-metric component of the overall [indiscernible] there could be.","Jeremy Tornet","And then just to make sure I had right as far as the capital market activity for '16. Was there no activity for equity and was that no activity on the debt side as well, did I guess that right?","A \u2013 Kim Dang","We\u2019ll go through that at the investor conference that\u2019s generally what we are thinking.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","So there has been some questions about what\u2019s involved in raising the hurdle for growth CapEx and kind of trying to hold CapEx portfolio down to the point of a what was raised by Steve that, you definitely kind a view a limited amount of potential spent we had. And hence looking for third party capital or JV relationships. Is there a particular absolute or proportion of DCF that on average annual spend you kind of see as your sweet spot?","Steve Kean","I think -- look, again you got to break all these things down. If you look at some of the capital projects that we do that are, if you will, build outs of our existing network, those things are very high returning projects; and they\u2019re on our networks, so it is not like we\u2019re going to look for a JV partner on them. And in many cases like where it\u2019s building out connections or adding some capability in a terminal or something like that it\u2019s really not -- it\u2019s not separable and we can do it or we can get relatively quick and early returns and generally good returns for it.","And then there are projects, maybe at the other end where they are quite attractive for market return. They're probably less of return than what we are looking for on an incremental-investment basis and they\u2019re separable, identifiably separate from the rest of our network and those would be obvious JV candidates for us. But look what we\u2019re trying to mainly do here is we\u2019re trying to make sure that we first and foremost defend our debt-to-EBITDA metrics and maintain a secured investment grade rating.","And the CapEx that we spent in 2016 drives that. So we\u2019re going to be very mindful and we are going to treat it as finite and precious, and we\u2019re going to allocate to the highest available returns that we have. But there are going to be projects that we are going to have the opportunity to do and we're going to continue to do those.","And we're going JV the ones that are if you will amendable to being JV where we continue to build the projects operated and known significant interest in it, but we maybe bring third-party capital in order to help cover some of that cost. So I mean broadly that is how we\u2019re looking at these things going forward.","Craig Shere","That helps us and makes sense. I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is on an absolute basis when you think about getting your arms around the balance sheet achieving the transition, if there was a large chunky position in the growth CapEx inventory, the dropped out. Would that change? How you look at new projects and alternatives?","Rich Kinder","Well, look I think you have to look at what the situation is when and if that occurs. Obviously in today's market if something happen, we'd love to be buying stock at this kind of ridiculous level. But that may not be the case a year or two years from now. If the market's more rational, we might use that to increase the dividend. We're certainly going to be continuously mindful. Steve said that keeping our investment rate grading and maintaining a real solid balance sheet.","Yes, but just very simplistically and we outlined this in the release today. Even after we've done revised budget reducing measurably the commodity assumptions and raising the interest rates projection in accordance with the fall recurred, we do all that and we still have $4.9 billion of DCF for the equity holders.","You deduct the roughly $150 million in preferred dividend leaves you about $4.7 billion available to the common. You pay $1.1 billion in the reduced dividends that leaves to $3.6 billion. And as we've said, we've reduced our capital expenditure program to a little less than $3.3 billion.","Now there is a heck a lot of a lot of other moving [parts in administration]. When you just look at very simplistically the ability to fund a capital project program, we can do that. Now to extend to that $3.3 billion is something less than that, that would free up more money to either further deliver the balance sheet or return to shareholders through one of the two methods that we've talked about.","So I think the real message here guys is we are self funding now. Okay. And I got to tell you that o me that's a big relief, nobody is affected any more than I was by the division cut. Okay. But the point is we are building a very solid, stable, balance sheet with the ability to return an awful lot of cash to our shareholders over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. John Edwards with Credit Suisse.","John Edwards","Rich, given the market circumstances I guess as best can be expected. I'll just ask a couple of questions. I'll save the rest for next week, but I'm wondering on your contracts, particularly the natural gas sector. Are you seeing rates fall, contract rolls and then what's kind of your average contract tender now? And if you're seeing rates come down a bit, kind of order of magnitude if you could give us a ballpark?","Steve Kean","I think Tom can weigh in here. I think we have - we continue to see good strength on our renewals in our Texas intrastate business. S&G is very strong. TGPD, eastern pipes are very strong. The other place where we've seen and we've seen at some this year already, John is on some of the pipes that are exporting out of the Rockies.","So there we've seen deterioration on renewals. But generally speaking, we've got a great set of natural gas assets and very strong, I think well positioned for the longer term. If you look in the appendix to our normal investor presentation deck, you'll see a layout of contract tenders for each of our business units. And we'll have an updated version of that for everybody next week.","John Edwards","And then how do you view the probability now on -- I think you had the supply path and the market path on North East Iraq. You had secured -- you had obviously roughly secured one of those paths. What do things stand on the rest of it?","Steve Kean","I think we continue to make progress there. And as I said, we'll continue to evaluate it as we evaluate all the projects that we have in the backlog.","John Edwards","And then just the last thing. In terms of the change in capital spend, you already alluded to the fact that a lot of that because of the fall in commodity prices. So you're taking out of it on in the CO2 segment and then you've raised the hurdle rate as well. I guess if you could -- what's contributing to that not so about? Just range about how much you raised your hurdle rate overall, that will be great.","Steve Kean","Yes. On the CO2 we'll have all the expansion capital laid out by business unit next week and you'll see what makes up that $3.3 billion. And that\u2019s got everything in it, including assume the acquisition. So we'll give you the full price down of that. And as I said a little earlier in the call, I mean you got to look at every project individually and how secure the contracts are, what are the credit worthiness of the counter party is, how secure the revenues are, whether they're upside, et cetera.","But we have been elevating what we are evaluating, investing in to kind of a mid-teens after tax return area. And so we may be waiting to see that, right. We'll see some of those opportunities on build out of our existing network, but we're prepared to wait and see if that's what it takes to make sure that we're allocating capital to the best opportunities.","John Edwards","And just my final one is just I kind of ask you Kristina's question a different way. How much revenue faces credit risk? In terms of what's the risk of loss? You went to a lot of details and everything, but if -- I mean what you say it's 1% or 2% of EBITDA overall or is it something more? How should we think about that?","Steve Kean","It's hard to quantify the answer to that question. I think you take comfort in the fact that we've got a very diverse set of customers. It's a relatively small number that amount to even more than 1% of our revenue. And one quick clarification there, revenue is an interesting subject when you're thinking about something like the Texas Intrastates where the revenue moves with the cost of goods sold and revenue move kind of in tandem with commodity prices. In that case we look at margin, all right, but --","John Edwards","I mean margin, Steve. If you know what I'm getting at.","Steve Kean","So I think you can take comfort in the fact that there is a relatively smaller group of customers that even amount to 20% or 1%, 20 customers amount in 1% or more. And the top 25 customers, 80% of that is investment grade. And I don\u2019t have better specific data points to give you than what I did, but I think that -- I think we compare favorably to a lot of other people in our sector when you consider those matrix versus with a lot of other people are facing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ms. Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","This may have been already answered. I'm sorry if I missed it on the $900 million CapEx reduction. Did you specify where that was coming from?","Steve Kean","Not specific. We talked about CO2 a little bit and answered one of the questions that came, but we had a combination of efficiency gains, I recall where we reduce scope or found a cheaper way to do things we did, cancel some projects or assume a way some previously unidentified acquisition that was probably on the order of two thirds of that number cancelled or -- cancelled or suspended or just assumed a way, right, that we wouldn't do as many acquisitions as we had in our previous budget expectation. So that would be the biggest chunk of it, but it is a combination of things.","Rich Kinder","But we're going to break those down, business segment by business segment at the conference next week. So you can see kind of where the changes are between where our original budget was and where we are now.","Becca Followill","And so there is not one specific project that accounts more a majority of that?","Steve Kean","No, no.","Becca Followill","And then on NGPL does -- with your acquiring an additional stake in it, are there -- is there any CapEx in there or in your budget allocation for an equity infusion or what are the plans there on NGPL?","Steve Kean","We did assume some capital in NGPL. We do have some pretty attractive expansion projects there that we and our partner intend to go forward with. And that will be -- that will just be a subpart of the gas group. I'm not sure we're going to be breaking that out separately.","Becca Followill","But in terms of an equity infusion there is nothing that seemed in there?","Steve Kean","No. We do assume that we will be putting some capital and to NGPL to help support project development for next year.","Becca Followill","That will be on project development, no additional equity infusion?","Steve Kean","Yes.","Kim Dang","There are some.","Steve Kean","There is some.","Rich Kinder","Yes, there is.","Becca Followill","There is some in there?","Rich Kinder","Yes. That's Kinder budget.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. [Bill Green] [ph] with E&P Investments. Sir, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Primarily for Rich. I'm a very substantial shareholder - family shareholder since 1990, the late 90s when you went public. And the stock seems to be as you've indicated ridiculously cheap, but it's a dividend orientation. Return of capital, dividend orientation. So the question is with all these moving parts that you've described and you went through description before about the balancing act between the capital spending and the growth. And I'm just doing a little back of the envelope or is it been taken care.","If you kept to the 10% dividend increase that you had promised originally, if there had been no trouble in the credit markets the way there was; you would have something like a $3 dividend or $3.20 dividend five years down the road, which would have produced about an 8% yield on the $40 stock that you then had. Now you've got a stock roughly 25% of that $40.","If you look out -- I know you can't be too specific, but in terms of having a basis to buy the stock here. Obviously, the dividend in the future, three to five years down the road is going to be the crucial determinant as the capital spending starts to fade away.","So is there any kind of guidance that you can give numerically about that balancing act so that a person who says I'm going to buy a $12 stock today. Obviously if you stop the old capital spending today, you'll have a 20% return with a $2 dividend if you restored it. So the balance between the capital spending and the growth that you're going to develop for that is crucial here to get a some handle on the ultimate investment return here.","So it would be very powerfully useful to have a little more definitive color on that balancing average in terms of a five-year outlook. I mean what can we as shareholders paying $12 today look for in terms of a dividend five years down the road as the capital spending may phase down.","Kim Dang","This is Kim. I think in terms of what you can expect as a dividend, that's hard to say today. I think in terms of what we - next week at the conference as Rich - we're going to show you the portfolio the backlog of the projects that we have. We're going to give you approximate multiple that we expect to earn on that.","And so you - that is just the backlog has nothing to do with our base business, but you will get a sense for how much distributable cash flow we think will be produced from that backlog. And then people can make whatever assumptions they want to make about what happens with the base business and how - where exactly we take the balance sheet and how we return capital at some point to people whether that share repurchase or dividends or otherwise.","But as - I think there is very good financial theory that says whether a company pays a dividend or doesn't pay a dividend, it does not impact the value of the firm. So we can tell you how much cash that we're going to produce from these investments. And then I think from that you can come up with what you think the value of the stock is worth.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. But as long as you keep spending capital, you're not going to be able to distribute that and do the good things you're talking about. So there's got to be some end point here. It's sort of like the Amazon story with - in a different industry. I mean as long as you continue to spend capital at this rate, you're not going to have the funds available to distribute it in the fashion you're talking about. So how do we get some fixed, because -- ","Kim Dang","What you're saying is that the value of the firm depends on the dividend policy.","Unidentified Analyst","No, no. It can depend on a lot of different things, but I'm looking here $6.4 billion in distributable cash flow with your current capitalization would produce that $3 dividend. So are you going to get to $6.4 billion or so billion dollars five years down the road? That was sort of the original promise that Rich had made last year with the 6% to 10% dividend increase or the 10% dividend increase on the $40 stock, I mean that's why we held the stock there. I mean had we any suspicion you know - the question is getting some idea of the flow here, of the past, the past is crucial and some sense of that otherwise you got $12 stock here which is a disaster as we all agree.","So the market isn\u2019t following your line of thinking, that\u2019s the problem, the market isn\u2019t looking at the valuation of a company the way you would like it to it\u2019s because you convert it from an MLT and there is a tremendous focus on dividend and now is the fear that that dividend isn\u2019t even secure, not so much for you guys but for other people because of the way of the problem with the debt and the problem with the availability of financing given the challenges.","So the question is, that\u2019s the game here, it\u2019s a numbers game and the question is how will those numbers going to play out? Do we have a $6.4 billion DCF in the future which will be available for payment? That\u2019s the key is it, tell me if I'm wrong.","Rich Kinder","What we've tried to say is that we're going to have a lot of cash flow - just let me finish please, you can take what we have today which is roughly $5 billion of free cash flow. You can look at our backlog, we can give you an idea of what the expected return on that is and then you can take that number and let\u2019s say that\u2019s a dollar, whatever it is, per share, you can take that and add it to our present number and buildup what you think the cash flow will be in 2020 or 2021 but I want to again caution you that we have not been in this business 35 years, this is the most - more head win, side wins, anything that I have ever seen and to sit here and give you a number in 2020 would be insulting to you and to everybody else.","And what we're trying to tell you is, we've got a lot of cash flow, we're going to do that, we're going to use that in a way that makes the most sense for the company and its shareholders. And if that involves buying back shares or increasing the dividends to a level, that\u2019s what we're going to do.","We're not going to waste the dollars and the backup for that is just what Steve talked about is we're high grading, we've reduced the backlog by $3.1 billion, to the extent we reduce it further or joint venture more of the backlog, that is going to free up more cash earlier on the other end, it is going to in the long run depreciate somewhat the amount of cash we have coming out of those additional investments as a result of the backlog.","So this is what we're committed to. We showed you what we generated. We're going to generate, we generate $2.14 last year and that we think is going to grow very nicely over the years.","Unidentified Analyst","Right but the question is will the capital expenditures at some point - in other words it is very much the Amazon story, at some point we're going to stop spending and produce larger unusually large dividends. Right now if I go back to the $40 promise you were not afraid then to talk about a 10% dividend increase at that time.","So I'm assuming that that situation is still pretty much in force. It\u2019s just that the numbers have changed for all the reasons we know, but as far as the basic business is concerned which is what I'm hanging my hat on because I haven\u2019t sold a share either is whether to buy more shares based on the idea that that original promise which you made is still pretty much intact, and the way that promise is going to come to fruition is in the year 2021 let\u2019s say, we won\u2019t have the CapEx and we will be able to start distributing huge amounts of money to shareholders. I mean that's what we are all looking for I think - is that wrong or not wrong, that thinking.","Rich Kinder","I think I've answered the question and what we're trying to say is this is a very complicated world, we're generating cash flow, that cash flow we think will be increasing as time goes on and we have used this thought and we're going to look at that that time as to what makes the most sense. Of course as we finish these capital projects, we do not anticipate huge new additional capital projects but we will see what the opportunities are in those out years.","The whole thing is to create value for the shareholders and if the best way to do that is distributing dividends, that\u2019s what we're going to do. If the best way is to deal over the balance sheet, that\u2019s what we're going to do, it\u2019s a combination of all these factors, in this hectic market it\u2019s just very difficult to give you some specific number you can rely on in 2020 or 2021 but I appreciate your concern and certainly we agree with you I'm the largest shareholder, I want to see all kinds of value derived by the common shareholders of this company.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we don't have any further questions on queue.","Rich Kinder","Well, thank you very much. We appreciate you listening with us and we\u2019ll see most of you next week in Houston.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin, sir.","Richard D. Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Holly. Welcome to the Kinder Morgan Analyst Call. We'll be discussing Kinder Morgan, Inc., which I'll refer to as KMI; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, referred to as KMP; and El Paso Pipeline Partners, referred to as EPB. As usual, we're likely to make statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.","I'll do an overview of the results and recent developments, as Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, will give the details of business segment performance and discuss our backlog of future projects; and Kim Dang, our CFO, will go through the financial details for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013; and then we'll take any questions you may have.","And let me start with KMP. We raised the quarterly distribution on KMP to $1.36 for the full year 2013. We declared $5.33 in distributions. That's up 7% compared to 2012 and 5% above our original plan for 2014 of $5.28. Our full year DCF per unit, which we believe is an important way of measuring our success, was $5.39, up 6% from a year ago. Indicating how strong our performance at KMP was, our total DCF was up 28% for the fourth quarter and 26% for the full year. Segment earnings before DD&A was up 22% for the quarter and 27% for full year 2013. Steve will discuss the drivers of this growth, but overall, we were pleased with the performance of all 5 business segments. But I think particularly noteworthy were the integration of the Copano and El Paso assets in our Natural Gas group, a nice increase in refined products volumes at our Products Pipelines group and increased oil and NGL production in our CO2 segment, particularly at our SACROC Unit.","I'm also proud of the progress we've made on numerous growth projects at KMP that positioned us for a strong future. We've detailed those in our earnings release. But especially important in my view were these recent developments. First, the series of expansions on our Kinder Morgan crude and condensate line running out of the Eagle Ford into the Houston Ship Channel, where we have now committed about $1 billion in capital and we have long-term commitments for over 200,000 barrels per day when this capital is fully ramped up. Secondly, our very successful binding open season on Tennessee Gas Pipeline for our incremental North to South natural gas transportation. Third, our purchase of American Petroleum Tankers and State Class Tankers for $962 million, which we expect to close this month. Fourth, our joint venture with Imperial Oil for a major crude derail terminal in Edmonton, Alberta. And fifth, our letter of intent with NOVA to construct the new NGL pipeline from Harrison County, Ohio to connect with our Cochin Pipeline at Riga, Michigan, which in turn will transport the product to Windsor, Ontario. All these and a host of other projects result in a backlog of $13.5 billion at KMP alone and I think bode well for continued growth at KMP for the future. As we've previously announced, we expect to declare our distributions for 2014 of $5.58 per unit, and that's up 5% from 2013.","At EPB, the story is not as robust, at least not in the short term. Total distributions declared for the full year 2013 were $2.55. That's up nicely 13% from 2012. But distributable cash flow per unit was $2.62 for '13, down from $2.82 in '12. Cash generated by EPB's pipeline assets improved year-to-year, and there were a number of moving factors there. But the GP incentive paid to KMI increased by approximately $65 million as a result of the higher LP distributions and a slightly higher number of EPB units outstanding. Also, EPB faced some headwinds from 2 rate case settlements and from some contract renewals on some of our Western pipelines. The significant recent development at EPB is that Shell has notified us that they will move forward with Phase 2 of the Elba Island LNG JV, which at max volume would involve an additional CapEx of around $500 million, bringing the total investment in that facility to about $1.5 billion. There will also be additional investment and earnings for EPB from required expansion of pipelines connecting to that facility and other ancillary facilities. At EPB, as we've previously stated, we expect to declare distribution of $2.60 for 2014, and we expect to drop KMI's interest in Gulf LNG and the Ruby Pipeline to EPB during 2014.","Let me turn to KMI. I think we had another fine year at KMI. Again, I believe the numbers speak for themselves. For the full year 2013, KMI generated cash available to pay dividends of $1.713 billion. That's up 21% from 2012 and exceeding our budget number of $1.632 billion. We declared dividends of $1.60 per share for 2013. That was up 14% from 2012. And our cash available for dividends per share was $1.65 per share. With the total backlog of $14.8 billion in projects at KMP and EPB, we think we have excellent growth in the future of KMI and that, that growth will extend for years to come. We expect to declare dividends for 2014 of $1.72, an increase of 8% over what we declared in 2013.","Now I'd be remiss if I didn't speak of one other topic before turning this over to Steve. While we had an excellent year at the Kinder Morgan companies, both financially and operationally, our units and stocks underperformed the market by a wide margin. Now perhaps we failed to adequately communicate our story, although we certainly tried, and maybe we did communicate it, and the message was not accepted. I don't know the answer to which it was, but I do believe that particularly at KMI and KMP, these securities are trading at the greatest disconnect to appropriate valuation since the period in 2006, just before we took the first KMI private. Like now, back in 2006, we had an enormous backlog of projects. And like now, many experts will find that we were too big to be able to continue to grow at an acceptable rate. We proved the doubters wrong the first time around, and I anticipate the same result this time. Reflecting this belief in the Kinder Morgan companies, as many of you know, I've been a buyer of KMI shares. I've purchased over 800,000 shares in December alone. So I guess my message to those who saw the story less positively was you sell, I'll buy, and we see who comes out the best in the long run.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven J. Kean","All right. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with the project backlog. As Rich mentioned, we've been updating this backlog, really, starting with the investor conference in January of 2013 and intend to do it probably quarterly going forward.","In the fourth quarter, the backlog increased from $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion, and this is a combined KMP and EPB look. And we had that increase even though we had over $900 million worth of capital projects go into service and come off the backlog during the quarter. So the project additions grew the total backlog while offsetting the projects that went into service.","The larger projects that went into service were on our TGP system, both the Northeast Upgrade Project and the Marcellus Pooling Point Project, as well as some export coal terminal facility expansions in our Terminals business segment.","Now a few facts about how we put this backlog together. First, it's made up of those projects that we are highly confident will get done. Not guaranteed, but highly confident, high probability. We would expect to actually do more projects and invest more capital than what we have in the backlog, but until we consider project highly probable, we don't add it in.","So, for example, we don't have in the backlog our current joint venture Y-Grade project from Pennsylvania to Texas. We believe that project is very attractive as a solution for producers in the Utica and Marcellus. And we're actively marketing it, but we won't put it in the backlog until we see strong indications of commitments coming through.","Now the business unit by business unit composition and change in the backlog is as follows: the gas group went down in the quarter from $2.9 billion to $2.7 billion. That's because we had over $500 million worth of expansions come online in the gas group during the quarter, and that was partially offset by additional expansions, primarily to EPB associated with our liquefaction JV with Shell at Elba Island and the associated pipeline expansions.","One other development to keep an eye on. We had a recent very deep freeze, as everybody knows, a little over a week ago, and we were able to keep all of our firm customers whole. We met all of our firm requirements, including 2 electric generators who had firm transport capacity on us. But as most of you know, there was a lot of gas generation that was offline in the U.S. Northeast and was being replaced by more expensive and less environmentally benign fuel sources. What that tells us is that the U.S. Northeast needs a lot more firm transport, and we are actively dealing with customers to try to put something together in the way of an expansion. We think it's going to drive additional investment opportunities for us, but we're not yet putting it in our backlog.","At the Products group, it's up slightly to $1.1 billion in the backlog due out of projects further expanding our crude and condensate network in the Eagle Ford. Terminals is up a little under $200 million since the last update to $2.3 billion. We had a little under $100 million worth of projects go into service and come off the backlog during the quarter, but these were more than offset by the tanker buildouts associated with the Jones Act ships acquisition, some of those are -- which are under construction, along with additional expansions of our crude by rail capabilities.","Now there's another point worth noting here, that a lot of activity in 2 hubs in North America, Edmonton and Houston, and we are rapidly expanding our already large positions there. So in Edmonton, we're increasing our storage capability by 50% to about 6.8 million barrels and our huge position in the Houston Ship Channel by 26% to just under 40 million barrels capacity. So put that in context, we have, we believe, the largest independent liquids terminal facility in the world in the Houston Ship Channel, and we are growing that by 26% in capacity. So activities at those 2 hubs continue to drive midstream investment opportunities for us.","CO2 source of transportation, the part of the business where we produce CO2 and transport it for our use and for third-party use. We continue to see strong demand. We're up slightly here on the backlog but still rounds to $1.8 billion as it did last time. In our enhanced oil recovery portion of CO2, we're up to a little over $1.5 billion from a little under $1.2 billion in our last update, primarily due to additional projects at SACROC and in our residual oil zone recovery new developments. Now in this area, unlike the rest of our business where we're doing these expansion projects with a lot of third-party contracts, this part of our backlog can change based on changes in our development plans, and we had some changes in those plans in the quarter.","And, of course, our biggest project is in Canada, the $5.4 billion Trans Mountain expansion, unchanged from our last update. But we did cross a key milestone in the quarter. We got our voluminous facilities application on file with the National Energy Board, which starts that process under a defined time frame by the federal authorities and as we seek approval for that project.","In our recent investor presentations, we've also divided our projects across the years, and we've had some back-end loading associated primarily with TMX and some front-end loading associated primarily with just the newer projects that we've gotten developed. We've kind of a hollowed-out middle, if you will, 2014 and '15, in the backlog, and that's because it takes us a year or 2 to develop the projects. We said we would probably be filling in that middle as we took projects from development stage into end of the backlog. And that, in fact, happened. So since January, when we first did this to the current update, we've added $2.4 billion worth of projects in 2014 and '15. So bottom line is we're continuing to find new opportunities that are more than offsetting the projects we're putting into service.","So now we'll go through the segment review, and I'm just going to focus on 2012 -- full year performance versus 2012, and then a little bit about the outlook. So the gas -- starting with the gas segment. Gas segment of KMP was up 70% in 2013 on a segment earnings before DD&A on a full year basis compared to 2012. That increased the result of the drop-down transactions, TGP and EPNG, and the closing of the Copano acquisition in May of 2013. And those acquisitions more than offset the decline year-over-year associated with having divested certain assets in the Rockies associated with our El Paso acquisition. This segment also successfully -- and the corporate group as well, successfully integrated the Copano assets, and we exceeded the economics in our acquisition model for the year.","On EPB, asset earnings before DD&A were up slightly on a full year basis. The negatives, which Rich mentioned, electric generation on the SNG system and impact of rate case settlements were offset by the other EPB assets on a year-over-year basis. Looking ahead here, we continue to be very bullish on the opportunities presented by our Natural Gas Pipelines storage and processing network. We had a couple of large projects come online, as I mentioned, but we continue to add projects and overall continue to identify and capture opportunities and expansions that are driven by, one, exports to Mexico, LNG, and even Canada now, Eastern Canada; two, the demand from electric generation and industrial and petchem uses; and three, the need to transport gas out of the shale plays, primarily Eagle Ford and Marcellus. And our really epic open season on Tennessee Gas Pipeline for backhaul capacity out of the Utica and Marcellus is evidence of that. The headwinds in the gas segment are rate cases and the decline in basis spreads on some portions of our network.","CO2 segment earnings share [ph] before DD&A were over $1.4 billion for the year, up 8%. Growth was driven by higher volumes and higher prices. I think noteworthy here, oil volume growth was due to performance at SACROC, which was 32,000 -- over 32,000 barrels a day in the fourth quarter, up almost 6% on a quarter year-over-year basis and on a full year basis. Growth also came from improved volumes at Katz and the addition of the Goldsmith Unit in 2013. Katz averaged just under 2,700 barrels per day. That's up 56% from the average in 2012 and ended the year at around 3,500 barrels a day. We continue to see strong demand for CO2, and we brought on additional supplies in the quarter with the in-service of our Doe Canyon source field expansion in southwest Colorado, which came in slightly better than budget, way ahead of schedule and at higher production than planned, so a very successful expansion there. And we continue to pursue several large development projects to get more CO2 to our fields and to others.","In the Products group, segment earnings before DD&A were $784 million. That's up 12% versus last year, essentially flat to plan. It was flat to plan even though it was negatively -- essentially flat to plan even though it was negatively impacted by the California Court of Appeal's rate decision disallowing the tax allowance in the second quarter of 2013. That was offset by strong performance at Cochin, Transmix. And the Terminals facilities within the Products segment was very good work by the Products team to overcome that regulatory negative and get within 1% of plan for the year.","Also of note here is we're finally just seeing some increase in refined products volumes on a year-over-year basis, with volumes up 6.3% with Plantation, 2.6% without Plantation in Q4 and 4.5% on a full year basis. We also saw the first material increase in volumes year-over-year on our Pacific system since 2007, and we were up 2.1% [ph] on a full year basis on the mainline volumes. Looking forward, we continue to add projects to the backlog in this segment, primarily building off our KMCC system in the Eagle Ford and with additions to our Cochin system -- or additional projects in our Cochin system.","Terminals here, segment earnings before DD&A were $798 million, up 6% from 2012 but below plan. But this group had, I think, even though being below plan, had a very good business development here in terms of laying the groundwork for the future and developing additional projects. Highlights here, we started bringing online our BOSTCO terminal project in the Houston Ship Channel and our Edmonton Terminal expansion. Those projects both had expansions under contract before the first phase was done. So again, highlighting the strong demand for our services in those 2 locations. And again, we continue to identify and capture numerous opportunities for expansion there.","Kinder Morgan Canada segment earnings were $199 million for the year, down 13% from 2012 due to the sale of Express and increases in book taxes. But the main story here continues to be the expansion of Trans Mountain from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels a day, expansions under long-term contracts, approved by NEB. We've got our Facilities Application on file. We expect to complete construction still at the end of 2017.","And that's it for the segment overview, and with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.","Kimberly Allen Dang","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Just going through the numbers. Looking at the first page of numbers in the KMP press release is our GAAP income statement, and on that, you can see the declared distribution today of $1.36, which results in a distribution of $5.33 for the year. I'm going to turn to the second page and walk you through our calculation of distributable cash flow and the drivers of the growth. That distributable cash flow is reconciled to the GAAP numbers on the first page.","The $1.36 -- we generated DCF per unit, as Rich said, of $1.44, which was up 7% versus the $1.36 distribution. That resulted in $36 million of coverage in the quarter, consistent with what I told you last quarter. We expect to have positive coverage in the fourth quarter. We also have positive coverage for the year. For the year, distributable cash flow per unit was $5.39, up 6%, versus our declared distribution of $5.33. That's $22 million in excess coverage for the year. That comes in just slightly below our budget, $12 million below our budget of $34 million in coverage.","Total DCF, $635 million in the quarter. That's up $140 million or 28% versus the fourth quarter a year ago. And just to walk you through the pieces of that. The segments are up $279 million or 22%, with approximately 70% of that $279 million or about $191 million of the increase coming out of the Gas group for the reasons that Steve mentioned. $55 million is the growth in CO2; $27 million in Products; $23 million in Terminals. And then as Steve said, Kinder Morgan was down for the quarter, about $17 million due to the Express sale and book taxes. Now as you know, book taxes have no impact on our total DCF because in our calculation of DCF, we add back book taxes and subtract out cash taxes, and there was not a corresponding increase in the cash taxes. And then the Express sale overall is accretive to KMP. It's just it's negative in the segment. We used the proceeds to reduce debt and reduce our equity issuance. And so the benefit of that transaction shows up in other lines.","In the quarter, G&A expense was $127 million. That's $19 million increase in expense. That's largely associated with the El Paso acquisition and the Copano acquisition. Interest expense was $225 million in the quarter. That's up $45 million, so $45 million in incremental expense in the quarter. That's primarily associated with balance, which is up on average about $2.9 billion. And then in the quarter, we had increased sustaining capital versus the fourth quarter of last year of about $6 million. So if you take the $279 million increase in the segment, you subtract out the $19 million increase in G&A, $45 million in interest and $6 million on sustaining CapEx, you get to the $140 million increase and distributable cash flow for the quarter.","For the full year, total DCF, $2.24 billion, up 26% or $466 million. The segments generated $5.55 billion of earnings before DD&A, up $1.17 billion or 27%. Similar to the quarter as Natural Gas Pipelines, they generated over 80% of the growth. Natural Gas Pipelines was up $962 million, with the biggest piece of that coming from the drops, well north of $800 million, close to $850 million came from the combination of the drop-down assets and the -- including the half of midstream that we bought from KKR.","CO2 for the year, up $106 million; Products, up $81 million; Terminals, up $46 million; and then Kinder Morgan Canada, down $29 million for the same reasons as I discussed that impacted the quarter.","G&A expense for the quarter was $521 million. That's up $89 million versus 2012, also, largely similar to the quarter, largely as a result of the El Paso drop-down assets and the Copano acquisition. For the full year versus our budget, G&A was $19 million incremental versus our budget, so $19 million negative, associated primarily with the Copano transaction.","Interest expense was $850 million for the year. That's increased expense of $218 million, and that's a combination of balance and rate on the -- the balance on average was up about $3.6 billion. And then on the rate, the debt associated with the drop-down transaction, which was assumed with those transaction, was at a slightly higher rate than KMP's existing portfolio, and that's largely what drove up the rate.","Versus budget, interest expense was very close to budget, within $2 million, and that's -- we had increased interest expense associated with the Copano transaction, and that was offset by increased capitalized interest as a result of incremental expansion during the -- added to our expansion of CapEx during the year.","Sustaining CapEx was an incremental $42 million in 2013 versus 2012 and actually came in about $12 million positive versus our budget. Our budget was -- about $6 million of the $12 million was timing and about $6 million was incremental -- was positive capitalized overhead versus what we originally budgeted.","So that is -- that's KMP's DCF. Looking at KMP's balance sheet, I'm going to look at the bottom. Total debt -- total net debt, we ended the year at $19.5 billion in debt. That results in debt-to-EBITDA of 3.8x, consistent with where we told you we would -- last quarter, where we would end the year. Our original budget was 3.7x, but once we revised it to incorporate the Copano acquisition, we expect it to end up at 3.8x.","The change in debt for the quarter and for the full year. For the full year, I'm going to reconcile to our actual December 31, 2012 debt balance of $15.35 billion. And what you have on the balance sheet is consistent with GAAP, but it's been restated. So it's not actually a recast for common control accounting. So it's not our actual debt balance at December 31, '12. So using the actual debt balance, the change in debt for the quarter was $458 million, and for the full year, it was $4.2 billion increase in debt.","For the quarter, we spent cash on expansions and contributions to equity investments of a little over $980 million. We issued equity of almost $440 million. We had -- we received insurance proceeds of about $48 million associated with claims on Hurricane Sandy to rebuild the terminals in the Northeast, and we had coverage of about $36 million.","For the full year, we spent about $10.6 billion on acquisitions, expansions and contributions to equity investments. And then this also includes the first half of the debt associated with EPNG that came on to KMP's balance sheet when they acquired the second half.","We raised $6 billion in equity. And just as aside, we raised $1.1 billion in equity through our ATM during the year.","Express proceeds were about $320 million net of tax. We unwound some swaps for $96 million. We had contributions from our JV partners of $126 million. These are for investments or actually assets where we consolidate the asset but -- and then we get -- -- receive contributions for our partners for their share of the CapEx.","And then insurance proceeds for the full year, $89 million. And then we had a working capital, use of capital, of about $234 million, which is largely associated with AP and AR storage gas and also the acquisition expenses on the Copano transaction. So that is -- that's KMP.","Turning to EPB. The first statement, statement of income, you can see our distribution of $0.65, which is up 7%, results in $2.55 for the full year, up 13%.","So turning to the second page of numbers, our calculation of distributable cash flow, which, like KMP, is reconciled back to our GAAP income statement. We generated DCF per unit of $0.66 in the quarter versus a distribution of $0.65, so about $2 million in excess coverage. For the full year, generated $2.62 of DCF per unit versus $2.55 distribution, so about $16 million in excess coverage, and that's about $10 million below our budget due to the delay in the drop of Gulf LNG.","Total DCF was $144 million, down $19 million in the quarter. And just to walk you through that, the earnings for DD&A were $307 million in the quarter. That's down $11 million. As both Steve and Rich mentioned, primarily, the rate cases on WIC and SNG are the reason for the reduction, as well as lower contract renewals on WIC.","G&A during the quarter, $20 million expense. That's about $3 million incremental from the fourth quarter of last year. Interest is essentially flat. Sustaining CapEx was reduced expense at $15 million of about $2 million. The higher GP incentive was $7 million, and that gets you to the $19 million change for the quarter.","For the full year, the $569 million in DCF is a $21 million reduction versus a year ago. Looking at the drivers there, the assets generated about $28 million. You can see $20 million of that on the line Earnings Before DD&A. And then $8 million is a result of reduced noncontrolling interest because we acquired the incremental interest in CIG. $20 million decrease in G&A as a result of some cost savings. Interest was $11 million increased expense, primarily increase in rate as we termed up debt associated with the May of 2012 drop-downs towards the end of 2012. And then the GP incentive was higher by about $66 million.","The $28 million increase from the assets, about $40 million, so more than all of that was associated with acquisitions. And then that was offset by the rate case impacts and the other things that I mentioned impacting the quarter. That's EPB's distributable cash flow.","Looking at EPB's balance sheet, we ended the year at total debt of $4.178 billion. That resulted in debt-to-EBITDA of about 3.8x. That's up from the third quarter, 3.6x, due to some timing and working capital, which I will go through in a second. But the 3.8x is consistent, where we expect it to end what we told you last quarter.","The change in debt. For the quarter, we had a $67 million increase in debt. We spent $28 million on expansions and contributions to equity investments, and then we had coverage of $2 million and working capital and other items of a little over $40 million. And the working capital was just timing on accrued interest and property taxes.","For the full year, we had a $55 million reduction in debt. We spent over $100 million, about $104 million on expansions and contributions to equity investments. We issued $87 million of equity. We had a positive coverage of $16 million. And then working capital for the full year was a benefit or a source of about $56 million.","Turning to KMI. KMI's distributable -- or cash available to pay dividends, $482 million in the quarter. That's up $43 million or 10%. That results in cash available per share of $0.46. And so versus our $0.41 distribution -- or dividend results in coverage of $55 million.","The increase in cash available to pay dividends of $43 million, let me just reconcile that for you quickly. The cash coming from our 2 investments in the MLPs and for the investment of KMP and EPB was up $83 million in the quarter or 15%. G&A was relatively flat. Interest was a reduced interest of about $12 million. So it was a benefit, and that's largely associated with pay-down in debt as a result of drop-down transactions.","And then assets, the assets, the other assets that we own, we had a reduction in the cash that we received from those of about $31 million as a result of drop-downs. We had a $21 million increase in tax because of increased income. That gets you to the $43 million.","For the full year, as Rich said, $1.713 billion in cash available to pay dividends results in cash available per share of $1.65, which is $49 million in excess of the declared dividend of $1.60. The $1.713 billion is an increase of a little over $300 million versus the fourth quarter of last year and is also in excess of our budget by approximately $80 million.","On the $300 million increase from 2012, the cash generated from our investments from the 2 MLPs, up $505 million. G&A was increased expense of about $15 million as a result of a full year of the El Paso transaction. Interest expense was increased expense of $27 million, and that was the increased interest associated with the El Paso acquisition, offset by the pay-down in debt associated with the drop-down transaction to KMP. The other assets -- or a reduction in income of $64 million as a result of the drop-down transactions and then cash taxes, an increase of $97 million associated with the increased income, and that gets you to the $302 million.","KMI balance sheet. KMI ended the quarter at $9.8 billion in net debt. That's down from $11.4 billion at December of 2012. $11.4 billion, similar to what I explained on KMP, is our actual ending debt balance at December of 2012. What you see on the balance sheet -- the published balance sheet is a recast number. So the $9.8 billion is -- results in debt-to-EBITDA on a fully consolidated basis of 5.1x and on a stand-alone basis of about 3.5x.","The change in debt for the quarter and the year. For the quarter, we had a $48 million increase in debt, and that was -- we spent about $174 million on share and warrant repurchase. We had about $47 million in outflows associated with some legacy El Paso items, such as the marketing business and environmental. We had coverage of $55 million. And then we had other items, a source of cash of $118 million, with the largest piece of that, even more than that, being associated with the difference in the cash taxes that we have in the metric versus the cash taxes that we actually pay. Because we are in an NOL position, the cash taxes that we actually pay are much lower than what's in the metric. The metric only assumes about a $300 million use of the NOL.","For the year, the change in debt is $1.6 billion reduction. We have $2.2 billion reduction from asset sales. We have share and warrant repurchase, which is a use of cash of $600 million and almost $640 million. We have pension contribution of $50 million. Investments in the MLPs, including the units we took back associated with the dropped KMP of $66 million. Contributions to equity investments, this was before we dropped most of the investments to KMP, was $49 million. The legacy El Paso, we spent about $95 million. Coverage was a positive $49 million. And then we had working capital and other items of about -- or inflow of $232 million. Again, all of this and much more is associated with the difference between the taxes reflected in the metric and the actual cash taxes that we pay.","So that's it for the numbers, Rich.","Richard D. Kinder","All right. And with that, Holly, if you want to come back on and open the line for questions for us.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions from me. The first, and I recognize you're going to provide a lot more detail at the Analyst Day in a few weeks, but I'd like just your macro thoughts on the downstream expansion or repurposing opportunities on KMCC. And I know that you've got that lateral in Gonzales County, so that gives you access to the ship channel. And also, the joint venture with Magellan gets you there, as well as Corpus. And Steve provided a lot of detail, which we appreciate on all those terminal expansions, but when you think about the overall demand pull that drives the export of higher-end dis\/splits [distribution and splits] and gas\/oil to areas like Latin America, let's just say, if you could just outline the opportunity set and required capital that might be necessary in order to meet that demand beyond 2015, that would be helpful.","Richard D. Kinder","Well, first of all, from a macro standpoint, of course, we continue to extend KMCC outward into the Eagle Ford. And one of the benefits of the Copano","acquisition was the ability to connect KMCC to Double Eagle. And so we can now provide a producer with optionality. He can connect and either go all the way to the Houston Ship Channel on KMCC, or if he's in the right place, go down Double Eagle to Corpus. So that's our initial contribution to moving the condensate around. Obviously, I agree with you that the export of refined products is increasingly in vogue. We're handling a fair percentage now that -- in all of our assets along the Houston Ship Channel, and we will continue to expand that by more connectivity, by more berths that we are building and by more storage capabilities. For example, in conjunction with the splitter, which is an outgrowth of KMCC in which we are investing about $360 million per 100,000 barrel splitter that's fully subscribed by BP. We're building 2 sets of new tanks for that. And that will facilitate the ability to move the split product out. It's not refined products, but it will facilitate that ability. So I think we're pretty much on top of it, given all the connectivity we have. And I think we'll be able to continue to benefit from what we see as a significant trend. Steve, anything else on that?","Steven J. Kean","Yes, I mean, the KMCC right now is about 2\/3 full under contract, so there's more room for shippers to get in there. As Rich mentioned, that's interconnecting with Double Eagle, so there's really kind of a network down there right now, connecting either Corpus or the Houston Ship Channel. And then, in connection with the splitter project, we're putting in 3 new cross-channel lines between Galena Park and Pasadena, adding to the existing cross channel lines we have there, about 5, I think.","Richard D. Kinder","Six.","Steven J. Kean","Six, okay. And with BOSTCO, we're adding ship docks, adding 12 barge berths, looking at the potential to connect Pasadena and Galena Park with BOSTCO. All those things, it's very hard, Darren, to say well, how much total capital we have put to work there. It's really a question of how much growth there is. It looks like there's going to be a lot, and what customers sign up for. But we're very happy with the network that we've got and its expandability.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right. I appreciate that. And Steve, last question, I just want to go back to the comments that you made about TGP's open season for that backhaul capacity out of the Northeast. I know that you said in the prepared comments you're looking at additional expansions there, but can you just give us an idea, as you're looking at basis differentials and talking with producers, what you think the scale and scope necessary to meet the production profile to get incremental gas to the Gulf Coast could be? Because it seems like recognizing you're not going to build it before commitments are signed, but it seems like it could be significantly larger than existing capacity in the ground.","Steven J. Kean","That's -- we believe that is absolutely true, and so we're out talking to the market right now about another potential expansion. I'm sure others are as well. It may have as much to do with how much gets expanded into New England, so how much of the gas ends up going that direction or into the Northeast, generally. But we were, I guess maybe some people said they weren't surprised, I was surprised. And it was a very strong open season and it has prompted us to start very quickly on the next round. And I think we just have to see whether the first ones are cheaper, the next ones are more expensive. We have to see if the customers are there for a higher price point. And they may not be immediately, it may take some time and some build up and some ramp-up in production in the Utica for people to really get a sense of what they have, but we expect there's more to come. Tom, do you want to add anything to that?","Thomas A. Bannigan","Yes, I mean, I think the kind of [indiscernible] that we're doing out there which is","[Audio Gap]","excess of a bcf, maybe closer to 2 Bcf.","[Audio Gap]","Not all that is something we'll get, but I think it's certainly a representation of what kind of scale is out there, and we're certainly","[Audio Gap]","option that we have to head back to the Gulf Coast and\/or take it to the","[Audio Gap]","Richard D. Kinder","Look, what's happening is that the production of Marcellus and Utica is, all of you on this call know, is so huge, that while there is need for more connectivity into the Northeast, particularly New England, the amount of production there has, is in the process, and has already, in some respects, swamped the demand that can be sucked up by the Northeast. And so lines like Tennessee are obviously going to become, in some respects, bifurcated lines, they're going to move a huge chunk of gas downstream from the producing areas of Marcellus and Utica in to the North. And then, as we found in this open season, we're going to move a lot of gas south, to where we think the huge demand is going to be, down here along the Gulf Coast, with all the new downstream facilities being built. So I think it's a very good opportunity for us. The caution would be that obviously, as Steve said, that the cheapest expansability [ph], the low-hanging fruit is always the first one. And that's why I think we were so tremendously oversubscribed in the open season. But now we're working to see what the next level of demand is, and I think we'll capture some of it. Certainly, others will capture some, too.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Zarahn with Barclays.","Brian J. Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question is on the long-term distribution growth guidance. Is that unchanged with 9%, 10% of KMI, 5% to 6% KMP and EPB? And is that from a full year 2012 base?","Richard D. Kinder","Right now, we're going to be able to give you more of an update on that. We're, right now, that's certainly the last -- the guidance we've given and we've talked about that, the 5% to 6% of KMP and 9% to 10% at KMI. And now, in preparation for the conference in a couple of weeks, we're now updating that and extending it, Kim, out through 2018. So we'll have an update, we haven't even completed running those numbers, but that will give you, horseshoes and hand grenades, look, from '14 out through '18 and we'll have it for you at the conference.","Brian J. Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, we'll stay tuned on that. On drop downs, what are your thoughts regarding FGT, previously you mentioned that would dropped this year, it seems like it's going to stay a little bit longer at KMI, so any color around the ownership of FGT long term?","Richard D. Kinder","Right now, we're keeping it -- we've budgeted for the year staying up at KMI. We're just going to continue to look at it. We're going to drop the 2 other assets to EPB this year. And we just haven't made a decision on when we --","[Audio Gap]","Brian J. Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And on the marine transportation acquisition, can you provide some color on to the strategy and expanding to that business, and about the timing of the EBITDA ramp-up from the $55 million now to, I guess, to the $140 million or so you're expecting?","Richard D. Kinder","Happy to. I think some people looked at that as this was a big step out for us. And although I think most people saw through as to what our real reasoning is, but let me just take you through it. We're in the midstream transportation business, and the greatest single opportunity, and why, in my roughly 35 years in this business, this the most interesting time we've had, is we have all this tremendous increased production coming from areas, and this is true of across the board, whether you're talking about crude oil, natural gas, condensate or indirectly, even refined products. We have a tremendous need to transport that from new production areas to market areas. And there are a lot of ways of moving it, and we're primarily a pipeline company, of course. And so, the cheapest, most effective, long-term way of moving with all these products, is by pipeline. That said, and we've discussed this before, there are a lot of reasons. Some of it is infrastructure not being built on a timely basis or permitting delays. Some of it is optionality that producers or others want. But there are reasons why pipelines don't satisfy everybody's need. An outgrowth to that is obviously crude by rail. Another outgrowth of that is the Jones Act. And that's why we are pretty bullish on this area. If you think about it, if you're talking about moving crude oil, for example, from the Eagle Ford, very simple to take it down to Corpus, and you can put it on a barge and move it over here to Houston, or over to New Orleans, or you can put it on a Jones Act ship, and get take it up to the refineries in the Northeast. And I'm sure you've seen these figures, and I may be off a little bit on the numbers, but in 2011, there were something like 5,000 barrels a day moving out of Corpus. This year, in '14, I think the projection is something along the lines of between 350,000 and 400,000 barrels a day moving out of Corpus. Some of that will go by barge, some of it will go by Jones Act tanker. So we think this is an asset, the Jones Act tankers, that are very important to the energy infrastructure. And there are at least 2 or 3 ways in which they're going to grow. The demand for them's going to grow. One is, some of the Bakken crude, as you know, is now being shipped by rail, or at least there's talk of this, going to Oregon and Washington and then going down by ship to the LA and San Francisco refineries. We think that will see some growth. Obviously, another area of growth is, as the Panama Canal is completed. Increasingly, we're talking to people, no firm commitments, who think that they will use Jones Act tankers, that have to be Jones Act, to take production out of Texas and move it through the canal and back up to California. And then finally, of course, the Colonial's line is completely full on refined products, there may be opportunities to move refined products. So I think that's what's driving the increase in day rates. As you know, and we showed, I think, in our release, our average day rates under these long-term contracts are in the $55,000 to $60,000 per day range. The market today is at least $70,000, and Exxon just did a 1 year charter, which was publicized about 2 weeks ago, for $100,000 a day. And that was for 1 year, not 5 years. But we think there's going to be increased demand. We think this is a nice place to be in. We have a good operator who's doing the operatorship for us. So we look at this as an adjunct, another alternative in the area of transportation that we can offer our customers and we think it's going to pay real dividends for us. And we like the fact that we have a whole lot of this cash flow locked in, including all of the new ships being built.","Brian J. Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And on the -- I appreciate the color on the ramp-up to $140 million of EBITDA, is that sort of a 2017 time frame, would you expect?","Richard D. Kinder","Upon completion, Dax, you want to...","Dax A. Sanders","November of '15 through October of '16 are the -- vessels will be coming by.","Richard D. Kinder","So by -- everybody, all the new vessels will be on by the end of '16. So it ramps up, and I think it's actually more than $140...","Steven J. Kean","Yes, it's about $146 million.","Richard D. Kinder","$146 million, that we expect for '17, once they're all in.","Brian J. Zarahn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And just lastly from me, can you update the number of warrants outstanding at KMI?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Yes, $348 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to follow-up on some of your opening comments there and the underperformance of the stock and talking about how you think it -- maybe can you be a little more specific around any kind of actions you might actually be able to take? It seems like you alluded to it, but I'm just wondering if you can give us anything more there?","Richard D. Kinder","Well, the action I hope is that, you guys will be so impressed with our performance that the stock price will rise meteor-like. But somehow, I don't see that happening in the next 24 hours anyway. What we're looking at, trying to do a better job of communicating the story. I'm befuddled because we have this tremendous backlog, and each of these projects has so much potential. If you take the Trans Mountain expansions, and you look at the spread between our cost of capital, what we're going to make on an unlevered basis, on $5.4 billion, and start calculating that and then split it between KMP and KMI, and that alone is a huge growth mover. If you look at some of the projects in the CO2 field, where we're bringing all this additional CO2 on and the new developments in the ROZ, on the other end of it, tremendous growth. We just took our board on a tour of the Ship Channel yesterday, right here in Houston. Kinder Morgan is spending $1.8 billion along the Ship Channel. That's the total projects, along there both in the terminals and the products group. All of these are coming online. We'll fill the rest of KMCC. We started out with 1 commitment on Kinder Morgan crude and condensate, which was from Petrohawk, now BHP, for 25,000 barrels a day the first year and 50,000 thereafter. And that justified a 15% unlevered return on the $220 million investment which, as you know, we converted some of our natural gas lines to hold down the cost of the investment. Today, we've extrapolated that into spending $1 billion in the area. We now have long-term commitments for over 200,000 barrels a day, and we're going to be adding volume on top of that. That led to the split or indirectly led to the reversal of Cochin, which is about a $300 million project. You look at what we just signed up with Nova, to connect into Cochin, to the east end of Cochin, we'll be spending $300 million or so building a pipeline there. It, too, will have expansability [ph]. So I look out there, and I see this huge damn footprint across North America. And every time we turn around, we see more ability to extract value out of it, but I guess I haven't been successful in convincing the rest of the world of that, because a lot of people don't see it. That's where we think we have such an advantage and such a growth profile for the future. That's why I've never sold a share, and I just keep on stupidly buying more. But that's the guts of it, Ted, and I don't know what we -- again, we try to make these points. I'm looking at some of Kim's preliminary presentation for 2 weeks from now, I mean, it makes me sit up and take notice when you look at the tremendous growth next year. We have a growth that's sustaining CapEx next year, which we built from the bottom-up, which is a little over $100 million growth in sustaining CapEx at KMP. If we had held a sustaining CapEx flat to this year, if you just take $100 million and divide that out from what it would would've done for KMP and KMI, it would have been a whole different story. So we're going to try to do the best job we can of explaining, but we think this is an incredibly strong story. And, again, look at the footprint and look at the opportunities to expand off of that footprint.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful, and I appreciate all of the color there. Next question for me is just thinking about your Y-Grade pipeline out of the Marcellus. And I guess I'm a little worried here about any abandonment issues you might have with the FERC. You just mentioned there's tremendous trip [ph] demand with gas, north to south. Is there any risk that the FERC says, \"Hey, we need to keep this pipeline in gas service and we can't take it out of service?\"","Steven J. Kean","Yes. Look, we're in a very good position there, Ted. This is pipe that's in demand, and that's in demand for gas service and we think it may be in demand for a Y-Grade service. And so that does raise the concern that you identified. But we do think, and we're -- what we're aiming for, is the prospect of doing a further expansion on our -- on TGP to move additional gas out, and still be and able to make room for the Y-Grade. Now we'll have to do it realistically, and the Y-Grade line will have to pay for, or bear the, some of the burden of making sure that there's additional capacity on TGP to replace what's being used, but we're shooting for both. We're shooting for the expansion of gas service and the Y-Grade conversion. But you are highlighting a good problem to have, which is, we've got pipe in the ground that's in demand.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And on these -- the sort of backhauls, are you just basically targeting max rates? Is that the way we should think about that, on TGP now for the gas?","Thomas A. Bannigan","On max rates -- I mean they're -- the market rates and they're going up, so.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You've got some headroom, effectively, if you wanted to go to max, is that fair?","[Audio Gap]","Richard D. Kinder","Did that answer your question, Ted?","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, no, sorry, I was just asking, is there a lot of room between sort of market and max? I guess that's what I'm trying to ask, get out of there and --","Thomas A. Bannigan","Yes, no, there's room. I can't get into specifics, I guess we're -- we've got room between the market rates and the max rates.","Richard D. Kinder","It's actually forward moving, we're actually physically moving molecules from north to south. And I think the market continues to refer to it as backhauls, but it's an old pipeline. This is really a forward haul, and that -- those molecules are going to end up in the Gulf Coast. Tremendous demand for that, and as Steve says, it's a whale of a nice problem to have.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So a couple different questions. Let's start, maybe with LNG. How is the FTA contracting going for Gulf LNG? Any update on how you guys see authorization, authorizations coming through from non-FTA requests for Gulf and for Elba? And can you remind us, if you do get that, just how large can the growth pipeline expand?","Richard D. Kinder","Well, there's a lot of things assumed in that question. First of all, let's look at our efforts as an LNG developer. The right way to think about Elba Island, even though we're certainly like everybody else, applying for non-FTA is, we don't need non-FTA for that. And Shell, in December, just exercised its option on the first part of Phase 2. Now there's another option that can be exercised at the end of this year. But all of that, and if they exercise that second option, we will end up there with a project on a [indiscernible] basis, something in the $1.5 billion range. And it will be moving about 350 million cubic feet a day through there. That's relatively small by LNG standards, but it's a very nice project for us. We own 51%, Shell owns 49%. And in addition to that, it gave us the opportunity to spend money on other infrastructure necessary to get the LNG there and associated facilities around the terminals. So it's more than just our 51% of $1.5 billion or so. So a great opportunity for EPB. On the Gulf LNG, we continue to look at opportunities there, we talk to customers, we don't have anything to announce at this point. Another big part of the LNG story, of course, is the ability of our pipeline network to serve the LNG facilities, particularly those along the Gulf Coast. And we will have a role at Magnolia, assuming that gets built, we think we'll have a role at Cheniere, some of the additional trains at Cheniere 5 and 6. We certainly believe we will furnish a significant part of the gas at Freeport. And so all along here, we have as many miles of pipeline or more than anybody else, and the ability to connect all kinds of sources of supply and get it to these LNG facilities. And in the long run, that may be the greatest opportunity for the Kinder Morgan family of companies. We're going to continue to look at opportunities at Gulf LNG, we'll see how it plays out. We don't do anything unless we get firm commitments on it, so we'll see there, but the opportunity for serving these facilities through our pipelines is enormous, comes back to what I was saying a question ago, which is the size and scope of our footprint.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And let me follow-up on Brian's question about Citrus. How full is FTT now? Is there still that, what was it, 20%, 30% capacity on the old Phase 8 expansion that was originally uncontracted? And does the tax status have any implications of any drop-down decisions?","Richard D. Kinder","Dax, you want to answer that?","Dax A. Sanders","What was that again, Rich?","Steven J. Kean","Well, the first question was on the capacity, is there any remaining on Phase 8. And the answer is yes. I'm not sure what the percentage is. And then, the second question was on tax status.","Dax A. Sanders","Yes, the -- there's approximately 184 a day remaining of capacity, that we're still having a little bit on an interruptible basis. And we're constantly looking at the market to see what we might be able to sell on a term basis. We've had conversations with several people, talked to [indiscernible], we're getting things done on a near-term basis. And from a tax perspective, we certainly -- we have some NOLs and some depreciation associated with the Phase 8 expansion that we'll be running out over, call it, the next 4 or 5 years. And the cash tax obligation of Citrus will ramp-up over what I'd call the next 4 years, pretty substantially, so.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And last line of questioning is around the EOR ops. I noticed the nice bump sequentially from third quarter for Katz. Is that finally kind of on track with the model performance? And was the 9% jump from the third quarter in SACROC expected or well ahead of expectations? Looked like a nice jump there. And if the market continues to be flustered by that business, which I don't understand why, since you had it for so many years and it's a smaller part of business today, but if it is, would there be any way to monetize a portion of the assets to reduce the overall size, minimize production rollover concerns and help fund the growth projects?","Richard D. Kinder","Let me start with Katz. We believe Katz is on track. There are no guarantees but certainly, we've -- we just went through a review a few days ago with the CO2 team. We think it's in good shape and moving up as we said, so many times. It was a delayed response, but we believe we'll get the same amount of barrels out of there, as we expected when we first developed it. It's just they're coming a little later. SACROC, we've said before, the old phrase that Tim Bradley taught me, which was, big fields get bigger. And I think that's what we're finding at SACROC. We're just finding a lot of additional opportunities to drill there. A nice increase, that increase is continuing through January. We're averaging between 32,000 and 33,000 barrels a day there. I don't think anybody on this call's mentioned the fact that also last year, we set an all-time annual record on the NGL side at about 19,500 barrels a day of NGLs associated with SACROC. So it's going very well, and we think we're going to have additional opportunities to continue to grow SACROC. I think monetizing these assets would be very difficult. We're not in the game of selling things. We're in the game of buying and expanding, and so we don't have any intention of doing that now. And you're quite correct, I mean, CO2, we hold it to a higher level of expected return than our pipeline's investments and rightly so. And it's declining part in terms of the overall company. We're happy to have it, it's a good asset. And remember, a big chunk of it, and a big chunk of the future growth there is not on the OR [ph] side, it's over there on the S&T side where we're finding some really good ability to produce more CO2 and get it to the Permian Basin.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Right. And one last follow-up on that EOR question. Can you update us, it seems like propane's recovering, even ethane pricing to some degree. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of trends there, and also for the basis differentials?","Richard D. Kinder","[indiscernible]","Unknown Executive","Yes, we are seeing -- we typically look at NGLs as a percentage of crude, and obviously that's climbing up, primarily driven by propane. And we continue to see that. We expect that to continue to happen over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just following up a couple of the earlier questions. Just -- I'm curious on the TGP expansion on the gas side, and then comparing that to the proposal to move NGLs. I'm just curious, which opportunity do you view as bigger? The further backhaul opportunity, or with the NGL transport opportunity, would you view that as larger?","Steven J. Kean","I guess, I would say, John, it's bigger if we could do both. And so we're trying to figure out a way to do both. And that is a function of being able to expand our backhaul -- our gas backhaul capacity on TGP, and still leave room for a Y-Grade option. And that's really the path that we're on. Now the thing that we have -- there are a few things that have to come together in order to make that happen. The biggest one of which is that Utica and Marcellus producers have to be ready to commit. And so as you know, we extended the open season, we and MarkWest extended the open season on the Y-Grade line and -- to the end of February, and we are working actively with customers. We think it's a good project. We think it's a good solution. I think MarkWest, I know MarkWest thinks it's a good solution and a necessary outlet for producers up there. But it sometimes takes a while to have that materialize into commitments. But our approach is, we think there's a way to do both, and so that's what we're pursuing right now. But it's not entirely within our hands, it's up to the market in part.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And I mean, can you comment at all on what you think might be -- what's causing the hesitation to commit, or is that something you can't talk about?","Steven J. Kean","Well, no. I mean, I think it's -- look, if you look at the numbers, people are projecting 1 million barrels additional NGL volume coming out of the Marcellus and Utica -- or the Martica, I guess, the combined play. And if that's the case, I mean, you can fill up 2 pipelines, expanded, right? But there's a time lag between projections and -- projections coming true, and people being confident in what they have, and needing an outlet and signing up for an outlet. And so it's really just a function of, I think, a natural producer, with their working -- not so sure it's a hesitation -- they're working first on their production and figuring out how to get it out of the ground and what it is that's coming out of the ground, and then they start looking for the downstream solutions. And that's a question of timing, they're going to need them, we're convinced they're going to need them, we're convinced that an outlet to Mont Belvieu is going to be part of the answer, but they have to be prepared to sign up.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then with the -- moving over to SACROC, with the increased production you're seeing, maybe you'll cover this further at Analyst Day, but as far as you keep pushing out the year when you see production rolling over, is it fair to say that, that's going to pushed out further once again? And is it now going to be pushed out to say, somewhere around 2018 or so, if you could talk a little bit about that?","Unknown Executive","Yes, I think there's a number of things that are obviously impacting the in-fields we're finding from some of the seismic we've run, we're working out very well, we still have a lot of opportunities there. Our platform areas are doing better recovery than we expected, we're doing some horizontals up there that are looking really good, these horizontals will allow us to go back in amidst [ph] some -- pick up some bypass pay. This will extend SACROC out several more years, and we'll get into that in the conference. But I think you'll be surprised how many years out it will extend it. Our harvest wells continue to do well. In fact, we're backing off of those a little bit, just to have -- we started those when we needed CO2. Now we've kind of got, with Doe Canyon coming on, full strength. We've got a little bit more CO2 coming into the basin, so we backed off the harvest a little bit, not doing as many of those as we had planned this year or next year probably, but still, we'll run the 2,900 barrels a day with the harvest wells, so that's a good project there, too.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was just wondering, I had a couple of questions, if you're working at the natural gas pipeline segment, and you took out what happened with the Copano acquisition, just wondering how that baseline business stacked up against the original budget for the year, if you have that available?","Richard D. Kinder","Sure, I think Kim covered that, [indiscernible]","Kimberly Allen Dang","I can take you through it. So natural gas, versus its budget -- or versus the original budget was up about 10%. Without Copano, without any benefit of the Copano acquisition, it would have been down about 3%. And the reason that it would have been down was poor performance out of our trading business, lower storage revenues coming on our Texas intrastates, and then our investment in the Eagle Hawk, our 25% investment and JV with BHP didn't ramp-up as quickly as we expected it to in our budget.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you, great. And then for Kinder Morgan Canada as well, how do things look if you excluded the impact of the Express-Platte sale?","Kimberly Allen Dang","If you exclude -- and Express has an impact on Trans Mountain as well, because we had a management fee that Trans Mountain was getting. And so, if you just look at Trans Mountain, other than the loss of revenue from Express, Trans Mountain would have been on its budget.","Operator","Next question comes from Kevin Kaiser with Hedgeye Risk Management.","Kevin Kaiser","The first question I have here is on the Natural Gas segment. Transport volumes were down 5% year-over-year in the quarter, and gathering volumes down 3.4% year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk about what's driving that?","Steven J. Kean","I think, at least on the gas transport side, I think it was -- and, Tom, you correct me. We had record electric generation volumes associated with relative coal to natural gas pricing. That was probably a contributor, not sure if it was the whole story there.","Thomas A. Bannigan","'12 versus '13.","Steven J. Kean","Yes, in '12 versus '13. I think our sales volumes were actually up, so I think you may be right on transporting, gathering, but the sales volumes were up on our Texas intrastates. And then gathering, probably a function of the KinderHawk or the KinderHawk volumes. And so, both on the transport side, and in that case, if that's the explanation that KinderHawk -- we have minimum commitment, so it's demand based on gas transportation side, and it is take or pay, effectively demand based on the KinderHawk asset as well, contract minimums.","Kevin Kaiser","Okay. Moving to the CO2 segment. What was the EOR side -- in the EOR side of that business, what was capital expenditures in the fourth quarter? Total CapEx for EOR in 4Q '13?","Kimberly Allen Dang","I don't have it with me, hang on a second.","Richard D. Kinder","[indiscernible] EOR versus the rest of CO2.","Kimberly Allen Dang","Go to your next question, and we'll see if we can find it.","Kevin Kaiser","Okay, and KMP, what's the coverage guidance for 2014 DCF versus the guided distribution?","Kimberly Allen Dang","We haven't given it yet, and we're going to go through the entire budget in 2 weeks at the Analyst Conference, or 1.5 weeks, 2 weeks at the Analyst Conference.","Richard D. Kinder","Including the expected coverage.","Kimberly Allen Dang","And the expected coverage on KMP, EPB and KMI.","Kevin Kaiser","Okay. And the last question I have is, have you considered amending KMP's partnership agreement for how sustaining capital was defined there? I mean if you look back at when the partnership agreement was put in place, there wasn't E&P, there wasn't shipping, there wasn't coal royalties, so do you think that amending that partnership agreement would be appropriate to protect the limited partners from dilution?","Richard D. Kinder","I don't think we have any present plans, Kevin, to change the partnership agreement. We think it's worked very well, something that was put into effect in 1992, long before we bought it. And we think it does a good job of protecting the limited partnership.","Kimberly Allen Dang","We think our limited partners have gotten a very nice return over those 12 years. And we expect them to continue to get a nice return in the future. The expansion capital for 2013, for the S&T business was a little over $200 million, and we spent about $675 million total in CO2.","Kevin Kaiser","You're talking about S&T though...","Kimberly Allen Dang","S&T and then the rest would be oil and gas.","James P. Wuerth","[indiscernible] about 4 75.","Steven J. Kean","And I think, Jim, if I'm remembering correctly, if you look at SACROC and Yates together, the total CapEx in there was about $330 million, $340 million. The total DCF on a combined basis was a little over $1 billion.","Operator","And our last question that I am showing comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On EPB, flat distribution this quarter and your guidance is for flat distributions for the rest of '14, can you talk about what visibility you have on being able to maybe increase that distribution beyond '14?","Richard D. Kinder","Again, we're going to take you through all that in 2 weeks at the conference, and that's what we're working on now, looking out as I said, across all the companies, out through '18. But horseshoes and hand grenades, the key thing on EPB is that it's relatively flat, it has very good, solid contracts but has some headwinds relatively flat, that obviously has -- will get a nice bump when the Elba Island assets come online. But we're going to take you through that. Like I said, we're running numbers out through '18 and going to be able to take you through on all 3 companies in 2 weeks.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then on SACROC, that's probably the biggest bump in production that I've seen on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Is that -- I think, you spent 2 -- I just want to clarify, is that largely being driven by horizontal drilling?","Unknown Executive","Yes, I think so, and particularly in the north platform, one of the things we're seeing that is the oil bank was probably pushed more towards the well bores prior to us even injecting, because there had been CO2 injected in that area back probably in the late 90s with Penns [ph] Energy. So CO2 had already been in the ground, and that's the upside on this, as we're seeing that in tight zones, that the longer the CO2 sits in there, it starts making that oil bank. And we drilled some horizontals. We had trouble getting delays and getting permits from the railroad commission for 2 or 3 months and we're producing 400, 500 barrels a day out of those horizontals that we're using now as injectors. So that gives you an idea of the oil bank that was ready there, and that's what gives us a huge opportunity for some of the bypassed oil back in some of the other areas in Bullseye and so forth, where we put lot of CO2 into the middle canyon, and just didn't produce the barrels out that with that we would. It was a geat opportunity to go in with horizontals, and get that back in there.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Can you speak to how many horizontals you drilled during the quarter?","Unknown Executive","I believe we drilled 4 during the quarter.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then, plans for '14?","Unknown Executive","We've -- can't remember all of them. I know we've got a couple of -- that we're going in to test the bypass oil and then I think we've got just our regular development, up in the platform area, I think we've got 4 or 5 of them set to go there.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then last question on the per unit DD&A in the CO2 business. It looks like it was a sizable drop quarter-to-quarter, about $2 a barrel. Anything in particular going on there?","Richard D. Kinder","Drop in the DD&A per unit.","Unknown Executive","I think the key thing there was just the additional barrels that we produced in -- at SACROC, lower rate that we've been able to push in there. We've got a lot more barrels. We -- the infrastructure's now getting to a point where we're not having to add a lot of extra infrastructure to get to additional oil. And so that, over time's just going to push that rate down.","Operator","And I am showing no further questions at this time.","Richard D. Kinder","Okay, well, thanks to all of you. I appreciate you sharing some time with us. Thank you, have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"12582":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to inform all parties that today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.","Richard Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Sheila. And welcome to our first quarter analyst call for both KMI and KML. Before we begin as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call includes forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of KMI's and KML's earnings releases and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","With that out of the way, let me make just a few comments before turning the call over to Steve. First of all, on a very positive note, our board today made some important personnel decisions, which I believe will benefit KMI for years to come.","We promoted four really outstanding people: Kim Dang to President of the company; Dax Sanders to Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer of KMI; David Michaels to Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Anthony Ashley, currently, VP and Treasurer to Treasurer and VP of Investor Relations. I will remain Executive Chairman and Steve will remain CEO. But we're very pleased with those outstanding individuals, and we look forward to many good years of performance.","Now let me talk about - a little bit about our results in a broad sense. As you can see from 2017 full year results and from the results of the first quarter of '18, which Kim will share with you today and from our full year 2018 budget and outlook, KMI continues to generate strong cash flow, and we intend to use that cash in a fiscally responsible manner to benefit our shareholders.","In that regard, when you think about it, there are several potential uses of these funds. We can use them for expansion CapEx or selective acquisition, either of which helps us grow the company. We can use the funds to pay dividends to our shareholders. We can buy in shares or we can pay down our debt.","In my judgment, any and all of these options, create value for our shareholders. And speaking of dividends, consistent with our prior announcements, we are this quarter, raising our dividend payable to our common shareholders by 60% from an annualized rate of $0.50 a share to $0.80 per share.","I'm very pleased in our ability to reward our shareholders by returning this additional cash to them. And I would remind you that we'll continue to fund all of our capital expenditures with internally generated funds and ask Kim will describe, that we have bought back additional shares during the first quarter. Steve?","Steven Kean","Thanks, Rich. I'm going to update you on KMI performance highlights and then turn it over to Kim as usual to take you through the financials. Following that, I will update you on KML and again, turn it back to Kim who's still into Dax Sanders on today's call. So that she can review KML's financial performance with you then we'll take your questions on both KMI and KML.","Starting with KMI. We had a strong quarter at KMI with positive signs for full year performance. KMI as a whole generated DCF per share of $0.56 for the quarter, an increase of about 4% year-over-year. Both natural gas and the CO2 segments were above planned and solidly up year-over-year of 6% to 7%, respectively.","We continue to execute well on our growth projects, we placed $700 million worth of expansions in the service during the quarter. And we continue to find attractive new opportunities and added $900 million worth of projects to the backlog during the quarter. The vast majority of the backlog additions are in our Natural Gas segment.","Turning to the Natural Gas segment. Our transport volumes were up 10% year-over-year in the first quarter and gas gathered and crude gathered volumes were up 1% and 3%, respectively. The 10% increase in the transport volumes is on top of an 8% year-over-year increase that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. So two quarters in a row of strong year-over-year growth.","On the gathering, there was pluses and minuses. We're up in the Haynesville on our gathered gas volumes and on our Hiland assets in the Bakken, we're up on both gas and crude gathered volumes, and those are partially offset by lower gathered volumes in the Eagle Ford.","We also continue to see strong pull and the demand side power was up, 22% year-over-year on our systems. Mexico exports, up 2% and reminder, Kinder Morgan is about - export is about 70% of the gas that is exported to Mexico.","So on the volumes, we had a normal winter overall with extremes early in January that drove all time records on four of our large networks. Cold weather helps remind the market of the value of the holding firm transportation and storage capacity. But there is more going on here in the gas segment than a few cold winter days.","Gas supply and demand is growing across the US. Volumes are growing in the Permian, the Bakken and the Haynesville, driving producer push activity and growing LNG exports are creating demand pull. This elevates of the value of our existing network and creates opportunity for new investment.","A couple of data points to illustrate that. About 90% of our $900 million of backlog additions in the quarter were in the gas segment. A further illustration, we signed up about 1.2 Bcf of Permian capacity on our El Paso natural gas transmission line. This are short haul moves and the expansion capital is required - is very modest, for a little over $30 million and with an EBITDA multiple of less than 2 times.","This illustrates the value of having pipe in the ground, while overall utilization of the network is climbing as a result of a growing supply and demand, including export demand.","We made progress during the quarter signing up the remaining capacity on our 2 Bcf a day Gulf Coast Express project, 94% of the capacity is now spoken for under long-term reservation based contracts. The last 6% is a long-term gas purchase by our Texas and trust state to serve our sales business in the State of Texas. That commitment is pending, and we would expect to conclude it soon. Attention, the basin is now turned underneath for a second pipeline and discussions are in early stages.","In the CO2 segment, we benefited from both higher crude production and higher prices. Our largest field, SACROC has performed above plan in the first quarter and is up 4% year-over-year. We continue to see promising results out of the transition zone, which has been additional target area for us that could add 600 million to 700 million barrels of original oil in place to the SACROC field.","The production at our smaller fields, Katz, Goldsmith and Tall Cotton is up 18% year-over-year with Tall Cotton by itself being up 58% year-over-year. On Tall Cotton, we have grown production there, but mechanical and operational issues have kept the volumes below our expectations for that development.","We're working on that, and we'll be working on it in the coming months, and we will want to be convinced that we have solutions before we commit further capital or commit capital to the Phase III development efforts there.","In our Products segment, we saw refined products volumes increase about 0.5% year-over-year, which in contrast to the fourth quarter, is little less than the 1.9% EIA estimate for the broader industry.","We had strong deliveries in the fourth quarter of last year, particularly in December, particularly in Arizona and that likely had a carryover impact on the first quarter of this year, and meaning inventory's built during December and therefore to press draws or sort of throughput on the pipeline.","We were on plan - we're on plan for the quarter in the segment, earnings before DD&A basis so we're up about 1% year-over-year. We also placed our Utopia pipeline and service in January of this year.","The Terminals segment was down about 2% year-over-year in part attributable to the impact of divestitures as John and the team continue to orient our business board toward up position and have gradually shed non-core positions.","We're making good progress on our Base Line Terminal project in Edmonton where we are on time and on budget, as we bring tanks into service over the course of the year.","There's one other topic I'll cover on KMI, and it's this. We've seen some nice emergence of some good tailwinds in the gas segment, certainly observed those in the first quarter. But we also saw a longer term headwind emerge as FERC has initiated a notice of proposed rule making and other actions designed to flow through the benefit of tax law changes through pipeline rates.","Given the settlements and moratoria that we have in place and including one settlement we have pending before their commission right now, we do not expect to see an incremental negative impact in 2018 or '19 to our outlook.","And as we said in the January call before the FERC [ph] came out, we expect the impact of FERC's action to be mitigated and spread over time. That is still our expectation and here's why. Only about a third of our interstate natural gas pipeline revenue is collected under max rate tariffs. We have negotiated rate arrangements in place to achieve and the commission acknowledges should not be disturbed and we also sell a significant share of our capacity under discounted rate arrangements.","Second, we have rate case moratoria in place in several of our systems, which inhibits the reopening of existing rates. Third, rate cases under Sections 4, and particularly, under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act are prospective in effect, with impacts on the Section 4 case is being no earlier than 30 days or five months following the date of filing and on Section 5 prospecting from a final order.","In recent years, the most - the commission has initiated on the Section 5 front is four in a year. Other years have been zero or one or two. That compares to over 130 regulated entities in the gas sector.","Fourth, an observation. We believe the 501G filings that's we'll all be making will not be as useful as assumed by the commission in terms of determining so called over-earning, separate and apart from the impact of tax law changes.","We believe this for a number of reasons. The 501G is ignore - the instructions ignore important commission principles, including the [indiscernible] recognition of the status of negotiated arrangement before mostly uses [ph] an outdated ROE decision that is applied on a one size fits all basis. We believe the forms will overstate matters and will have limited utility.","We intend to use everything at our disposal to mitigate the negative effects of the actions and the spread their effects over time. We have quantified the impact of the tax rate change in isolation and believe that the incremental impact of that change is about - to our outlook is about $100 million a year if fully implemented, which again, we would expect would be delayed.","It's incremental meeting that's on top of what we already assumed. We had already taken this into account on SNPP [ph] and our outlook and in our settle - pending settlement on SNG, for example.","This does not include other negative impacts from new rate proceedings, which we would \u2013 we believe are too uncertain, both in amount and timing to quantify at this point.","And one final point here, and this is not about ratemaking, but it's about fundamental justice and reasonableness, which is something we will urge the commission to take into account as we consider how to exercise its discretion to pursue Section 5 cases.","We're over 30 years now, the commission has methodically created a competitive market in the interstate Natural Gas Pipelines industry. That policy has been steadily implemented through Republican and Democratic administrations. It has delivered enormous benefits to producers and consumers.","Pipelines are open access, shippers can sell the capacity they hold in competition with the pipeline who provides it and pipelines can build new pipelines in competition with incumbents.","Pipelines are not analogous to traditional regulated utilities. The traditional regulatory compact bounces exclusive franchise service territories, which are insulated from competition on the one hand, with rate regulation on the other hand, that caps rates but enables a reasonable return on capital.","Pipelines do not have protected franchise, most rates are set in the competitive market and many systems under recover a regulated cost of service with no effective opportunity to raise rates given the competitive market environment and the commission policy is created.","It's either just or nor reasonable to ignore the industry's competitive structure and selectively apply the other half of the regulatory compact rate regulation to some systems without enabling other systems that under recover - to recover their cost of service.","We expect to continue pressing these arguments as we expect other people in the industry will as well with the commission as they work through what we expect to be a time consuming implementation process.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to our President, Kim Dang.","Kimberly Dang","Thanks, Steve. Okay, today, we're declaring a dividend of $0.20 per share, as Rick said that the 60% increase over last quarter consistent with our budget, as well as the plan we laid out for everyone last July.","Based on our current stock price, the $0.20 per quarter or $0.80 to annualized results have a very attractive dividend yield of over 5% with significant coverage. As Steve said, we had an outstanding first quarter, well above our budgets and nicely above last year. For the full year, we expect to meet or exceed our DCF and EBITDA budget.","First, today, let me start with the GAAP numbers, and then I'll move to Bcf, which is the way that we look at and judge our performance. Net income attributable to common stockholders for the quarter was $485 million or $0.22 a share, which is an increase of $84 million in total or $0.04 per share, respectively, with both increases being over at 20% increase versus the first quarter of last year.","As you can see from looking at the income tax expense line item on our GAAP income statement, almost all of this increase results from lower income tax expense, primarily due to the reduction in the tax rate associated with the new change - the new tax law.","But if you adjust for certain items, which are for this quarter, the first quarter of 2018, an immaterial $4 million expense, but were a benefit of about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017. The change in income tax expense accounts for a little less than 60% of the change, as opposed to the entire change with the remaining change generated by stronger operating contribution.","Adjusted earnings, which excludes these certain items changes are up $118 million or 29%. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.22 is the same as the unadjusted number because as I mentioned, certain items for the quarter had a minimal impact.","DCF per share, which is the primary way we judge our performance is $56 per share, up $0.02, which is 4% higher versus the first quarter of 2017. Total DCF of almost $1.25 billion is up approximately $32 million or 3%. The nice increase in DCF was driven primarily by greater contributions from natural gas and CO2, partially offset by higher sustaining CapEx, cash taxes and the impact of the KML IPO.","DCF per share was up 4% versus the 3% on total DCF due to $21 million fewer shares outstanding. We repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter of last year and approximately $250 million in the first quarter of this year.","Overall, the segments were up 4% or $78 million with natural gas up 6% contributing $63 million or over 80% of the improvement. Natural gas benefited from nice performance on the Texas Intrastate and SNG driven by winter weather, on Hiland driven by increased drilling activity, on NGPL as a result of lower interest expense, EPNG due to greater capacity sales, primarily driven by the Permian, and on FGT due to lower taxes.","The CO2 segment was up $15 million or 7% driven by a 5% increase in net oil volume, primarily at SACROC and Tall Cotton, as Steve mentioned, as well as increases in oil and NGL prices.","Non-controlling interest is higher by approximately $13 million due to the IPO of our Canadian assets last May. Cash taxes were $16 million higher than the first quarter of 2017, but are actually lower than our budget for the quarter and expected to be significantly lower than our budget for the full year.","Sustaining CapEx was approximately $10 million higher in the first quarter of '18 versus 2017. As you may remember, our 2018 budget for sustaining CapEx was higher than our 2017 actual and I went through that various explanation at our Analyst conference.","For the first quarter, we're actually running a favourable variance to budget but that's going to be timing for the full year. So the segments are up $78 million, less the $26 million combined increase in sustaining CapEx and cash taxes and the $13 million increase in non-controlling interest, that totals a $39 million increase in DCF versus a $32 million increase shown on the page. There are obviously more moving pieces but that gives you a big picture of what's going on.","We're off to a great start this year and as I previously mentioned, we expect DCF for the full year to meet or exceed our budget, driven by better performance from our natural gas and CO2 segment, lower cash taxes offset by higher interest expense due to higher LIBOR rates.","Certain items for the quarter were an expense of $4 million, so as I mentioned immaterial in total. There were however, a few offsetting items. There is a $37 million expense primarily related to an SFPP rate case reserve, which relates to prior periods.","The 2018 impact of this is included in our results for the first quarter and taken into account in our forecast for the full year. There are $40 million expense related to hedge ineffectiveness on our oil hedges primarily related to an increase in the mid [indiscernible] differential and these two expenses were largely offset by two tax benefits items, first, the release of the tax reserve on a sales and use tax, and secondly, the impact of tax reform on a couple of our joint ventures.","Our expansion CapEx budget for the year was 2.2. Our current forecast is $2.3 billion as we've identified some incremental projects to meet our return requirements. Let me once again remind you that the $2.2 billion does not include any KML CapEx.","With that, let me move to the balance sheet. There is one change in the balance sheet that I want to point out. You'll see a new caption between liabilities and shareholders equity entitled Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest, which for GAAP purposes, is considered mezzanine equity.","Due to a change in the accounting rules starting in 2018, an amount related to our Elba JV, which we previously classified as a long-term liability is now reflected as mezzanine equity. This is an item that we disclosed in our financials for those of you who enjoy reading our 10-K and 10-Qs as we enter into the Elba JV, which reflects the fact that in certain limited circumstances, which we do not expect to occur, our JV partner has the right to redeem its capital account.","The outlook project is well underway with the first units expected to be delivered in the third quarter of this year. We ended the quarter at 5.1 times debt-to-EBITDA, flat to last quarter, and as calculation we used net debt, including 50% of the KML preferred shares in the denominator - actually in the numerator, which is consistent with how the rating agencies treat those shares.","Currently, we expect to end the year at or below our budget of 5.1 times debt-to-EBITDA. Net debt ended the quarter at $36.7 billion, that's an increase of $331 million in the quarter, which I will reconcile for you.","Of the $331 million, about $100 million is associated with increased debt in Canada and $231 million is associated with KMI standalone. We had DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, $1.247 billion. We had a little less than $650 million of expansion, capital and contributions to equity investments. Now that's 600 - it's actually about $645 million, includes expenditures at Trans Mountain because it's consolidated. If you exclude the Trans Mountain, the capital spending is a little bit over $510 million.","We had dividends of $277 million. We've made share repurchases of $250 million, and then we have working capital and other items of a little over $400 million. On the working capital and other items, accrued interest was a use of cash of about $195 million as we make interest payments - our significant interest payments were made in the first and third quarters, but the accruals that's in DCF is constant throughout the year.","We also had a use of cash associated with accrued liabilities of about $125 million, and that's because we make bonus payments in the first quarter and also their significant property tax payments made in the first quarter. And then we also had a use of cash associated with our DCF - the DCF being reflected, being slightly greater than the distributions that we received from our equity investments.","And so with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steven Kean","Okay. Now we're going to switch to KML. Last week, we announced that the KML had a decision point on the Trans Mountain expansion project. We announced the suspension of non-essential spending and that under current conditions we would not put additional KML capital at risk.","We also said there's no readthrough from this in terms of our willingness to invest in Canada. We have invested in Canada, British Columbia, as well as Alberta, and we expect to continue investing. But as we said then, it's become clear this particular investment may be untenable [ph] for a private party to undertake.","The events of the last 10 days have confirmed those views. We pointed out there are significant differences between governments, those differences are outside of our ability to resolve. We are continuing our stakeholder discussions between now and May 31 and we're looking for a way forward on this project.","All of that is the same as what we said on the call last week, nothing new there. However, discussions are underway and as the Prime Minister said on Sunday, we're not going to undertake those discussions in public and we do not intend to provide additional updates on the status of those until we reached a sufficiently definitive agreement or the discussions have terminated. So again, not much update, but discussions have commenced.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kim to talk about financial performance at KML during the quarter.","Kimberly Dang","Thanks, Steve. Let me process my comments as Dax has, in prior quarters with the caveat, while we are offering quarter-over-quarter comparison. Those comparisons are of limited value given that we're reporting a quarter where KML was owned by the public versus a quarter where it was wholly owned by KMI.","During those periods, prior to the IPO, there were significant shareholder loans in place that generated FX, most of which is unrealized and intercompany interest with KMI that are not reflective of the true earnings power of KML. Therefore, we would ask you to focus on the actual results to 2018 and how they compare to our published budget. Quarter-over-quarter will be more starting in the third and fourth quarters of this year when we have comparable quarters all post IPO.","Now moving to the results. Today, the KML board declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.1625 [ph] per restricted voting share, or $0.65 annualized, which is consistent with our budget and previous guidance.","Earnings per restricted voting share for the first quarter of 2018 are $0.10, drive - derived from $44 million of net income, which is down approximately $2 million or 5% versus the same quarter in 2017.","In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a foreign exchange gain associated with the intercompany loans. These loans were settled at the time of the IPO and therefore, that gain does not recur in 2018.","Adjusted earnings, which include certain items, the most significant of which is the FX gain I just mentioned, were approximately $44 million compared to approximately $40 million for the same quarter in 2017. This increase is largely associated with a decrease in interest expense given the extinguishment of the intercompany loans and increased AEDC associated with the spending on the Trans Mountain expansion project.","Total DCF for the quarter is approximately $77 million, which is down $6.4 million from the comparable period in 2017 but favourable to our budget. That DCF provides coverage approximately $5.5 million and reflects a DCF payout ratio of approximately 76%.","Looking at the components of the DCF variance, segment EBITDA before certain items is up $6.8 million compared to the Q1 2017 with the pipeline segment up $7.3 million and the terminal segment down very slightly. The pipeline segment was higher primarily due to the AEDC associated with the spending on the project. The terminals segment was lower due to the termination of the contract in Q1 2017 for which we received the net termination benefit, and lower volumes at our Vancouver Wharves terminal. Offset by the Base Line Terminal coming into service.","On the Baseline Terminal project, we placed six of the 12 tanks into service during the quarter. The first four tanks went into service on schedule in January, which we talked to you about on our January investor conference. The next two was rescheduled to be placed in the service the first couple of weeks of June were actually placed in service early in mid-March and the beginning of April.","G&A is higher by about $2.4 million primarily associated with higher cost of being a public company. Lower interest expense and higher preferred share dividends largely offset each other.","Sustaining CapEx was favourable about $3.4 million compared to 2017, but we expect sustaining CapEx to be slightly favourable to the budget for the year. Cash taxes increased by $6.5 million to $6.6 million over the same quarter in 2018. In 2017, we were not required to make estimated cash tax payments but do need to make them in Q1 of 2018.","Now moving on to the specifics for the full year. Currently, we expect at EBITDA DCF, excluding AEDC for the full year to be on plan. AEDC and capitalized interest will be highly dependent upon what happens with the project.","With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. As you can see there, we did draw on the facility during the quarter for approximately $100 million, but we still ended the quarter with a net cash position of $110 million.","If you add 50% of our preferred equity to our net debt balance, which is again, the way the rating agencies generally look at it, our net debt position at March 31 was approximately $165 million. For the quarter, net debt increased by approximately $129 million from December 31.","And so let me reconcile that for you. DCF was $77 million, expansion CapEx was $167 million, gross dividends were $58 million, the DRIP, the dividend reinvestment program, generated proceeds of $15 million, and then working capital and other items were a slight positive.","Finally, just a couple of things on expansion capital. On Base Line Terminal, which now approximately $304 million of our share of the $398 million on the project, so about $94 million less to spend in 2018. On Trans Mountain, we've now spent about $1.1 billion as of the 3\/31, with approximately $550 million of that spend by KMI and periods prior to the IPO and the balance spent by KMI since the consummation of the IPO.","With that, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steven Kean","Okay. Sheila, we're ready to take questions on KMI and KML.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Hi, Jeremy. How are you?","Jeremy Tonet","Good. Good afternoon. Thanks. Just want to see, with regards to the FERC matters, if you had talked to the commissioners there? And do you have any sense if there could be any kind of reconsideration of what they've done here?","It seems like some of the comments, maybe the employee expects some of the actions to happen in the marketplace given what they did during open market hours?","Steven Kean","Yeah. Look, I think even in public testimony statements as recently as yesterday, there was a recognition I think, that a lot of comments are going to have to be reviewed and a lot of input is going to have taken in, in order to make the right decisions here, and so we're encouraged by that.","We\u2019re obviously reaching out as our industry is reaching out in every way that it can to make sure that our views and our facts are known to the commission as they're figuring out how to proceed here.","And it's really - I mean, it's extremely important, I think, for the commission to take into account the results, the benefits, but also the other implication of a long-standing policy of creating competition in competitive markets, intrastate pipeline transmission, they succeeded, they've succeeded in that.","But that is a fundamentally different environment than, say, a traditional regulated utility and that needs to be adequately taken into account as they think about how to use and exercise their discretion. And so we're encouraged by their openness to the input, and we intend to give them plenty of it. I didn't mean that disrespectfully.","Jeremy Tonet","Thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-ups and just want to see, when you were talking about the moratorium, was that the FERC is prohibited from reopening where you have moratorium, am I correct in understanding what you said there? And also just as far as how the supplies of liquids pipeline, I was wondering if you might be able to expand a little bit there on the refined products side?","Steven Kean","Yes, so the settlements really are applying to the gas pipeline side of the house, wherein ongoing rate case on SMPP has been going on for a very long time. And on the gas taking - talking specifically about gas, settlements don't bind subsequent commissions, but they are generally honored and there's good language in FERC orders about settlements and rate moratoriums or moratoria, that are in place where they tend to respect them.","The parties sit around and negotiate an outcome and they do so in good faith. The commission, along with the customers and the pipeline and typically those settlements are - typically, those settlements will bind the private parties, if you will, to their terms, but can't legally bind the commission. But again, the practice has been for the commission to honor those.","Jeremy Tonet","Great. Thanks. And then just one last one, if I could. With regards to the Permian Pipeline, the second one that you're talking about there, that's interesting to hear. Just wondering if you could talk about the competitive dynamic as far as pursuing this project, if you look to bring that to the same market or different path.","And just how you think, I guess, Waha basis moves over time here in the effective benefit you know, KMI in the interim, as it seems like even GCX isn't going to be online for a while here in the basis is really kind of an upside, I don't know if there's other smaller brownfield things that you can do in the interim to take advantage of that?","Richard Kinder","Well, look you put your finger right on the fundamentals, but I don't want you to leave the call being all too interested in what we said there. This is a very early kind of discussions. But I think it is the view in that market, that a second pipe really is needed.","And I think it's clear that certain producers with significant production coming online have been holding, if you will, holding commitments back in order to help underwrite a second pipeline. And so it does look likely that something will be built.","We have the same advantages that we talked about when we talked about Gulf Coast Express, which is there's some and with the right make-up partners, there's good upstream connectivity, and we have great downstream connectivity to get that gas to the markets that are really booming right now, which is along the Texas Gulf Coast, both for Mexico exports, as well as power and pet-chem demands and LNG.","And so we think we've got - that we have some advantages in that, but it's in the very early stages, so don't get too interested just yet, I would say. But I think you're right, the fundamentals are strong and I think they support a second pipeline getting billed. The gas is growing rapidly in the Permian, and it is a low cost, if not a negative cost to produce or sure [ph] primarily aiming at NGLs and crude out there.","And so finding a way to deal with a gas or not to have flare is a very important and people, I think are beginning to - shippers are beginning to - are rapidly catching up to that and thinking about ways to relieve those constraints.","In the meantime, the smaller bottleneck, debottlenecking that's kind of what we're doing on the EPNG investments that I mentioned, we're looking at some things on NGPL as well, and we will continue to look for those as well take away from EPNG as these markets \u2013 as these suppliers are hunting markets.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s all, very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","The next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Hi, Shneur.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations to everyone on the promotion. Just a quick follow-up to Jeremy's question there. Could GCX be brought into service you know, given all the demand that everyone is talking about?","Richard Kinder","No, I think, I mean, we\u2019re certainly trying to do everything we can to get it online as soon as possible. But I think our fourth quarter of '19 to the Gulf Coast is really most realistic timeline.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, great. Just a couple of questions. First, starting at a high level, I think we've all beaten the FERC to death at this point. I was just wondering if you can talk about returns on capital deployment as you sort of think about your business over the last couple of years and kind of you've upped your CapEx a little bit, and you're looking at another project.","When one looks at capital returns, are you achieving the returns that you've kind of outlined in the past? Has the erosion in commodity prices at CO2 kind of masked some of those returns? I was wondering if you can sort of talk about that a little bit?","Steven Kean","Yes, good question. We have done well on our project execution and Kim actually went through that, and you'll see it look back from 2015 through 2017 on capital projects and how they came out as a multiple of the year two EBITDA, meaning once the project is fully up and running. And we've done very well, and we've done similar backward looks at our gathering and processing investments, et cetera. The new investments that we talked about this quarter at about 6 time rate. And so I think we're doing quite well there.","And you're right, there's been some deterioration. If you look over that whole period, 2015 to 2017, there's been deterioration in the underlying CO2 business because of lower commodity prices primarily. There have also been some contract rollouts. There is also been some JVs and assets divestitures that we've undertaken in order to improve the balance sheet.","So we've retired over $5.8 billion of debt since late in 2015, and we've improved our multiple from 5.6 to 5.1 time. So we are, as Rich said, we're using our cash, deploying it effectively on projects, and we're using our cash to de-lever, as well as return value to shareholders and I think we've done that effectively over the last two to three years.","Shneur Gershuni","And kind of two quick follow-ups. One, you were just talking about the return of capital and so forth. You've bought back some shares during the quarter. At the same time, you've upped your CapEx estimate for this year.","How should we think about your discretionary cash flow that you outlined, I believe it was about $565 million at the Analyst Day in terms of its ability to continue buying back stock. And I guess, compare with the fact that you're suggesting that you can beat your guidance or projected plans for this year?","Steven Kean","Well, if you look at the situation, of course, we're very clear that we have that number that we showed you, that $550 plus million of free cash flow after funding all of our capital expenditures for the year and obviously, after paying the dividend.","Since that time, we have bought back $250 million worth of stock, and so you could deduct that. And then as the capital moves around, the total expansion CapEx, which as Kim said, now rose to 2.3 instead of 2.2, you would also deduct that.","Our projections which show we will still, after everything we've done, all the capital we have in the plan and all the stock buybacks we've done thus far, we are still nicely positive in terms of actual cash generated after we pay for all these things internally.","Unidentified Company Representative","And so in terms of how to use that cash is the same things we talked about at the beginning of the year and Rich talked about earlier in the call, which is we'll look at what's of the best use, whether it's an incremental project or the return of additional value to shareholders through a share buyback or further delevering, and it's nice to be in this position.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And one final question. During, I think, it was the last quarter or two quarters ago, there was a lot of talk about Double H and the potential for NGL repurposing. But at the same time, the production level for accrued in the Bakken has continued to grow and other takeaway pipelines have been filling towards capacity.","Do you see a trend of improving crude production and heading towards Double H and therefore there's no real need to really think about an NGL repurposing or is that still on the table?","Steven Kean","Yes, we don't have put together an NGL repurposing project, but the second part of what you said is also true, which is production is rising in the Bakken. And so some of our discussions around that pipeline have turned toward how do we get more of that production into Double H, and we've been able to successfully buy and attract some volumes, including truck volumes over to Double H, and so that's been a positive","There's still a bit of capacity overhearing to work through in the Bakken, but the production there has been very promising from a gas NGL and oil standpoint. So prospects, I'd say, are improving there.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon.","Danilo Juvane","Good afternoon. Congrats to everyone who received the promotions today. My first question is on the buybacks. You've done $500 million thus far, you have $1.5 billion still left. Are you done for this year? Or should we expect you to continue to buying back more shares this year?","Kimberly Dang","I mean, as we just went through the free cash flow, we have a little bit of free cash flow still remaining. I think at this point, we're going to look and probably wait a little bit to see what the capital projects look like and see if there's any more of those. But depending on what happens with CapEx, there may be the opportunity to buyback more shares and or pay down debt.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for that. And given where the stock is sort of trading right now, have you thought that all evolved or may be deploying that elsewhere perhaps just paying down debt, instead of buying back shares?","Richard Kinder","Well, I think we will look at that on an opportunistic basis. I think the important thing here, and I hate to keep beating the same drum, but we're in a unique and very positive situation in funding all of our expansion CapEx with internally generated funds, paying the dividend and still having sizable excess cash to use, and we're going to consider that very carefully. And as I said in my opening remarks, we want to be fiscally responsible in how we handle that capital.","So we will look at it, just amplifying what Kim said, we would look at it on an ongoing basis to figure out what makes those most sense. And look, we've improved - since we scatter out, as we\u2019ve improved our balance sheet considerably. As Steve said, we've paid down well over $5 billion worth of debt.","We are now, as Kim says, we targeted 5.1 as debt to EBITDA ratio at the end of 2018. We will meet or beat that, we think, and so we're moving in the right directions, but we would like to get it lower obviously. And so that's a weighing process between delevering and buying back shares.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for the color Rich. Moving on to the backlog. I noticed in the release that you're now deploying organic growth ex Trans Mountain at 6 times. I know that previously, you said that, that number was 7.5 times and 6.7 I think, is this improvement that you've made a function of you just being able to deploy capital more efficiently, can we get some color into that dynamic?","Steven Kean","We look at every project individually, and so we want to get the highest return we can get that the market will pay. And the - and so we will look at, we'll look at the underlying risk on the project and will demand a higher return or we'll get as much as the market will bear.","We have, I think, the numbers you were talking about is more like 6.5 and 6.7 times. It's kind of toggled around that. I wouldn't read anything different into the fact that this slate - particular slate of projects that we're talking about is at 6 times.","We're applying the same criteria we've been applying for several years now, which a couple of years now, which is elevated return criteria well above any reasonable calculated cost of capital and we'll try to get absolutely as much as we can from the market. And so long as we are clearing by a substantial margin our cost of capital, we'll deploy that capital if it's the best use of that cash.","We've targeted at 15% unlevered after-tax return, but we don't reject anything we come in and discuss it, right? Some things are better than the 15% unlevered after-tax return have too much risk associated with them, and they don't make the cut. Some things that are below 15% but have derisks with long-term reservation-based contracts, we relax that 15% and we just continued - we have continued on that path.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for that. Last one for me. What was the CO2 CapEx number\u2026","Kimberly Dang","$91 million.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Hi, Jean.","Jean Salisbury","Hi, good afternoon. I had a few questions about the Permian. So one more on gas. On your existing gas pipeline out of the Permian, is there any room at all for expansion through compression or is this it?","Richard Kinder","Yes, I mean, certainly some of the projects that we're doing on EPNG are those types of projects, very minor CapEx, squeezing out additional capacity from our existing network intrastate, I think were largely fairly filled out and that has a lot to do with why we're involved in GCX.","So I would say those are really the two main areas. We've also balanced some opportunities off NGPL and some of that has been executed on, and we are pursuing a bit more as well. So I think all of those are very low cost, high-return opportunities, and we're pursuing every bit that we can.","Steven Kean","And then we've seen - and it's been in small chunks so far. But people looking for any outlet out of the Permian, including our Trans Colorado system, even giant [indiscernible] have seen some of the effects from the growth in the Permian basin. So that's not expansions, that's existing capacity. So filling up kind of all the nooks and crannies [ph] coming out of the Permian to get to a different market.","Jean Salisbury","Okay. And can you put any numbers at all, I guess, in terms Bcfd on how much more you can actually get out on El Paso and NGVLs? Or it\u2019s too early to say?","Steven Kean","Yes, that's hard to say. It's kind of - as you can tell from the map, it's kind of a network out there. So it depends just on what installations you could put where, whether it's back pressure regulators, which are very cheap or compression, which is more expensive and other connections or things like that. It's a network.","Jean Salisbury","Sure. And then I believe you and [indiscernible] operate or maybe used to operate a rail terminal in the Permian? Can you confirm if you still have that and what's the crude by rail loading capacity available is if you do?","Steven Kean","Ask any longer and I think generally speaking in the Permian, there's not significant current crude by rail unit train capacity. So there's manifest capability, but a manifest cargo capability but not unit train capability, is that right? Okay.","Jean Salisbury","And then one last one. I think you touched on this when you discussed the hedges. But you hedged your EOR production with WTI, but do you have crude transport out of the Permian? Or do you mostly receive a Midland price for your barrels and are kind of exposed to that spread?","Steven Kean","We do have transport out of the Permian, including with our wind [ph] pipeline assets, which takes a significant amount of our production to Western Refining in El Paso. But we also, as part of our hedging program, we hedge quality and locational differentials. So we've hedged for 2018, we're at about 68%, I think, of mid-cush [ph] hedged?","Kimberly Dang","71.","Steven Kean","71% of mid-cush hedged and we're continuing to add to that position as we go through 2018.","Jean Salisbury","That\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Hi, Darren. How are you doing?","Darren Horowitz","Hi, Rich. Good afternoon. And congrats to everybody on the promotions. Steve, my first question is on CO2. Do you guys have a rough estimate of the cost or attune profile per barrel in order to monetize this incremental transition zone barrels versus in smaller fields? Because I know you talked and you guys had put out some slides on the after-tax internal rate of return, but on a risk-adjusted basis, I'm just wondering how to think about return on investment going forward with how you allocate those additional dollars?","Steven Kean","I'll start, and Jesse will finish. So the - one of the great things about the transition zone development is that we can - it is sitting below the area that we are already developing with CO2. So that when we develop a project, we go hit the traditional CO2 flood zone and exploit that, but with a little bit of deepening and sometimes we can even use existing wellheads, wellbores, for that deepening. We can access transition zone barrels.","And so what happens Darren is we get both. We get - we get it from our traditional harvest area, as well as we pick out incremental barrels from the transition zone in those places where we found that. And so far, we found it in a number of places.","And so I think roughly speaking, it's like 28%, 72%, 72%, 70-30 call it of traditional CO2 flood recovery with another 30% transition zone coming from that deepening. Is that about right, Jesse?","Jesse Arenivas","That's right.","Steven Kean","That makes it capital-efficient, that's the bottom line.","Darren Horowitz","And how much of that, if any, is built on the $1.6 billion growth backlog forecasts from 2018 out to 2022? Because I know that you guys have already experimented on what five transition zone wells in the budget this year is two, is that correct?","Richard Kinder","That in terms of development.","Jesse Arenivas","There is very little of that is associated with the backlog. So this is very early, and we're still delineating the field so there's - it's a very little of that $1.7 billion.","Steven Kean","And coming out in CO2, in particular, and also gathering of processing, that capital moves around to chase the best opportunities.","Darren Horowitz","So, Steve, as this evolves theoretically more focused on the transition zone going forward, based on those rate of returns that you guys have discussed, how do you expect the aggregate segment return on investment to evolve over the forecast period within which you're going to spend that $1.6 billion?","Steven Kean","You're beyond any update that we try to do, Darren, we're not there yet.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. If I could just one final question for me on Elba. What's the expected timing of the liquefaction capacity between initial and service in the third quarter of this year and when you guys reached 10 liquefaction units by the middle of 2019? And also how do we think about the timing of the remaining capital spend over those four quarters?","Steven Kean","You want to speak?","Thomas Martin","So, yes. I mean, you have the timeline correct. The first unit will be online in the third quarter and it's approximately 30 to 45 days sequentially from that point. So that gets us kind of end of the late second quarter or late third quarter of 2019.","Steven Kean","And as you probably recall, the return on that or the economics on the liquefaction development are heavily weighted to Unit 1. And so Unit 1, we expect will be coming on and followed within roughly the sequence time laid out by Units 2 and 3 starting in the third quarter. We'll not get into the third quarter, but Unit 1 is expected to get in, in the third quarter.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Keith.","Keith Stanley","Hi, good afternoon. Just wanted to clarify on the growth backlog. The $900 million addition in Q1, that does not include Gulf Coast Express that was already in the backlog, is that correct?","Steven Kean","You are correct. We put that in, in the fourth quarter update that we shared in January. But that's just on top of that.","Keith Stanley","Can you just give color on may be one or two of the largest addition to the backlog in terms of the projects and the timing of them coming into service? I think some of the other opportunities you've mentioned around the Permian are a little smaller in terms of capital?","Steven Kean","Right. Tom, do you have a rough\u2026","Thomas Martin","CNP [ph] gets about $500 million, and then the interstate projects across, I guess, really three different regions, so another 300.","Keith Stanley","Okay\u2026","Thomas Martin","Again, of the 900, 820 is natural gas. So that's overwhelming in the Natural Gas segment.","Keith Stanley","Got it. Okay. One, just on Trans Mountain. One of the principles you laid out pretty clearly is the need for certainty to construct across British Columbia. When you think about some of the discussions on potential financial arrangements with the federal government, can that help address that criteria that one criteria or do you also need some type of specific action or change separate from financial support to give you more confidence you can build across BC?","Steven Kean","Yes, there are really two separate things. I mean, there needs to be a way, most of the project and most of the investment is in British Columbia where the government is in opposition to the project and has look for and found ways to incrementally regulate it. And that is an issue that, in our view needs to be resolved or addressed in order to be able to successfully construct in the province. And so we think of this two separate or related things.","Keith Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Dennis.","Dennis Coleman","Good afternoon to you Rich. Thanks. And my congrats to everyone there on the promotions. A couple for me please. Steve, I wonder if the - back to the FERC issue, I guess, one comment I want to just dig a little bit into. You talked about is this being a time consuming process sort of at the end of your statement there.","And my recollection is the commission, when they were making these decisions, sort of were thinking that these would be a fairly quick process. I want to say they talked about it being done by as early as the fall of 2018.","I wonder, maybe if you can just talk about the differences or compare those two views and maybe give some scale of how you think about the timing and how long this will take?","Steven Kean","Right, so the FERC has laid out a specific schedule in three or four tranches of filing of these 501G forms, right, and so that's pretty well defined. But that's just the beginning. There's a lot more and for reasons I said earlier, I mean, these forms, I think, are going to be less informative, particularly on the issue of over earning and people are expecting because there are some assumptions built into those instructions that we believe conflict with frankly, what we think a commission is ultimately likely to do.","So there is a process of information gathering that's on a very firm timeframe. There is still the whole note for itself, which is a proposed rule and a separate but related notice of inquiry, which is an earlier step even in the process that has to be worked out, and that's the process within which we'll be filing comments and making our case known and seeking some modifications to the rule, the proposed rule.","And then there are there processes themselves, rate proceedings themselves, and those are expensive, they're time consuming, and that's why we have some confidence around the idea that this is going to ultimately play itself out over time.","Dennis Coleman","Okay, so the idea of a 130 pipelines all getting done by the fall is not realistic? In terms of the 501G filing themselves, they have to be filed, and I thought it was a 30 day process. Is that seems like you're indicating that there's some variance there?","Steven Kean","No, there's a phased-in and they've listed specific entities and what wave they're in so there are specific dates for filing a 501G for each individual regulated system.","Dennis Coleman","Okay\u2026","Steven Kean","Four separate ways.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. Thanks for that. One quick question on the leverage number. You say, Kim, that you'll be 5.1 times or potentially below and I just - I want to just clarify that a little bit if I can in terms that's on the existing budget, that doesn't include any assumptions about Trans Mountain going forward or not? I think when you may be announced a couple of weeks ago if there was some indication that it would be 2 times lower if that doesn't proceed?","Kimberly Dang","Right. So what we've assumed in the 5.1 times or better is a similar but updated assumption that we had in our budget, which is we spend it at a reduced rate through May, and then the spending would ramp up.","If Trans Mountain were terminated then we think longer term, not this year, but longer term, because you have incremental spending and would have incremental spending in future years if you pursue the project longer term, there will be a 20 basis point reduction versus what we would have thought if the project went forward in 2019.","Dennis Coleman","Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. Just one last one for me. In the KML release, there was some discussion about lower rail loadings in the quarter from Canada. I wonder if you just might talk a little bit about that with the wide bps [ph] that surprised me a little bit.","Steven Kean","Its rail service related. The service has been - vary a bit more in that area and the Imperial has been negotiating directly with the CN and the CP for improvements in that. And we have seen an uptick as the quarter progress, but it was down significantly throughout the quarter. We hope that, that will improve as we go forward here.","Richard Kinder","It's not because the barrels don't want to move.","Dennis Coleman","Right. That's what surprised me. Anyway, that's weather-related or any particular reason or just poor service?","Steven Kean","It was all poor service related. And remember, that facility was all 100% take or pay related, so it didn't have as big a financial impact, but we would like to see the barrels delivered.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Catellier with CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Robert.","Robert Catellier","Good afternoon, everyone. Hi. I just wanted to ask a couple of questions that came out, first of all, on Trans Mountain. While I respect the fact that you're not negotiating publicly, but I want to inquire about the possibility that any financial agreements with either Alberta or the federal government might result in shareholder dilution or any less exposure to the Trans Mountain project upside or is this primarily a risk mitigation discussion similar to a surety bond on where shareholder upside might remain intact?","Richard Kinder","Yes, Robert. Look, I appreciate the interesting additional color. We're interested too. But there's really nothing more to add there. We have outlined two principles, and I'm just going to restate there has to be a way to build through BC and there has to be a way to protect our shareholders and we are in discussions, and those are the principles that we would be looking to preserve.","Robert Catellier","Okay. So you haven't taken anything off the table, I gather then, any possibility?","Richard Kinder","We didn't say that. We just said we're in negotiations.","Robert Catellier","Okay. Since then you've answered most of my operating question, so I'll just ask one on the promotions. Congratulations to Dax and everyone else. I'm just curious, Dax, obviously will continue his KML responsibilities, but as far as I can tell, your press release - about David Michaels. So I'm wondering if he's going to continue his KML responsibility as well.","Dax Sanders","Right now, the IR responsibilities for KML were under me, now they'll be transitioned to Anthony Ashley, who's our Treasurer currently, and is today promoted from Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.","Robert Catellier","Okay. And then just finally. Are these changes the timing is it just coincidental with the news on Trans Mountain, or is there any readthrough there?","Steven Kean","No, no, there's no readthrough. There's no readthrough if at all. And Robert, I want to confirm you're correct, Dax will continue as Chief Financial Officer of KML.","Robert Catellier","Okay. Congratulations. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Robert, how are you doing?","Robert Kwan","Good. How are you doing?","Richard Kinder","Good.","Robert Kwan","Just wanted to ask on the Canadian M&A potential, and I'm wondering, first, do you need resolution on Trans Mountain before you really look in earnest on the M&A front? And then when you decide to get at it, can you just talk about the different type of assets you might pursue. Would they have to be similar to what KML has right now, would they have to be similar to what KMI has or could you potentially get into a new platform for kind of the entire enterprise?","Steven Kean","Robert, on the first part of that, we are in a period of considerable uncertainty, obviously, depending on how this comes out of the overall project. Now we've defined that, we've closely defined that period in part because it creates a lot of uncertainty for our investors. We've closely defined it, and we've said what we're looking for but there's no question, it's uncertain. And therefore, makes it difficult for -- to evaluate M&A activity.","Once we get a point in clarity, the kind of assets that we've always expressed interest in KML, that is Western Canadian midstream assets. It's still be what we would be looking at and looking for. It's a - it's not a large group of players there, but there are some very capable players with good midstream assets.","And as you know, we have a limited debt on this entity, and so it is something that we want to look at. But I just think realistically, you've got to let things settle out on the process that we're undergoing right now first.","Robert Kwan","Understood. I guess, Steve, you started - you started - you were talking about players versus specific assets. So I guess I'm also wondering, if I can recall within the agreement between KMI and KML, KMI actually had the right to pursue corporate or publicly traded opportunities.","So can you talk about whether that was more theoretical and that the intention absolutely is for publicly traded entities and based on Western Canada to be within KML? Or how should we think about that?","Steven Kean","KML is the entity through which we would be investing in Western Canadian midstream assets of the type that we already have, already own and know how to operate, which you would include other things that KMI owns and operates, similar types of assets and operations. So we've been very broad about that, but if the intent is and was that the KML would be the vehicle to invest in those opportunities in Western Canada.","Robert Kwan","Got it. And if I could just finish with the terminal side, Q1 was a little bit weaker. You talked about the rail movements, which sounds like from others that\u2019s improved. I'm just wondering with holding, are you still holding the 2018 terminals guidance despite the shortfall in Q1? And how do you think you kind of pickup of the rest and - head to the rest of the year?","Steven Kean","Yes, I think you're asking specifically about terminals on KML? I think where our expectation is will come in, in line with...","Dax Sanders","The big decrease was at [indiscernible] which is down $3.5 million, and it was broken down by sulfur, which was one less asset, we think that will catch-up at force majeure on copper. We think that will catch up. The only one that may not catch up is the ag [ph] volume and that's going to depend on the revenues.","Robert Kwan","Okay. But is that catch up to run rate and exceeded to make up for Q1? Is that where you should...","Steven Kean","In the budget.","Kimberly Dang","Right.","Robert Kwan","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Zarahn with Mizuho. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Brian.","Brian Zarahn","Hi, Rich. I guess circling back on your 2018 outlook to kind of beat - to meet or beat your guidance of $2.05 per share in DCF. Just to review your expectation as the gas and CO2 segments to outperform tax they should be lower which more than offset higher interest expense. Is that the right way to summarize your outlook?","Kimberly Dang","Yes, if we beat them, yes, those items would more than offset the interest expense.","Brian Zarahn","Okay. And then your guidance on a per-share basis, how much of the potential upside is from the buyback?","Kimberly Dang","We have the buyback factored into the budget.","Brian Zarahn","Okay. And then on interest expense, just remind us on a floating rate exposure and updates on the impact with LIBOR being above your budget?","Kimberly Dang","Right. So our - the forecast that I just gave you, our guidance for the year, meet or beat our EBITDA and DCF, factors in the LIBOR curve as of the end of last week. So that is a - that's got a current LIBOR curve in there.","Our exposure with respect to floating rates is about 30% of our debt is floating, and so it's about $100 million of exposure for a full year impact of 100 basis points. So we would have to have the 100 basis point increase starting January 1 increasing and going throughout the full year to get to the $100 million.","Brian Zarahn","And then shifting back to Trans Mountain, understanding that you're in negotiations on the expansion. On the scenario hopefully likely that the existing pipeline volumes are curtailed by a government, how should we think about the impacts of that potential outcome and any mitigants that KML has?","Steven Kean","Are you talking about the proposed Alberta legislation?","Brian Zarahn","Correct.","Steven Kean","Yes. Look, there's a lot of back and forth going on and it's in a political realm, and it's not something that I feel particularly qualified to gauge for you. I think that what Alberta is saying, and I'm not even going to try to interpret it. I think there's going to be some back and forth here and this is part of why we're seeking clarity, okay?","Brian Zarahn","Appreciate that. And then my last question is going back to the FERC, shifting to the liquids pipeline side. It's not for about 3 years from now, but looking at the new escalator taking that fact in July of 2021, any initial thoughts on the potential exposure to a lower indexation?","Steven Kean","All that we've seen is probably what you've seen, Brian, which is to that the commission deferred action on the tax issues or pipelines that are under indexed rates to that later date when they're going to be evaluating index overall. And that's really all we know at this point as well.","Brian Zarahn","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Ted.","Ted Durbin","Hey. How is it going? Just one question from me. If we sort of look at the FERC again and assume that the process that they laid out sticks with this 501G form, I guess can you help us out, and realizing you in the process of fighting on your Forms 2 working through them, but if you just take the headline number on some of your larger pipelines or you don't have a more [indiscernible] EPNG, what sort of ROE are you going to be showing when you file your 2017 numbers?","Steven Kean","Look, we do have moratorium in Tennessee. EPNG subject to a rate case that's been going on for quite some time. It was fundamental underlying rate issues that still have not been resolved, which, again, I think points to, Ted, the point that we're making which is there's an awful lot of sort through before you can see the final and full impact implemented from what FERC is doing, looking at the tax flow through, but also taking the rest of the cost of service into account.","So it makes it hard to do quickly, I think that's the main point. And there'll be a lot of moving parts on those discussions and a lot of arguments brought to bear on it. We don't have a number to quote you in terms of what returns you're going to show on for Form 2s, but we're working on the Form 2 filings and we'll make them in a timely fashion.","Ted Durbin","Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Rebecca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is open.","Richard Kinder","Good afternoon, Rebecca.","Rebecca Followill","Good afternoon. Back on 501Gs. We've taken a look out and agreed that they're not really indicative of reality given that they don't take into account negotiated rates. Any thoughts on commenting on the [indiscernible] and trying to get some changes on that form or do you think that's set in stone?","Steven Kean","I haven't seen - we're still - what filing is due on the 25th right. I haven't seen our comments, but we'll be covering a lot of ground in there, I think, I can assure you. But the main thing that we'll be making the point that you just made back over, if they don't make these forms conform to reality, they're going to be a limited usefulness.","And even then, I mean, it's hard to know how you can apply things like a one size fits all ROE on a - from a 2010 litigated rate case and just apply that to everybody. That's not the way things work when you're setting a cost of equity for a system. So I think the 501Gs are going to create more thought [ph] than like.","Rebecca Followill","We'd agree. And then second, you may have already have commented, but on Gulf Coast Express, any comments on potentially twinning that system? And if you were to twin, the timing to - if you were to double it, could you accelerate that and do some of that along as you construct the first phase?","Steven Kean","I don't think you'd look for much of synergy and construction there. Those are limited even when you set out to do it that way. It can be - there's some savings, but it's not as much as you would think. The other real consideration there is this gas may want to hit a different part of the Texas Coast, and so that would take it out of that corridor.","Rebecca Followill","Thank you.","Operator","We are showing no further questions at this time.","Richard Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you very much for joining us this afternoon. Have a good evening.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"12453":["Kinder Morgan Incorporated (NYSE:KMI) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2016  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Rich Kinder - Executive Chairman","Steve Kean - President & CEO","Kim Dang - VP & CFO","Tom Martin - President, Natural Gas Pipelines","Analysts","Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank","Shneur Gershuni - UBS","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the meeting over to our host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay, thank you, Laura, and welcome to our call. As always before we begin, I'd like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","Now let me begin by just making a very few introductory comments before turning the call over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang. First of all, the operating results for both the second quarter and year-to-date are very consistent with Kim's guidance, which she shared with you on our Q1 call and which were in our Q1 earnings release. And I think this demonstrates once more that our assets are consistent generators of strong cash flow, even in these times of volatility.","Several specific events have happened since our last call, mostly positive. First of all, the National Energy Board of Canada recommended approval of our Trans Mountain Expansion Project. This is an important step, but we still need an order in council and that decision is expected in December of this year. We also entered into joint ventures, as you know Southern Company on our SNG natural gas system and with Riverstone on our Utopia pipeline project, and have also divested an additional approximate of 175 million of non-core assets. These steps allow us to significantly improve our balance sheet with the expectation of now ending this year 2016, at about 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is an improvement from the 5.5 times budgeted.","In addition, we\u2019re also reducing our future need for expansion CapEx, and all of this is getting us measurably closer to being able to return significant additional cash to our shareholders through either increasing the dividend or buying back shares. I can assure you we will continue on this right path, as we work to maintain and strengthen our balance sheet, while at the same time preparing to deliver increased value to our shareholders.","And with that I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, thanks. I\u2019m going to update on capital and counterparty credit and then hit on some additional segment highlights and returns that we're seeing. On the capital update, we've been talking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog and how we do that, that consists of make me sure that we're attending to our balance sheet, but also ensuring that we grow our DCF per share through investments that we're making at attractive returns and that we\u2019re now funding out of the excess cash flow that we generate, without leaving to access the capital market.","The high grading includes select joint ventures on assets and projects the Utopia JV shows that we can originate high value mid-stream projects that are valued by investors. On SNG, we're entering a JV with our largest customer in a transaction which brings value to that asset, through specifically identified opportunities and is accretive in the medium-term. We've trimmed some projects from the backlog where they don't make sense from a return standpoint or in today's commodity price environment.","Now, we've also made scope and cost savings improvements and in some cases deferred costs on projects that we're proceeding with. One example of this improvement is, in the gas group in this quarter and part of the reduction in the backlog is due to this. We renegotiated a contract with a customer, as a result of that renegotiation was a reduction in our capital spend for that project a boosted return, acceleration of the end service data of a portion of the revenues. And we freed up some capacity that we believe we can resell. Meanwhile, the customer got the benefit of a lower cost longer term deferred payment.","We're going to continue to work on additional opportunities within our backlog and in addition to our current projects. The result of these efforts is a backlog which now has an EBITDA multiple of 6.5 times, CapEx, that's excluding CO2 projects which tend to have higher returns, but are more commodity price sensitive. We now expect to spend discretionary capital of 2.8 billion in 2016, which is down from 2.9 billion last quarter that we estimated for the year, and down 500 million from as planned for the year. Our backlog is now 13.5 billion, down from 14.1 and that's a function of projects going into service, the Utopia JV, the project renegotiation that I mentioned, and that is against some project revision. So in short, we are making good progress. We're doing what we told you we would do. And that progress is on the balance sheet, as well as positioning us to grow our DCF per share.","On customer credit, we continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations. In the past quarter, credit defaults amounted to about 0.3% of budgeted revenue annualized, and most of that is associated with the Peabody bankruptcy that took place in the first two weeks of the quarter. Without that we would be well under 0.1%. And again, putting our situation in perspective, we're a broadly diversified mid-stream company. We\u2019ve got a strong and diversified customer base, which includes integrated energy majors, utilities and end-users. So the credit picture is stabilizing.","Now for some of the segment highlights and trends, overall when I compare it to a year-over-year basis the segment earnings before DD&A and certain items was down 31 million or 2% from Q2 of 2015 to Q2 of \u201916. CO2 so 31 million, CO2 by itself is down 59 million, due to lower prices primarily, and lower production. Even though CO2 is making plans due to some price improvements and good performance on the cost saving as well. Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 1%, while terminals and products up 4% and 8% respectively, so broad themes on our year-over-year performance.","Number one, we continue to see strong demand for natural gas across our network. Transport volumes are up 5% year-over-year, we're getting good terms on storage, transportation and sales renewals in our business. Power burn on our pipes is up 8% year-over-year and recall the power burn was up 16% from Q2 of \u201914 to \u201915, so there is strong compounding work coming from the power sector. For the first time ever gas is making up a larger share of the fuel for power generation and coal, that's been true year-to-date for 2016, and if I close in 2015 in the last -- most recent quarter is through \u201916, 35% of generation came from gas, versus 27% from coal.","Gas exports are up on our respected fields. Exports to Mexico have grown to 3.3 Bcf a day, and three quarters of that volume moved on Kinder Morgan sites. We continue to believe and we're seeing that the need for natural gas transportation and storage service is growing as the demand in the power generation sector and industrial sectors continues to grow, along with export demand from Mexico in LNG. The products pipelines were getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes on KMCC and Quotient and the start-up in the second splitter units in Houston Ship Channel.","In terminals, we're seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online as number of liquids makes up a little better than three quarters of our segments earnings before DD&A in this business. And we're also seeing increased utilization in on-site, so more capacity online and higher overall utilization of that capacity.","The second quarter was a record setting quarter for throughput on our liquids terminals. On the bulk side, while coal volumes are down year-over-year other coal volumes are partially offsetting that decline, particularly in Petcos and Metals. We also renewed our Steel handing arrangement with Deepwater for 10 years with some value enhancements in that new deal. Overall, the bulk part of the business is higher year-over-year change to be explained by the coal banks. The negative affecting the business on a year-over-year are of course lower commodity prices, which affect us directly and the enhance oil recovery part of CO2 and indirectly in our gathered volumes of gas and crude condensates. And even with oil prices and gas prices that are lower year-over-year by 18% and 26% respectively, we're showing durable performance from our portfolio.","Lastly, an update on our Trans Mountain Expansion, this continues to be a two-step forward, one-step back development. I\u2019ll start with the fundamentals, while we consistently hear from our producer customers in Canada, is that they\u2019re counting on this project to get built. Putting the recent fires aside in Alberta, production continues to grow, and takeaway capacity projects continue to be behind the demand. Oil prices have hurt Alberta for sure, so from the perspective of our expansion the supply and demand fundamentals for takeaway capacity are good. For the best of the federal review process as Rich mentioned, we have our NEB recommendation finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government\u2019s undertaking its further consultation process with the objective of final decision in the sum of this year.","We\u2019ve made great progress with communities along the route have, have agreements to support from a majority of the most directly affected first nation today. We are actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their five conditions and we are making very good progress there. We\u2019re going to be actively working with contractors over the summer on the always challenging work on cost and final step for the project.","Finally before turning over to Kim for the financials, I\u2019m going to point out, as you probably noticed, the release is in a slightly different format than usual. What we\u2019re doing, is showing GAAP measures with equal or greater prominent further recent SEC guidance in public companies. As always, we\u2019ll continue to show you all the numbers including the non-GAAP measures that we did. In our management of business, but this is a format, we\u2019ll show in times going forward.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Okay, thanks, Steve. Let me start by reiterating three overall financial points as Rich mentioned today is that we believe you should take away from this call. Number one as Rich said, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance to -- we gave you last quarter. We continue expect that EBITDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF would be approximately 4% below budget. Being consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, this guidance does not include the impact of the SNG JV, which we anticipate will close in the late third or early fourth quarter.","Secondly, we expect in the year at 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA, which is down from our budget guidance and the guidance we gave you last quarter, largely as a result of our balance sheet improvement efforts. When you annualize the EBITDA impact from the SNG transaction, we expect that the full year impact would be slightly higher than the 5.3 times.","And third, our debt-to-EBITDA target still around five times and once we\u2019ve reached that level we will decide how to return value to shareholders, but we\u2019re not committing to specific, not at this time. On our dividend today, we\u2019re declared a dividend of $12.5 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. Looking at our GAAP income statement, we will see that revenues are down significantly. As I say many quarters, we do not believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are necessarily good predictors of our performance.","We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not, which is why you also see a large change in cost of sales during the quarter. In addition, our GAAP numbers could be impacted by non-cash non-recurring accounting entries or what we call certain items.","So if you turn to the second page of numbers, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, I believe you\u2019ll get a better picture of our performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of 1.05 billion versus 1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore, total DCF was down about 45 million or 4%. The segments were down approximately 31 million or 2% with the 59 million decrease in CO2 offsetting increases in terminals and products. The 31 million decrease in the segment was partially offset by a $23 million decrease in G&A and interest expense. In net-out the $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends you get a DCF earnings of 47 million versus the 45 million that we show on the page. There are a bunch of other moving parts, so that gives you the main one.","DCF per share was $0.47 in the quarter versus $0.50 for the second quarter of last year or down $0.03. With about $0.02 associated with the DCF earnings that I just walked you through and about a $0.01 due to the additional shares that we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet.","Therefore, despite approximately 20% decline in commodity prices versus the second quarter of last year, our performance was down approximately 4%. We believe these results demonstrate the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform, primarily fee-based assets. Certain items in the quarter were relatively small, income of approximately $8 million, but let me describe a couple of them that you wouldn't have seen before so you make sure you know what they are. We had a contract early termination revenue which is $39 million of income which is associated with a customer buying out its sourced contracts on one of our Texas intrastate storage fields.","We also had a 21 million in legal and environmental reserves and that was primarily related to settlement of our over 10 year litigation matter with the City of San Diego. Now let me give you a little bit more granularity on our expected performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result of the lower volumes in our midstream groups and 4.5 months in service delay on our EEC, SNG pipeline expansion. As a result of the delay in receiving our FERC certificate.","CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget and essentially here what's happening is we've some price help and cost savings that are offsetting a little bit lower oil and CO2 volumes that we budgeted. We currently expect terminals to end the year about 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the coal bankruptcy. We expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget, due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower rates on our SFPP pipeline, and the sale of our corporate pipeline. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on budget. On the expense side interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis are expected to come in positive versus budget or said another way generate a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest.","And with that I will move to the balance sheet. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $41.3 million in debt that is an increase in debt of about 97 million since the end of last year and it's a decrease in debt versus where we ended the first quarter of about $234 million. So, let me reconcile that for you. DCF in the quarter as I mentioned a moment ago was 1.05 billion. We spent about a little under 870 million on expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We distributed or paid dividends of about 279 million. We received proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of about 220 million and then working capital and other items was a source of cash of about 110 million.","On year-to-date, we generated $2.28 billion in distributable cash flow. We spent about 1.88 on expansion capital, on acquisitions and on contributions to equity investments with the only significant acquisition being the acquisition of the BP Terminal in the first quarter. We paid dividends of $558 million and we have proceeds from asset divestitures and JVs of 220 million and then we had working capital used about 160 million adjusted to the $97 million increase in debt year-to-date. We ended the quarter at about 5.6 times debt-to-EBITDA which is consistent where we ended last year and consistent where we ended the first quarter. And as we've mentioned a couple of times on the call, we expect to end the year at 5.3 times debt-to-EBITDA.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay. And Laura if you'll open the lines we will take any questions that may arise.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Kristina Kazarian","So, I know you guys did this last week so sorry for doing it again, but I have been getting a lot of questions. If you can -- can you guys just help me recap the profile of asset that would be up for JVing, so I know where we talked about Elba, any thoughts on timeframe to that and then TMX is the largest standalone project in the backlog. So, would you be up for doing anything in any way on this one?","Rich Kinder","Yes, so we've not been talking about specific JVs other than what we have put kind of in as a placeholder right when we announced our plans for the year. And there are competitive reasons for doing that. We want to -- we don't want to be hold into anyone particular transaction. We've got some commercial considerations and competitive considerations around counterparties that we're working with there. So we're not identifying for you the whole list of things that we would be considering. But I think it's safe to say that we would look at and evaluate and we could make it work just about anything on our backlog that is separable that we think we can extract good value for and that we can get promoted on and to start a return on it. It will have the kind of the full list. Now a lot of things that are in our backlog are things that are components of our existing network, our existing asset base and so those are a lot harder. The other thing I would point out is, and this was part of our strategy in maintaining some flexibility on what we would work on and what we would get done. We've gotten so far already this year -- we've gotten to a point where we brought our debt-to-EBITDA metrics down to 5.3 which is better than where we expected to end the year. So, I know that's not definitive answer on here is the list of things that we look at doing that's the kind of characteristics of things that we look at doing and we've made great progress on it.","Kristina Kazarian","That's helpful. On TMX, can you remind me what the next step would be if we get the order of council in December?","Rich Kinder","So there is another process going on which is the BC environmental assessment or the environmental certificate I guess you would call it, which we believe will be close to time to when the federal decision comes out may be it lags by a month or so, that's another requirement. And again we're working through the BC condition five process, which is the premier statement of conditions that she would like to see in order to sanction a project, right, and we're making good process on those negotiations.","Kristina Kazarian","And then last one for me it's an asset level one, can you talk a little bit more about the gathered volume number, was this kind of in line with what guys were thinking post-1Q especially in Eagle Ford and then the same thing on that increase in power demand number being up so much?","Rich Kinder","Yes, I would say first on the gathered volumes, we made some good progress during this quarter and maybe a little bit during the last quarter in terms of timing and with signed picture stuff I think 6 with existing shippers at 7 with the new shipper were kind of incentive agreements to try to bring volumes to our system above the contract minimum. So we lost some volumes on our Eagle Ford system that we're now getting back by entering into these arrangements. So it's probably a little bit worse than what we would have been shooting or hooping for but I think we've taken the right steps during the quarter to get some volumes and send it back on the system. And so I look for improvements there.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect well thank you\u2026","Rich Kinder","Yes. And then on power, we were watching to kind of see how power generation would play out. I think I'll say and Tom Martin is here too a little surprised to the upside on the year-over-year improvement when you think about how big of a link we had last year. Now if you look at the year-to-date number it is not quite as strong because we had that weak winter and so Q1 was actually down a bit. But if you look down on a Q2-to-Q2 basis after having a very robust growth from \u201914 to \u201915, we saw growth on top of that of 8% and here I am just talking about our system. So 8% on top of that 16% that we saw before which I think is very strong and I think bodes well. We had another data point there as we had five of our six biggest days for power generation on the SNG system happened in the last 45 days, five of the six biggest.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shneur Gershuni","I just wanted to clarify I guess your response to Kristina's question about new JVing your assets, so if I want to under the backlog correctly if there is a project that's basically a brownfield expansion to an existing asset that makes it more difficult to pull off the JV but not impossible, but more likely to happen on something that is more discrete, is that a fair way to think about it?","Rich Kinder","That is a good way to think about it.","Shneur Gershuni","And then if I remember your call from last week, you've sort of indicated that BS and GS that steel affect that you took an operating asset and then entered into a JV that seemed more of a one-off type of thing and not to really think about that on a go forward basis, does that imply to your CO2 business or is that one segment that you would actually consider JVing or outright telling?","Rich Kinder","Yes as we said last week, I mean in general it's not going to make a lot sense for us in general to be selling interest and I\u2019ve been running assets that tends to be an expensive way to raise capital. It was, I would characterize that it is a somewhat unique opportunity in the SNG case, because what we had there is our largest customer, a great power market in the Southeast U.S. and some specifically identified and agreed to opportunities that we can jointly pursue in this JV that again somewhat unusual for such a transaction would actually make the sale of an interest in existing asset accretive in the medium-term. So I think that the fairly unique situation.","We had as Kim mentioned in some of her updates on the cash numbers proceeds from other asset sales that we did and again they are, I think we\u2019ve had few others they are somewhat exceptional and it\u2019s either a case where, it\u2019s really a case where, the customer on the asset or a third-party has a much higher value or places a higher strategic value on the underlying assets. Parkway was an example there were some others smaller examples during the quarter. We sold the small Transmix facility, which we were essentially just doing spot business through and really not making much of anything on it, we had a third-party who is interested in during more with that asset. And so again I think those are exceptional cases, but where we see them, we go get them.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. If I can follow-up with some financial related questions, I guess first of all the credit market has been a lot more generous on issuers lately versus a couple of months ago. Had there if any thoughts to pre-funding some of the upcoming maturities? And I was wondering if you can also walk us through the delta on maintenance CapEx kind of seems like. Is it seasonal or is this part of your efforts to continue taking some cost out of this structure?","Rich Kinder","Do you want to take the first one?","KimDang","Sure. On the debt side, you\u2019re right. I mean, we could issue tidier bonds right now it\u2019s up 4%, so very attractive market. But we do not have any need to excess to capital markets during 2016. We will continue to evaluate whether it might make economic sense to pre-fund 2017. Obviously, we\u2019re going to be, but we expect later in the year, we\u2019ll be getting proceeds from the SNG transaction and say yes we take that into account as well. On the CapEx, it is sustaining CapEx so we\u2019re going to coming we think probably about within 1% of our budget on sustaining CapEx. And so it is just, it\u2019s really we are running at a positive variance year-to-date versus our budget, but that\u2019s almost entirely timing.","Rich Kinder","Yes. So it is timing of the work, we still plan to do the work. We are getting some cost savings, but we also plan to get the cost savings. So it\u2019s relatively modest beyond what we budgeted for. And as always the work that we\u2019ve identified that we\u2019re doing for compliance and safety, we are focused on getting done and will get done in the year.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And one final question if I may, it may be an offline question. The CO2 business, how much of a benefit are you getting from the hedges this year. Is that something that you\u2019re able to quantify relative to your budgeted guidance?","Kim Dang","It\u2019s about $265 million.","Shneur Gershuni","Perfect. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Operator","Yes. Our next question is from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.","Brandon Blossman","Just one real quick I will ask a very similar question, it is probably a different way. Steve you've made impressive progress both on the capital high grading side and the JV side, it obviously takes pressure off to get anything else done in the very near-term, how would you characterize kind of discussions on either point there, currently and what's your expectations maybe over the next 12 months?","Rich Kinder","Well Brand I think you're right, I mean it does, it puts us in the position of being more patient and selective as we look at any other opportunities really for the balance of the year. So, again that's why we're very pleased with the progress that we've made here in the first half of the year and the fact that it does put us in a position to be more selective about what we want to do going from here.","Tom Martin","That said we're not sitting on our hands, so we'll be looking at all opportunities and again it's our intent to get back as quickly as we can judiciously done to the point where we can return more money to our shareholders, that's our intent, we've been saying that since we made our decision on the dividend last December and I'm just enormously proud the job that Steve and the whole team have done in getting us this far and there's more to come and we're working on it.","Brandon Blossman","And then just a couple of quick ones, with spreads was that still 100% your project or is that 50-50 now?","Kim Dang","No, it's a 100%.","Rich Kinder","Yes, it's a 100% us.","Brandon Blossman","And then coal volumes, is that you said I think Kim you said you are currently slightly under budget on volumes, is that because of the CapEx reduction relative to plan or is that performance on the fields?","Kim Dang","I think it's primarily performance on the fields, and just to hear our sea of speakers and we can comment a little bit more.","Rich Kinder","Yes, I think it's right.","Tom Martin","Yes it's performance, now we are learning more as we go here and we're sharpening our pencils on the programs going forward, but we had less performance so we expected. If you look at the year-over-year, a big part of the year-over-year impact as we had some really what was a I think a record setting in-field program at SACROC, that we saw the benefit of in really from Q4 of '14 through the first half or and so exactly I think it's a 50.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Just a follow-up on that last question so at this level of 220 million or so the investment in your oil business, what's your view of what ongoing decline rate we should expect going forward on your oil volumes?","Rich Kinder","Yes not necessarily expecting an ongoing decline rate, what we do in this business is we're looking at deploying capital that gives us an attractive return on the incremental barrels that we are producing that is associated with that capital spend and so that's kind of how we look at each of our investments here. We don't aim to necessarily look for higher returns, keep production flat or grow it slightly we really make those decisions on each individual capital and investment in the development programs that we spend money on a CO2.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, thanks. And then just had a follow-up, can you just remind me if you have all the approvals that you need from Shells in order to start construction on Elba in the third quarter?","Rich Kinder","We have our contract with Shell. We have a FERC 7C certificate that we received in June, June 1 and what we're waiting on to proceed there is we've got to get through the rehearing process and rehearings were filed I guess 30 days after we got our certificate. So, there is the hearing process that we're going through now that should take 60 days from the date of that filing and we still need that, we've got to get through that process with all the smaller permits we're waiting on\u2026","Tom Martin","And those are permitting.","Rich Kinder","Yes those are eminent.","Tom Martin","Yes.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. And as far as from Shell\u2019s perspective they are aligned with the timing with you guys?","Rich Kinder","I don't know what you mean by aligned with the timing, but it is a requirement for this project that we get a final FERC order and that includes not just the 7C but also the rehearing and so\u2026","Jean Ann Salisbury","Right.","Rich Kinder","Yes.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Gamble from Simmons. Your line is now open.","Brian Gamble","Just a couple of quick follow-ups, Steve you talked about the incentives agreement that you\u2019d able to reach on the gathered volume side, great to see those volumes coming back to the system. Can you give any more color around I guess what types of agreements those are may be not give the exact rates but may be talk about additional opportunities on top of what you have already captured as far as the magnitude of potential volumes as to may come back in the back half of the year?","Rich Kinder","Go ahead.","Steve Kean","Yes, you go first.","Rich Kinder","Yes, I mean the, I think in a broad brush we've got deficiency to be that of our employing in many of these agreements and we're not meeting the volumes associated with that and so anything that we can do and tie incremental volumes incrementally. And get a fee that is downstream we get additional value it make sense to work around that deficiency, so I think that's sort of the general construct I am getting in doing more.","Steve Kean","Yes, I think really that the -- you would rather get the volumes than get paid the deficiency fees and so we're working with our customers the volume brings incremental value than just getting paid the deficiency fees and we will work on the deal and have incremental volume and that is what we think except for both the producing [indiscernible].","Brian Gamble","Is that volume is moving?","Steve Kean","Go ahead.","Brian Gamble","I am sorry was that volume is moving back to your systems that had been going different directions or you actually been incentivizing producers to produce volume that they may have chosen not to based on just making the deficiency\u2026","Steve Kean","I would just probably bring in volume back to our system that they have been going out to other places.","Brian Gamble","Okay, great. And then on the power burn side great to see the Southeast region contributing such huge days to that piece of that business, has there been any change in that recently you mentioned five or six biggest days along 45 days we've also seen a pretty healthy move in the gas price over that time period? Were those five or six days particularly in July or was that more of a June event that may be we're starting to see a little bit of softness as the gas price goes up and any color on the trend there would be great?","Steve Kean","It was June and July.","Rich Kinder","[Indiscernible]","Steve Kean","Yes so I think split fairly evenly.","Rich Kinder","Yes.","Steve Kean","I think it was certainly not a fully June phenomena.","Rich Kinder","Yes so I mean I think generally I think we believe that we're going to be really strong following even at these burn gas prices through the third quarter I think once we get latter part of September and we're still pushing $3 or upper $2 there maybe some switching back. But we're not seeing any indication of that it is just the kind of weather we're seeing right now and expect to see through all that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Darren Horowitz","Just two quick one for me the first with regards to your comments around enhancing shareholder value, I am just curious and I recognize it is kind of cynical, but I am just curious have the impact for the conversion of the preferreds to common shares might influence your preference on which measure of equity value enhance that you choose first meaning if it is a share repurchase to manage some of that incremental dilution or maybe it's a bit more of a balanced approach?","Rich Kinder","Well, I think as we said and Kim has been very clear on when we get that to around 5 which is our target then I think we'll look at what is the most opportune expedient way of returning value to our shareholders and we're not trying to judge in advance. We won't do it just to avoid the potential dilution of the conversion of the spread. We'll look at it whether it makes sense to buyback there is our increase with this. Again that size we're running at a $2 Bcf rate and we're pleased that the stock is rallied here almost the announcement on SNG in the $22 range but that's still about a 9% yield on Bcf. So we look at that and still amazed that it's that high.","Darren Horowitz","Steve one quick on for you just with regard to the Northeast, the expectation there possibly regarding TGP working with customers possibly expanding that since and beyond what is stated and scaling it up with the developments that have transpired since the close of Q1, has anything changed there?","Steve Kean","No we continue to talk to customers but there is nothing definitive there and they -- we're -- the need for NAV in the Northeast is real, it's present and we still think there is, there are capacity needs in that we will talk to our customers and continue to work with them on finding something that make sense, not at the same scale as NAV but perhaps something else. In the main, we're expanding TGP like mad. I mean we are bringing gas down from the Marcellus and Utica down to the new market area if you of the South the Gulf Coast where LNG exports ultimately go into Mexico as well and serving demand down here in Texas as well as power plant laterals of weather project so we're actively investing in TGP but no update really on Northeast utility customer contracts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Tonet","Just wanted to talk about Canada first and given the British Columbia, isn\u2019t necessarily known to be the easiest to do business? Just wondering, if you had any reaction to a bit more thought on reaction as far as what they said, there recently with TMX expansion. And has this enhanced your ability to potentially, kind of buying JV partners here, because it seems like this could be an ideal project to bring in a partner for?","Steve Kean","Yes. So first on BC as I said I think Ian and the team has been making very good progress there. And I assume you\u2019re referring to the energy minister Benet\u2019s comment here recently reported in Bloomberg. We think that the environment overall, I would say is improving and we are making progress and getting matters worked out with BC, but we\u2019re not there yet still working on it. I think that again hypothetically from a JV perspective I mean the more of these kinds of things that we\u2019re able to resolve and get behind us, the more value, there is to a potential investor, but again we\u2019re not, we\u2019ve got nothing active going on, on the project, it\u2019s 100% ours right now. But I think whether it\u2019s 100% ours or ultimately whether there is a partner getting these things taken care of from a regulatory and political standpoint is very helpful.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then just as far as the 5.3 times leverage that you guys are targeting for year-end right now. Does that -- how much incremental asset sales or JVs does that bake in at this point?","Kim Dang","Nothing significant.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ted Durbin","So coming back to the 6.5 times capital-to-EBITDA multiple that you\u2019ve put in the press release, which is now down from the 7.5 times at the Analyst Day. Can you just walk us through the details of how you got from 7.5 to 6.5, I\u2019m assuming it is taking that out of backlog, but what are the other ways is that you are bringing that multiple down on invested capital?","Steve Kean","That is really kind of all the items that I listed out there. We\u2019ve had some contracts restructured, we\u2019ve had some projects and that being the largest one, largest single one that had below average returns compared to the overall backlog that have come out. We\u2019ve also looked for ways to make on all of our projects that there are scope improvements that we can make, cost reductions that we can take on occasionally. Pushing capital out so closer in-time when the project is coming in serve all of those things helped improve the returns and the multiple on the existing project base.","Ted Durbin","Okay. And now with the new project bids, can you just remind us how much this projects actually have take or pay type components or how much of them depend on volumes they were outside of your control, and beginnings in terminals or other places?","Steve Kean","Yes. The majority are going to be under contracts with customers and let\u2019s see I mean on a percentage basis I guess it is actually we do is exclude the CO2 portion of it and generally everything else is going to be under contract.","Ted Durbin","Okay. Great, and so then just stepping back here your earning 6.5 times multiple returns, which is certainly very good returns, at what point do you say it is enough on asset sales, JVs, et cetera. This backlog is too good we actually don't want to may be give this up?","Steve Kean","Yes well, look that the backlog and the projects that we're going to bringing on are part of our effort to improve our DCF per share and so we're going to keep -- but that doesn't mean that we will keep trying to find ways to optimize the scope and do other things that are going to boost returns. Going forward we've said fairly high, look we're in a at self funding world right now and so we'll continue to look for incremental project opportunities but we've raised our return criteria to something again that's all -- it always varies on any individual project depending on the risks and rewards but we kind of used as a little sum of 15% unlevered after tax return. So, we continue to look for those projects and have authorized several along the way through the year, but we'll look to boost returns on what we have but -- and we'll raise our return thresholds as we look at incremental capital investments.","Ted Durbin","And then if I could just sneak one more on Trans Mountain I guess any update on your views on the cost there to meet the 107 conditions probably you have some time to go through there and just remind us if you have any ability to -- if there was cost more higher to pass this cost through to customers?","Steve Kean","We're working on the cost right now and working with our contractors right now and kind of will be over the -- really over the course of the summer and what contractors always want more than we want pay them and we're going to be pushing back hard on that process over the course of the summer, to try to keep costs down and under control. Once we arrive at a cost that we turn over to our shippers and our final estimate which will be sometime early next year or maybe later this and maybe late this year. Okay then if we have flow through protection on certain identified uncontrollable costs and that includes things that's once we've set the price right, once the cost has been set and that includes things like First Nation\u2019s costs, steel costs, one of the more complex spreads through the mountain and then the last 40 miles, 40 kilometers into lower mainland.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Faisel Khan","A few questions, first I just want to go back to something your answers around the gathered volumes and I am a little bit confused so, if you climb from roughly 3.5 this year the day and gather volumes down to almost three a day and I think Steve what you're saying is that's basically it a lot of that was sort of volumes above the RMPC and now you are saying that is stabilized going forward?","Steve Kean","Well what happens in the basin will drive a lot of that, right, I mean we're starting to see some people come back to the Eagle Ford but you not only have to come back you have to bring a lot of rigs back in order to see that flatten out and then start to increase and frankly I don't think the basin is at that point yet and so most of what we've been focusing on is where we lost some volumes to third parties we're trying to accept those to come back to the system rather just collecting the deficiency charges from those customers. And as I said I think we've made some good progress over the course of the quarter in doing that. But, so long as the overall basin is declining what we're doing is fighting off decline and trying to stay above that decline rate if you will, but I don't know you don't -- it depends on whether the basic decline starts to slow I think and level out.","Now, I will point out too that we haven't talked about Highland we actually had year-over-year and over budget improvement on our Highland gathering assets in North Dakota a lot of that was due to also restructuring of contracts as primarily migrating them from a percent of proceeds to fee based which gives us both greater stability but also happen to have a beneficial impact on this year's earnings. So, we talked a lot about Eagle Ford in the Haynesville we've done an arrangement to try to incent a current customer to do some drilling and there what we've done is we've divided if you will the contract between what's already under contract to us and new or incremental wells and providing discounts there to try to incent some drilling. But again the overall gathering picture is primarily driven by what the overall basin picture is.","Faisel Khan","Okay. But I mean to go from 3.5 to under 3 in two quarters is pretty extreme, and is that level of decline going to continue into end of the year?","Steve Kean","Now I think we may see some decline but it won't be at that rate.","Faisel Khan","Okay. Got it, and then the Eagle Ford volumes you talked about that's just on the liquid side the 3 going from 3.44 down to 3.04 that's what you're talking about there or is it another mix of gasoline you're talking about within the gathered volumes sets?","Steve Kean","Those are significant gas gathered volumes in the Eagle Ford as well from our Eagle Ford gathering system and the assets that we acquired from Copano and those 3 knocked us into our overall gas gathering volumes that we report on the numbers page.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And that make sense on the G&P side then on the CO2 production volumes. I just want to go back to a question that was asked before, so a 15% decline in volumes here year-over-year that's not the natural here the feel of that grand number correctly I mean I saw that the CO2 does not stay on a lot of capital and in fact locking gates volumes might decline by about may be mid single-digits based on how much your 2 year checked in this that 15% seems like a lot?","Rich Kinder","Yes it's just, yes -- no it's not a natural decline, as Steve said earlier we had a record quarter and half year in \u201915 based on a very successful in-field program the candidates is not as prolific in the area at the moment so that's really the driver period-to-period it's the success of that particular in-field project.","Faisel Khan","Okay. So what is the natural decline that fuels from here on out that you could give me a best guesstimate?","Rich Kinder","Yes, it's probably more along the 6% to 9% in on the area [indiscernible].","Faisel Khan","Okay, understood. The last question for me, just on the asset sale program there was some trade publication news that you were in the market to sell the Jones Act tanker business is that still an asset that is on the market or and have you pulled back that asset from the market?","Rich Kinder","And again Faisel we're not really talking about specific processes or assets for the reasons I said earlier.","Faisel Khan","So one more I will make it quick, the drive to get the current capital to shareholders as quickly as possible, I am just wondering is -- so you have a lot of -- you've announced about an asset sales already I am just wondering do you risk sort of going racing too quickly to return capital back to shareholders and maybe not retaining assets that may have sort of better value over the longer term. So I am just trying to understand sort of that balance between of asset sales and returning capital back to shareholders over a certain time period?","Rich Kinder","I think it is a balancing process and we're certainly not going to sell anything that doesn't make sense strategically for us and that's why for the most part and Steve as explained I think very clearly the thought behind the joint venture with Southern Company on SNG but beyond that our effort has been concentrated on new projects where we could bring something in who would reward us for the efforts we have made on those projects thus and participate heads up with us on a going forward. So I think we're trying to balance it very carefully and we're not going to rush into anything that doesn't make sense strategically we're obviously in this for the very long-tern.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is now open.","Craig Shere","I got three questions here. The first pretty quick on the fall to 6.5 times what I think was guides 6.7 times CapEx do you saw on the remaining non-CO2 growth CapEx, is that mostly on the efficiencies and that gas pipeline project restructuring and were monetized projects complete a Mongolia tanker at higher multiples?","Rich Kinder","I think Mongolia would have been in there all along so really it's the contract restructuring, it's the Utopia JV and those would probably the two main contributors to it, but also we have as I said we have looked for ways to touch stand or reduce scope where we had the opportunity to do so without and enhance return as a result, those are probably the two biggest single components.","Craig Shere","And kind of a bigger picture, I know the balance sheet repair and having a flexibility to return money to shareholders is foremost in your mind, but of course if you had to make a choice and you had unlimited ability to reinvest at 6.5 times EBITDA certainly that would be preferable to returning money to shareholders. Currently excluding CO2 and CO2 I think you have about $10 billion of proportional spend now for \u201916 to 2020 and over half of that was Trans Mountain, how would handicap prospects for the fee based outstanding growth CapEx inventory to materially fill in and expand over the next couple of years?","Rich Kinder","Well again as we have said trying to balancing things there are 2 thing we're trying to accomplish here, one is we want to get our debt-to-EBITDA down into the City of five times okay. The other thing we want to do is for all the DCF per share and that involves investing in project as we\u2019ve described and getting good returns for the capital that we do deploy. And we\u2019re doing this in a context of being self funding. So we are trying to make sure that we are dedicating our capital that we have to the best returns we can get and not be in a position where we have to excess the capital market, where we have to excess the capital market. And so those are really the things that we are balancing. We remain focused on getting the balance sheet in order and in improving our DCF per share. And we believe following that course will allow us to be in a position to return cash to shareholders.","I think if you look at what our opportunities and it remains to be seen what the total investment opportunity is going to be out there, but I think there is a very reasonable case right a reasonable scenario where we\u2019re in a situation where we\u2019re generating significantly more cash, particularly if these projects come online or cash than we\u2019re investing and when we\u2019re in that position, we\u2019re going to be also in a position to either as we said multiple times either further delever the balance sheet or return value to shareholders in the form of buybacks or increase the dividends. And as we get closer in time to that we\u2019ll be evaluating which one of those approaches is the best way for maximizing, to maximize shareholder value.","Craig Shere","Understood, I just, what I\u2019m trying to get at is that there is a much higher value proposition potential. And that is if you get close to five times net debt-to-EBITDA towards the end of next year and we have this flexibility we still can issue 10 year debt, and it\u2019s up 4%. If you could fund half the cost of all of your growth CapEx at 6.5 times with cheap debt, you would have enormous amount of free cash flow to both fund growth CapEx and return to shareholders. And I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, if you think that having additional projects in line would be attractive than what you currently have, I mean there was a point you had over 20 billion of inventory. Do you think that there is prospect for the next two-three years to start to charge that?","Rich Kinder","Yes look that\u2019s a possibility and that is absolutely something we will look at. But again the place we\u2019re trying to maintain ourselves right now is not to have the excess the capital market, it doesn\u2019t mean that on the right terms and conditions we wouldn\u2019t.","Craig Shere","Okay. Last question CO2, I think for the entire segment that was originally budget 1.8 billion of growth CapEx over the five year plan. I think the forwards strips in \u201916, \u201917 are above your plan assumptions the longer term strips are still stubbornly low. Any reason to think about particularly what some of the volumes staying less than originally anticipated any reason to think about that spend over the five years coming in?","Rich Kinder","Five years coming in...","Craig Shere","They are all like plus or either 1.8.","Rich Kinder","As a matter of fact we\u2019re up slightly from the 1.8 in the first Q. At the current strip, we have, the 1.8 still fits and works at the current strip.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Chris Sighinolfi","Just a couple a quick follow-ups from me I guess Kim starting with CO2 for a moment, you've been willing to give us some updates in prior call on hedge book and activity I'm just wondering if there's been any update on the hedge positions if so if you could sort of update us as to where you stand?","KimDang","As we've said on the last call we continue to lay on as if in a programmatic fashion and not just stay in line with our hedge policy but for '17 or 51% hedge is $68, 36% in '18, $73, 24% in \u201919 at $60, about 6% in '20, that's $49.","Chris Sighinolfi","And then with regards, I think you had said earlier on the call that there were $175 million of sort of arranged sales and the products difference and I was curious if you had a press release out whether about the product I was curious if you could quantify how much of it was that?","Rich Kinder","No we can't due to confidentiality commitments, cannot talk about the specifics but we will try to give you some -- I've got a little bit of guidance here, if you aggregate all those things that we sold that there is enough cheesing out part way okay but it's just aggregate the other, it was a terminal asset that was sold and of the 3 total assets sold $172 million in proceeds and the EBITDA multiple was about 13.5 times.","Chris Sighinolfi","I also had a question just with regard to Trans Mountain, if that project is one way goal and ago and all was said and done could you I don't know if you know at this point or could help us think about how the new cadence spend would go on that asset particularly in 2017 and '18 or is it mostly concentrated in the final year?","Rich Kinder","Kim?","Kim Dang","It's concentrated in '18 and '19.","Rich Kinder","In '19, we won't start actual pipe construction until late summer of '17, so, I would say that you think about '18 and '19 that's the end of cadence when projects will complete with a half year in '17 is the way things run.","Chris Sighinolfi","And then I think just final question from me, I don't mean to be a dead horse but I want to revisit sort of the balancing act that you spoke about with spiral and then Craig\u2019s efforts, or comments around sort of the deleveraging efforts versus capital deployment opportunities. Steve recognize and if you don't you need access to capital markets but I'm just wondering like at what point, what are the conditions under which you would like if the -- I get that the effort around JVing on in flight projects is seemingly the most attractive thing, but if the party can bring something to that other than just capital. We are obviously seeing asset sales but it's kind of tricky when you're selling underlying cash flow and utilizing some of the NOL balance. So, I'm just curious is like to go around delevering, where and when and if equity issuance would play into that?","Kim Dang","Well I think at this price level we don't want to issue equity and so look I think right now we're going to live within our cash flow and I think that as we look out in time we want to do projects. So, we want to do projects that have good returns on them and so if they have good returns and we think that will be value creating to our investors. And so if we can do projects at 6.5 times EBITDA then that is going to be priority, but as we look out in time and we look at the backlog that we have and we look at the potential opportunities that there may be, we see that there is probably going to be cash flow in excess of the capital project once the balance sheet is repaired. And so that's why we're saying once the balance sheet repairs then at that point in time we will be in the position to return value to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends because we think there will be some projects, don't get me wrong, but we just think that the cash flow that we will have will exceed that amount of projects.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question at this time is from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Edwards","Well it is just a couple of just real quick ones for me just, do you have the breakout of the subsectors for the backlog if you could give that to us now?","Rich Kinder","Yes, so natural gas is still about 30% of the backlog in the current, so this is the 13.5 that we're talking about\u2026","John Edwards","Yes exactly.","Rich Kinder","Yes, gas is 30%, products after the JV is sitting at 2%, terminal is at 15%, CO2 is 14% and then KM Canada carrying a project that's a $5.4 billion is 40%.","John Edwards","Okay. And then just what has changed from the -- you said it came down about 1 billion was it mostly coming out of natural gas?","Rich Kinder","Yes it came down from 14.1 to 13.5 and so 600 million and there were projects that rolled into service. We also in the previous backlog did not have a Utopia JV assumption but the JV of Utopia had an impact on that it was part of the decline. And then as I mentioned we have restructured a contract with a customer actually boosted the return but that's also reduced the capital associated with that particular project and those are the three biggest things and then there were some fairly modest project additions that went the other way.","John Edwards","Okay. And then just my only other one is just can you quantify the amount of deficiency payments you are receiving?","Rich Kinder","I don't have that number. At that is not something we track separately so no.","John Edwards","All right, that's it from me thanks.","Operator","At this time speakers I show no further questions in queue.","Steve Kean","Okay. Well, thank you very much everybody. Have a good evening and thanks for dialing in for this.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Go ahead, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Sharon and welcome to our first quarter analyst call. As usual, we\u2019ll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. I'll give an overview of the quarter, then Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, will talk about the performance of our five business segments and give you an update on our backlog of expansion projects. And then our CFO, Kim Dang, will explain the financial results in detail, and then we'll take any questions that you might have.","Our Board today voted to increase the dividend for the first quarter to $0.48 or $1.92 annualized. That\u2019s up 14% from the first quarter of 2014 when we paid a dividend of $0.42 per share. And it\u2019s a 7% increase from the $0.45 we paid for the fourth quarter of 2014.","This is consistent with our announced intention of declaring $2 per share in dividends for \u201815, the full year of 2015, which would be a 15% increase over full-year 2014. And we are on track to do just that. We also continue to project growth in that dividend of 10% per year off of that $2 base out through 2020.","Our DCF per share was $0.58 for the first quarter, which equates to coverage in excess of our dividend of $206 million. Now, any comparison with the first quarter of \u201814 is a little bit apples to oranges, because of course we didn\u2019t roll up KMP, KMR and EPB until the fourth quarter of 2014.","That said, I think the simplest comparison is this. In the first quarter of \u201814, we had 1.036 billion shares outstanding. We had DCF of $0.55 per share. We declared a dividend of $0.42 per share, which resulted in excess coverage of approximately $138 million.","This quarter we had 2.159 billion shares outstanding. We had DCF of $0.58 per share. We declared a dividend of $0.48 per share, and that resulted in excess coverage of about $206 million. So we more than doubled the number of shares, we increased the dividend by 14% and we still substantially increased our excess coverage. All in an environment of dramatically lower commodity prices.","For example, our average realized oil price per barrel in our CO2 segment was $72.62 in the first quarter of \u201815 versus $91.89 in the same quarter a year ago. And the average Henry Hub price for natural gas was $2.98 in the first quarter of \u201815 versus $4.94 in the first quarter of \u201814. This demonstrates to me that our enormous footprint and our diversified set of mostly fee-based assets can produce very good results, even in times of tumultuous market conditions.","Notwithstanding the lower commodity prices, we experienced good volume growth in most of our businesses. For example, our natural gas transportation volumes were up 6%, our refined products volumes were up 5.6%. Our condensate volumes more than tripled. Our net oil production and our CO2 segment was up 9%. And our liquids throughput in our Terminals group was up 23%.","In short, we expect to continue to perform well in 2015, pay our dividend as originally targeted at $2 with substantial excess coverage as we\u2019ve demonstrated this quarter. And believe we are setting the table for years of good growth.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Thanks, Rich. I\u2019ll give you an update on the project backlog. Also update you on two projects that are not in the backlog, and give you some operational commercial highlights from the segments.","Since our January update, on a comparable basis, the backlog decreased a little bit by about $200 million. The main changes were that we added 1.1 billion in new investments to the backlog, about 40% of that is the addition of the high probability portion of the Hiland backlog. And the balance is made up primarily of additional gas pipeline and terminals expansions.","We put into service almost $400 million worth of projects during the quarter, with half of that represented by the startup of the first condensate splitter of our two splitter project in Houston ship channel. But just taking into account what we added and what went into service, we grew the backlog by $700 million even while putting into service $400 million worth of projects. The big offset to what would have been a net addition to the backlog is the removal of about $900 million, the vast majority of which came from our CO2 business. ","And so what\u2019s going on there is while CO2 source development is economic along our existing infrastructure, meaning Southwest Colorado and the Cortez pipeline, new developments -- and we're going to continue to expand our capability there. It's harder to make new CO2 developments work in the current commodity price environment.","So we pushed St. John's field and the Lobos pipeline developments outside the time frame of the backlog. In this price environment, that's simply the wise thing to do. New CO2 source developments aside, I think the takeaway here is that we continue to see strong demand for expansion of our midstream pipeline and terminals businesses, notwithstanding the lower commodity price environment.","As the release points out, we also made a methodology change and we're moving overhead now. So our backlog currently, including capitalized overhead and the capital portion of the backlog and in the CapEx in the backlog, and we\u2019ll consistently state it this way going forward. So our backlog now stands at 18.3 billion. The reason we're including overhead is capitalized overhead is included when we make the investment decision. It's in our return calculations. And when we give you guys indications of returns or EBITDA multiples on investments, we're typically giving those with overhead included. But the numbers I just went through are stating the changes from last quarter to this on a comparable basis.","Two other projects that we have not put in the backlog yet, first is Northeast Direct. Now there we've made great progress. We\u2019ve received significant commitments from LDC customers for the market portion of that project, over 550 a day of commitment. And there's a very compelling economic need for this project. After two very tough winters, it's apparent that additional gas capacity is needed in the Northeast. In fact, the extra cost of energy, just the electric portion of energy costs in New England these last two winters, would have paid for both the supply and market portions of this project which is about a $5 billion investment. The highest gas prices in North America and the lowest prices are only a few hundred miles apart, which suggests very strongly to us that a new pipeline should be built. We're getting close here.","We're looking to secure some additional commitments from the power sector, and we believe that our project is well positioned to serve substantial share of the gas fired power demand in the region. But we have not yet put this in the backlog. Again, we're getting close, we've made substantial progress.","Now for UMTP. So this is our proposed conversion of an existing Tennessee gas pipeline -- gas line to NGL service from the Utica and Marcellus to the Texas Gulf coast. First, we continue to believe that this also is a good long-term project for producers both in terms of the cost of the outlet for them, but also in terms of the quality and option value of the markets that it would let them access. We get them to Mont Belvieu and potentially to [water] for export and we think that, in the long run, is going to be valuable to producers. ","Second, we revised our offering to the market to contemplate a batched system rather than a pure y-grade system. Which gives producers with various commodities and commodity mixes to have more transport options. So we've improved, we think, the offering that the market is looking at now. This has attracted interest, but we don't have any signatures yet. So it's not in the backlog. ","We also filed this quarter for the abandonment of the TGP line that would allow us to convert this line to NGL service. And when we look at the economics of UMTP, we burden it with the CapEx that we would expect to spend on TGP to replace the capacity that we would be using when we convert. And then finally on this project, a reminder that we do have the option of keeping it in gas service if the market commitments for liquids transport don't materialize.","Now for the segment review. Just doing the year-over-year comparison on the quarter, earnings before DD&A for the gas pipeline segment was 1.087 billion, that's up 1% year-over-year. That's the addition of the Hiland assets, strong performance from EPNG and our South Texas midstream assets, offsetting a weaker performance in our other gas midstream assets.","Recall also that last year, we had a major shipper buyout of its contract on Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline, and so we are seeing year-over-year negative from that event. But up 1% year-over-year. We had transport volumes, as Rich mentioned, 6% higher across the segment.","We also had higher sales volumes, which is primarily in our intrastate business also up by 6%. And gathering volumes were up by 12%, although the latter were aided by the Hiland acquisition. We also saw increased power burn on our [indiscernible] -- our SNG system as a result of coal to gas switching.","We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transport capacity. We added another 600 million a day of transport commitments during the quarter with a volume weighted average term length of 13.5 years, and about a third of that capacity was existing previously unsold capacity. That brings the total that we've signed up since December of 2013 to 7.3 DCF of new and pending commitments, with an average term length of almost 17 years.","So the summary here is we continue to see strong demand for existing and expansion capacity on our gas assets. Though on the expansion side, we're starting to see more of a field to market pull rather than the producer push we've been seeing in previous years.","Turning now to CO2. Segment earnings before DD&A in this segment were $281 million, down 85 million or 23% year-over-year. Clearly due to lower commodity prices. Our existing EOR developments and the developments of CO2 sources in our existing footprint remain economic. But again, clearly, commodity prices are impacting this segment in particular.","Our volumes are up year-over-year. Led by SACROC, which is up 13%, with an overall increase of 9% across all of our EOR developments. Katz and Goldsmith are also up year-over-year, but are still well under plan. We are also extracting some cost savings in this price environment. We've locked in a fair amount already. We're expecting we're going to do a little bit better, and expect we'll end up on our OpEx and maintenance CapEx of savings north of 20%. And as, I mentioned, we also removed significant capital expenditures from this segment as we discussed in the backlog update.","Now turning to Products Pipelines, segment earnings before DD&A were $245 million. That's up 20% year-over-year. That's driven by the ramp up of volumes on our KMCC system in Texas, including the startup of the splitter project, the first splitter there. As well as an increase in our volumes on our refined products system in the west SFPP, offset in part by unfavorable inventory pricing in our transmix business. In this segment, we see the upside of lower commodity prices. We saw refined products up quarter-to quarter, year-over-year by 5.6%.","Now we continue to advance our Palmetto refined products pipeline which is under contract, our Utopia NGL pipeline, and our second splitter in the Houston ship channel, all of those are under contract and in the backlog. Turning to Terminals. Segment earnings before DD&A were $264 million, up 16% from last year. 70% of that is attributable to organic growth. We continued to see strong performance in our Gulf Coast liquids facilities. And earnings benefited from our expansions in Edmonton, and in the Houston ship channel. On the bulk side, steel volumes are lower, as are coal volumes, but we are protected on that commodity by contract minimums. The liquids part of this segment is also driving the growth projects, as we're establishing great positions in the Edmonton and Houston hubs for liquids.","In Edmonton, our expansion projects including the baseline terminal JV with Keyera that we recently announced will bring our merchant crude storage position there to 12 million barrels. The largest in the area, and up from zero 10 years ago. In Houston, our expansions will get us to 43 million barrels and over 2 million barrels of the Vopak acquisition. And that's primarily liquid fuels, refined products. So we continue to build strong positions in these two markets, and very importantly, we continue to add connectivity to our assets in each of these markets which further enhances the value of our positions there.","Finally for Kinder Morgan Canada, a quick update on our $5.4 billion expansion of Trans Mountain. We are half past the halfway mark on the NEB process. We're still expecting to see draft conditions this summer, and we expect to get the final NEB recommendation in January of 2016. Just as important, I think, while you wouldn't know it from reading the press clippings or the twitter feeds, we're making very good progress on our work with communities and First Nations along the route as well. Most of our route is in our current pipeline corridor, except where community or land owner needs dictative variation. So we have existing relationships with many of the communities and First Nations along the way, and now we're showing some results.","We have community benefit agreements that cover 87% of the route, as you'd expect, there isn\u2019t -- we don't have any in the lower mainland of British Columbia. But we have 87% of the route covered with community benefits agreements which are in support of the project. We also have agreements with about a third of the First Nations that are most directly affected by the project. We'd like to have more, but this is still very good progress. There's clearly vocal opposition along the last few kilometers in the lower mainland. We've made some progress there too though. We're researching a tunneling alternative that would -- and have demonstrated, we believe, the feasibility of a tunneling alternative that would reduce the impact of the expansion on some of those communities, and potentially accommodate the relocation of the existing pipeline as well.","So overall, good progress on this project that's maybe not readily apparent from the press and social media. And again a reminder here, this project is under long-term contracts which have been approved by the NEB. So that's the segment and project update. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Thanks, Steve. Let me start first with the GAAP income statement and one comment on it before I move to distributable cash flow. If you look on the GAAP income statement, you can see that revenues are down about 11% or 450 million. But if you also look at OpEx, it's down by 531 million or 25%. And the largest contributor to this move in revenue and OpEx is our Texas intrastate business where we buy and sell natural gas. Now we largely match up our purchases and sales. For example, if we enter into a contract to buy at Houston ship channel minus we also enter into a contract to sell that Houston Ship Channel flat; with the result being a fixed margin of 10%, but your revenues and expenses are going to fluctuate with commodity prices. We also have somewhat similar characteristics in some of our other assets in our portfolio, and that's what's contributing to this large change in the revenue and OpEx.","Now changes in revenues, we don't think are good predictor of our performance. We continue to believe that the best predictor of our performance is change in distributable cash flow per share, and the change in the dividends per share. But given the large change during the quarter, we thought that was important to explain. So moving to the second page of our -- of numbers in our press release, which is KMI's calculation of distributable cash flow which we reconcile to GAAP net income. We use distributable cash flow as a measure of the cash we have available to pay dividends. The same format that we used in the fourth quarter of last year for KMI and DCF is calculated as net income excluding certain items plus DD&A, plus book taxes, minus cash taxes, minus sustaining CapEx, plus or minus some other small items.","In addition, for periods presented prior to the fourth quarter consolidation transaction, in this case Q1 2014, we also subtract distributions declared by KMP and EPB to arrive at KMI's distributable cash flow. For the first quarter in 2015, there are no longer distributions to KMP and EPB, and so all of the distributable cash flow is available to pay dividends on the KMI shares. But the KMI share count has also increased significantly, primarily as a result of other shares issued in the consolidation transaction to acquire the MLPs. So for the quarter, distributable cash flow per share $0.58 versus the declared distribution today of $0.48. We have over $200 million in coverage in the quarter. Distributable cash flow, the total number is $1.242 billion, up $669 million or 117%.","But as I said a moment ago, a lot of that is coming because we're not paying the distributions down at the MLPs. If you look at our segments for the quarter, segment earnings before DD&A $1.912 billion, which is roughly flat with where we were a year ago. For the full year right now, what we're expecting versus our budget, notwithstanding the significant decline in commodity prices, we expect on segment earnings before DD&A for the full year versus our budget to be within about 1% of what we budgeted. The other moving pieces go to G&A expense, in the quarter, $169 million, it\u2019s a $6 million increase from last year. We expect versus our budget to be about 4% above our budget, largely as a result of the Hiland transaction. Without the Hiland transaction, we would be pretty close to our budget on G&A.","On interest for the quarter, $514 million, that's up $69 million versus the first quarter in 2014. All as a result of higher balance. The average rate is actually down slightly. Versus our budget for the full year, what we're expecting is to be above our budget by about 1%, all as a result of Hiland. If -- without the Hiland acquisition, we would actually have less interest expense in our budget, we'd be favorable to our budget by about 2% on interest expense.","A couple of the other big moving pieces in the DCF calculation, cash taxes in the quarter were a $2 million positive because we got some state tax refunds. Versus our budget for the full year, we're expecting also to be positive by about $10 million. Sustaining CapEx in the quarter, $104 million of sustaining capital expenditures, that's actually running less than what we budgeted, but that's timing.","For the full year, we expect to be above our budget on sustaining CapEx as a result primarily of the Hiland acquisition. But also even without the Hiland acquisition, we'd be about 1% above our budget due to some higher relocation expenses than we anticipated.","Now in terms of coverage for the full year, you will recall that our budget for coverage for the full year was $654 million. And that was predicated on a $70 per barrel oil price, and $3.80 gas. We showed sensitivity at the analyst conference at various prices. But we highlighted at $50 a barrel and $3 in gas, which is pretty close to where we've been running, that our coverage would be about $430 million, so about a $224 million decrease due to commodity exposure. And we currently expect that our commodity price impact for the full year will be largely consistent with that. ","In addition to the decrease in commodity prices we currently expect about a $50 million negative impact in our midstream natural gas segment from lower volumes. And some negative impact from FX and our KMC and Terminals business. But even after taking these negatives into account, we would expect to be better than the $430 million that we\u2019ve showed you. As result of the Hiland acquisition, interest savings and CO2 cost savings.","Now with respect to the timing of our coverage, it\u2019s not evenly split. We expect to generate the greatest amount of coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter. We may have negative coverage in Q2, but again, we still expect to have significant excess coverage up for the full year.","Now let me spend a second on our certain items. The largest certain items in the quarter; first of all, the loss on asset disposals or impairments, is largely associated with some impairments on some small Copano assets, $79 million. That\u2019s being largely offset by mark-to-market ineffectiveness, primarily on our CO2 hedges, which is timing. We\u2019ll continue to recognize the results of those hedges at the time of physical settlement in the segment.","And then the other large item is 23 million of fair value amortization. And this is a couple of different things, but let me give you an example of what fair value amortization is. When we bought our-- the ships, APT last January, the contracts on some of those ships were considered to be under market. But we recognized an asset on our balance sheet which we amortize to revenue, or it\u2019s a liability on our balance sheet which we amortized to revenue over time which is non-cash. So we\u2019re not taking credit for this fair value amortization, and we have certain other examples of that primarily impacting interest expense. So the certain items for the quarter actually total $14 million of income. So largely, they offset each other. ","Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with debt of $42.8 billion, and that results in a debt to EBITDA of 5.8 times. Now that is higher than what we would have expected, and that\u2019s primarily due to the Hiland acquisition. ","We only have one and a half months of earnings in our EBITDA from the Hiland acquisition. But we\u2019ve got all the debt, and in fact, slightly more debt than we expect to have when we have our long-term capital structure in place with respect to that acquisition. But we still expect to end the year at about 5.6 times consistent with the budget. By that time, we will have completed all the equity with respect to Hiland. And we will have 10.5 months of the EBITDA included in our debt to EBITDA.","The change in debt for the quarter is $2.2 billion increase in debt from December 31st. Let me walk you through that reconciliation. We spent about 4.06 billion in our investment program. That\u2019s $3.2 billion in acquisition, with the largest piece of that being $3.06 billion on Hiland. We spent about $800 million on expansion CapEx, and we made about $30 million in contributions to equity investments, primarily Eagle Hawk and Elba. We issued equity of 1.6 billion. Now let me point out, that 1.6 billion you\u2019re going to see is different from the 1.745 billion that you saw in the press release. And that\u2019s because -- primarily because some of the proceeds from this equity issuance were received after March 31st. So we issued the shares on March 31st or before, but because things settle on T plus 3, some of the proceeds were received after the quarter closed.","We have coverage of a little over $200 million. We received an income tax refund related to our 2014 taxes of $194 million. And this is because of the depreciation associated -- primarily because the depreciation associated with the consolidation transaction that we received in 2014, as well as a few other items.","Accrued interest was a use of working capital of about 114 million. Interest payments primarily occur in the first quarter and in the third quarter, so we typically have a use of working capital for accrued interest in those quarters. And then we have a use of working capital for other items of about $60 million to get you to a $2.2 billion increase in debt.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Kim. Thank you, Steve. And with that, Sharon, if you\u2019ll come back on, we\u2019ll take any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open. ","Shneur Gershuni ","I just wanted to start off at a high level. There's been a lot of attention about M&A. The recent Royal Dutch deal and so forth. And given your interest in M&A as you've explained at the Analyst Day and so forth, I was wondering if you can give us some color as to what you're seeing out there? Are there distressed assets available or non-strategic assets coming up for sale? Have bid asks narrowed a little bit? Can we expect Kinder Morgan to be active in the coming months, or as things moved with the price of oil and so forth?","Rich Kinder","I think you can expect us to be active in the coming months. Answering the last part of your question first. Obviously, we've made two acquisitions already, the 3 billion, 3.1 billion Hiland and then the Vopak Terminal acquisition, which was a little over $160 million. So we've not been sitting on the sidelines. That said, we continue to look for things. But obviously, they have to be a fit both in terms of accretion to our shareholders, to our distributable cash flow and doability. And there's a lot of cheap money out there chasing deals right now. And that's pretty common knowledge how much money has been injected into the energy patch just in the last few weeks. But I'd like to get Dax Sanders, our Corporate Development Vice President, to maybe expand on it a little bit. Dax?","Dax Sanders","As you said, we've spent a lot of time looking at various potential opportunities. But as you well know, with acquisitions you've got to have three things. You've got to number one, want the assets, number two, you've got to have valuation work, and number three, you've got to get past the social issues. And I think there are certainly things out there; I think that bid offer spreads certainly do continue to persist. And notwithstanding that, there are certain things that are transacting. Obviously, we were able to get Hiland done.","I think we certainly have, as Rich said, an appetite for more acquisitions. And I think we've got a good track record of executing on acquisitions, and successfully integrating them. And I think we've got plenty of capacity and ability to execute and integrate other additional acquisitions and we continue to spend a lot of time on it.","Shneur Gershuni","A couple of quick follow-ups. We've spent a lot of time in the energy world talking about the price of oil over the last couple months. But natural gas prices have been down quite a bit as well too. When I look at the changes that you announced for your backlog, the only change so far is really -- negatively speaking has been in the CO2 business and you've been successful in adding projects as well also.","I was wondering if you can talk to how the natural gas price may impact your backlog and\/or the shadow backlog on a go forward basis. Could we see potential negative revisions, or are you immune to it?","Rich Kinder","I'll start, and then I'll ask either Steve or Tom Martin to comment on that. But the overriding principle here is that we are seeing a dramatic increase in natural gas usage. Long term, we expect it to go from the 74 BCF, 75 BCF a day today to 110 BCF in the next 10 years. That's being driven by demand pull and supply push, but a tremendous opportunity for the largest midstream player like us. And we're just seeing indications of that. Steve mentioned what increase in our capacity sign-ups that we've had again just in this quarter. But I think the main thing here is, that this demand will continue to drive more growth and we're certainly seeing those opportunities.","Steve Kean","The demand side is where it's happening. The big example would be Northeast Direct if we get that done. Now there's a supply -- the supply [indiscernible] that is a combination of demand pull and supply push. But we're going to see demand pull if Northeast Direct gets under contract coming from LDCs and power plants. And that's the biggest chunk. Now what Tom's team added in this last quarter was also power plant -- expansions for power plants, signing up some capacity with utilities that was previously unsold. So you definitely see the demand pull starting to show up.","From a backlog standpoint purely, again, NED is the big deal. Northeast Direct is the big deal. If you break down the rest of the market and say, well, there's going to be additional gas demand to the extent that it comes through a gas utility, then I think you'll see contracts get underwritten for expansions to -- and we announced one on NGPL here just yesterday, expansions will get underwritten. When you're talking about power plants, it's a little bit more of a mix. Some power plants in a vertically integrated utility, they can commit to long-term contracts. When you look at industrial and petchem, those guys typically are not signing up for long-term contracts. They expect to connect and then be able to buy their gas. But even in that case, as Rich said, that's pulling demand up on the system. And that makes the underlying system more valuable, and it drives expansions even in a more of a market pull environment.","The other thing, and we've emphasized this in the past is that -- is storage. A lot of people think about and we think about transport, but we've signed up about 3 BCF in storage so far for LNG customers. We think they're going to need sign up for more. That 3 BCF came out of existing inventory. And when you think about our power plant demand and LNG demand that implies a certain amount of storage that's going to be needed in order to manage the fluctuations in that demand. So I think the market pull, part of this will again continue to enhance the value of the network.","Tom Martin","I guess the last part I think to the question you were asking is the range of the shadow backlog. And I think we talked about something in the $17.5 billion range just in the gas group alone at the analyst conference, and I think that number is still pretty good as to where we see opportunities at this point in time. And a big chunk of that is NED, which I think we're getting ever closer to moving forward on.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And one final question, Kim, you had mentioned the reconciliation on the equity that was issued under the ATM and so forth. As well as the goal to get to about 5.6 times levered by the end of the year. Can we expect a similar pace of equity issuance throughout the year? Or does the seasonality of your earnings given the second quarter is not often as good as the first quarter, does that change the pace with which you intend to issue the equity and so forth? I was wondering if you could give us some color on how it will flow throughout the year.","Kim Dang ","The seasonality does not impact when we choose to issue the equity. The price may impact when we choose to issue the equity and there may be some other things that impact that, but the seasonality is not a factor that we consider.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Reichman at Simmons. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Mark Reichman","I just wanted to ask a little bit about the Hiland transaction now that you've been working with it for a couple of months and the Double H is into service. What are you seeing in terms of activity in the area? Your expectations for volumes? If you could talk a little bit about Double H, and I know the capacity is 84,000 barrels per day, where that's running and expectations for the rest of the year. And then also just lastly, I think the plans were to spend about $850 million on that asset portfolio. If you could just talk a little bit about your plans there and just really just an update on the deal. ","Dax Sanders","So overall, just a reminder, we closed the deal on February 13th. The integration is mostly complete and going pretty well. Certainly considering the speeds between sign and closing which was pretty tight. The overall -- based on what we've seen thus far since closing up till now and what we're seeing for the remainder of 2015, taking into account feedback from the producers and our customers. The acquisition is performing, and taking in everything into account in line with our expectations, maybe a tiny bit better.","We did have some issues on Double H with the start up. We were delayed several weeks past our anticipated start up, but we believe we're mostly past those and Double H has ramped up and is running nicely. I think one thing on Double H that we mentioned during the time of the deal is that we were running an open season. At the time of the deal, we announced that we had firm contracts for 63,000 barrels a day, or right around 60,000 barrels a day. That open season produced an additional 17,000 barrels per day. So we do have contracts now for 80,000 barrels a day of the 84,000. So Double H has ramped up, and is running very nicely. But again, I think I would summarize and just say it's running consistent what our acquisition economics were, maybe even a little better.","Mark Reichman","So were the volumes -- what were the actual volumes then? Were they at the 80,000 or?","Dax Sanders","The start-up actually -- we were anticipating that the start-up was going to be right around the beginning of February, the start-up actually finished right around February 27th. Right around the end of February, after that, we started ramping up slowly. So we didn\u2019t -- we certainly didn't ramp right up to the 80,000 barrels a day -- some economics, certainly took into account. We never assumed that we were going to get right up to the 84,000 barrels a day. But we've ramped up over time; we're still working on adding the DRA so the volumes have really been all over the place.","Mark Reichman","So what are they now? And then what would you expect them to be once you add the connection to bring the short-haul volumes the system?","Rich Kinder","We expect to have capacity to move the 84,000 barrels a day and we expect the volumes to be very close to that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brandon Blossman, of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Company. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Brandon Blossman ","Let's see, a specific question and then maybe something broader. On NED, is there a structure or is there some regulatory work to be done as far as cost sharing between the LDCs and the merchant generators in that market? And as a follow-up to that, is that something that maybe the outcome is it possible that that is unique and could be used as a template for other markets on a go forward basis?","Tom Martin ","There is a regulatory process underway in New England to really give all the power customers the platform in which they can equally share the cost of transportation capacity and I think that's what's being developed right now. It may involve utility customers potentially carrying some of this for a period of time, and then transitioning to the power customers directly.","Yes, I know, I think it's probably going to manifest itself in a different form than what we've seen in other parts of the country. But in the Southeast, for example, it's probably the same concept where all the power customers are on the same playing field, and the capacity -- the cost of owning capacity is equally valued in the marketplace. And so therefore, the incentive there is to go out and contract for long-term capacity. We think something like that will ultimately be what occurs in New England.","Brandon Blossman","It's certainly interesting to watch, and there's a lot to play for there as far as generating capacity?","Tom Martin","The economics are very compelling, so I think we'll figure it out.","Brandon Blossman","Certainly, right now in spades, Secondarily, bit picture, and this is another way into the M&A question ultimately, but obviously rate count is down, the folks are getting more comfortable with at least to the thought that we're going to hit the pause button on gas liquids and oil production growth over the next call it 12 months or so, does that change in any way how you approach strategically thinking about or ranking M&A either bolt-ons or larger acquisitions over that time period? Or is this just a bump in the road and you guys are looking past that?","Rich Kinder","Well I wouldn't call it a bump in the road, but certainly we take a long-term view when we enter into discussions on any kind of acquisition. And certainly, we think, there are still opportunities out there and we're going to look at them. You've got to be opportunistic, as Dax laid out some of the criteria earlier. But we don't think this is a retardant to the potential of acquisitions. The real retarding factor to acquisitions right now is that there's just a lot of very cheap money flowing into the energy segment, particularly in the upstream area, that are backing companies that otherwise might be more in need of selling midstream assets that we would be interested in, if they didn't have some of this capital flowing into their operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Darren Horowitz","Two quick questions for me; the first, Steve, back to your comments on UMTP, I'm just curious what the revised offering to accommodate like you mentioned a batch system versus just an outright y-grade system. How are you guys thinking about the variance between maybe the targeted tariffs or expected returns on batch movements relative to contract durations? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- now with the lower cost to capital, what kind of volume and margin blend do you need from a binding commitment perspective to get this into backlog? And more importantly, has anything changed? I think initial proposed scale was like 375,000 barrels a day.","Steve Kean","Yes, I think first of all, I don't think we've got a -- it all depends on how the contracts shake out. How much people are willing to pay, how much the market will bear. That, in turn, tells us how much of the volume that we need to get signed up. Look, the producers up there are struggling with this changing commodity price environment. I think the advantage of switching over to this model and what is attracting some interest is we're maybe not competing with local fractionation any longer. We have the ability to take purity products, and batch purity products through the pipeline, and that\u2019s I think a superior offer.","Just having options generally and the ability to switch around on what you're deliveries are going to be is going to be more valuable to producers than saying, hey, you've got to just put y-grade in here, and you've got to commit to downstream fracks, and then you've got to commit to something after that. So again, we think it's a more attractive offering. We're battling people stepping back a little bit with lower commodity price environment. But we're getting interest with this, and we'll keep pushing at it. We haven't looked to lower our return thresholds on this project, notwithstanding the post-consolidation world. We're going to look, as we do in all cases, to get what we think the full-market value is or fully priced value for our services. So I wouldn't say that our return criteria have changed, and again, I think what price and what volume it takes to get this project on the backlog is really still to be determined.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. And then last question for me, not to beat this thing to death. But I'm curious around NED. And you guys outlined some of this in the release, but if you look at the current discussions with the electric distribution companies, the potential for more power plants, et cetera, and others that you're in discussions with. From an aggregated capacity commitment perspective, what do need to get in addition to the 550 that you've locked down to move this officially to backlog?","Tom Martin","I don't know that I can give you specific number. All I can really say is that we're moving very close -- we're getting a lot closer. And I think we'll have a lot more clarity as we get through the end of the summer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Ted Durbin ","I\u2019m going to stick with NED and ask it in a different way here. Have you thought about splitting the project at all to where you would move forward with the supply portion ahead of doing the demand side, or does it still feel like it needs to be an integrated project?","Tom Martin ","It's really not an integrated project right now. We\u2019re looking at them both separately. And if we get adequate commitment levels on the supply product to move forward, we\u2019ll do that. And that\u2019s developing well as well. I think the timeline is similar. We may have more clarity on the supply project sooner than the market, but I think both are looking more clear as we [technical difficulty] summer.","Ted Durbin ","And how is your capital cost breaking down between the two, is it 50-50ish, or?","Rich Kinder ","It\u2019s about two-thirds market and one-third supply.","Ted Durbin ","And then if we can come back to the CO2 transportation side of things. I guess I\u2019m wondering we took a lot of the backlog this quarter. What is it? Is it a certain oil price or a certain volume ramp up that you need in say the Permian in which these projects come back into the money? I\u2019m just trying to the sense of where the market needs to go for you to say, these will come back into backlog in your customer\u2019s [minds].","Steve Kean ","I\u2019ll start, and let Jesse Arenivas finish or clarify the answer. But I think this is a function of CO2 demand, which in turn is function of the use of CO2 either in grading quantities or existing floods or in new floods being added. And so what you have to ask I think is what\u2019s economic in terms of CO2 flooding on the EOR side. And clearly, existing CO2 floods and maybe even a little incremental demand possibly in an existing flood, that\u2019s economic. But people are going to be hesitant in the current commodity price environment to make the up-front capital commitment that would be required to add new CO2 floods. And that\u2019s really what would drive a lot of additional demand. ","We believe that the demand that we can see for the next few years at least is demand that we can serve with our existing Southwest Colorado production and Cortez pipeline, plus an expansion of really of each of those that are underway, and we think that will take care of it. ","So that\u2019s a long way of saying, I think what is required is incremental demand for CO2 probably represented by new CO2 floods. Which probably need a commodity price change to make it happen?","Jesse Arenivas ","Yes, I think its right, Steve. I think you\u2019ve covered it. You\u2019re probably looking at -- to answer your question on would include price and new economic decisions are probably [viewed] by $80 to $85 WTI.","Ted Durbin ","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And this last one, you talked about the 20% decrease on the CO2 side. Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing outside of that on potential cost savings, whether it\u2019s operating or capital cost savings, just even the deflationary environment we\u2019re in?","Rich Kinder ","You mean outside of the CO2 segment?","Ted Durbin ","Yes","Rich Kinder ","I think we\u2019re seeing some things. But so much of our activity -- a lot of the projects are on the Houston ship channel area, the Gulf Coast where there is a tremendous demand for infrastructure all the way from LNG facilities, to petrochemical plants, to additional terminaling activities along the ship channel. And then big investments, both in our rail terminal with Imperial and this new major merchant terminal up in Edmonton, which is becoming a real hub up there, given the volatility of oil prices, et cetera. Those are two areas where the demand for the kind of services we need are still pretty high. ","So I think you would not expect to see a lot of improvement there. Some other areas we are, and then particularly, as you recall, we targeted 15% savings in our CO2 segment. Jesse and his team are now on that targeting something 20% or a hair better. So we\u2019re making real progress there, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen major changes outside of that upstream CO2 area.","Steve Kean ","Fuel costs. Fuel costs are improved, and that\u2019s the main thing. ","Jesse Arenivas ","We may still see it, but we haven\u2019t -- it hasn\u2019t come through in a big way yet because there again continues to still be a fair amount of demand for the pipeline investments that we\u2019re involved in and competing for.","Ted Durbin ","Okay, great. Very helpful. Thanks. I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Carl Kirst at BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Carl Kirst ","If I could just go back to NED for one second just to make sure I\u2019m understanding. Is the main process still live and is that outside of essentially the broader regulatory process that\u2019s going on in New England?","Tom Martin ","Yes, I think they\u2019ve got a path that\u2019s closer to closure I think than the rest of the New England regulatory process. So I think it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll see a decision there late summer or maybe early fall. And I think the rest of the process will probably be more in the fall.","Carl Kirst","Because I think we had originally thought maybe that might be happening maybe at the end of last year, I think even it might be this springtime. And is that just a matter of these things just take longer because of red tape involved, or has there been an issue that has come up to be aware of?","Tom Martin","I wouldn't say it's an issue, I think it's taken longer. They're continuing to study what their need is, and the process they want to be somewhat coordinated with the rest of the states and don't want to get too far out of front. So I think that has what's led more towards a latter summer time frame for them.","Carl Kirst","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And the maybe, second question if I could, and, Steve you said this is on Trans Mountain. And trying to think about the First Nations for a second and I guess we're around seven to eight bands right out of the 24 core. And is it still your expectation or perhaps belief that we can get to a majority of the First Nations on-side, or is that still being viewed as almost a prereq to get NEB approval or can you get that approval, do you think if you don't get any more bands to sign on?","Steve Kean","A couple things, Carl. One is that; yeah, I think we still expect that we're going to get a majority. But just as important, the standard that we are held to, and really it's a standard that the federal officials -- the federal government is held to that we discharge for them by engaging in it, is consultation and reasonable accommodation. And we will absolutely do that, even if we can't get someone to sign an agreement saying they support the project. In other words, we will -- we've engaged everybody. Frankly, there are handful of bands, coastal bands, some of which who have refused to engage, but it's not something that we have failed to do. We've engaged with everybody, consulted with them. We will accommodate and consult; we will meet our statutory standard. What would like though is to get further than that and actually get mutual benefit agreements which require support of the project signed with a majority of the core, and we still think we'll do that.","But so you have to think in terms of what is the real obligation that we have, and are we going to fulfill that, and the answer to that is yes. And then he further is how much better can we do?","Can we get actually the support and agreement of the majority of the core, and that's certainly what we're aiming for. And we still think we're going to get it.","Carl Kirst","And that ball is still advancing. Okay, all right. Perfect. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Go ahead sir, your line is open. ","Craig Shere","Congratulations on a much simpler reporting structure now.","Rich Kinder","That's correct.","Craig Shere","So in line with thinking about apples-to-apples comparisons, the backlog inventory maybe getting a little confusing from before the MLP roll-ups as we think about including acquisition related CapEx that was significant to the economics of that. And now capitalized overhead. Can you all give a range of maybe what incremental undisclosed growth CapEx you think is needed to roughly underscore that 10% CAGR at this point through the end of the decade?","Steve Kean","I'll answer the question on the backlog first. We included -- we did a high probability share of the Hiland backlog, and included that in the project backlog because that is future capital expense that we'll be incurring to build those projects. We did it similarly when we did APT, and also when we did Copano. So that's not really a change. The overhead thing, look, apologize for the noise here and we won't do this again. But we just needed to get things on common terms. The way we describe projects, the way we make investment decisions, and the way we represent them in the backlog.","And so now we're there. We'll do that that way consistently going forward. And we do expect with a combination of -- that a combination of acquisitions and additional capital beyond what's in the backlog will be required in order to meet that 10% growth. And that has been true really since we announced the role up transaction. And we still believe we're going to get it in sufficient amount to make it.","What we have done with the backlog is really try to show you the stuff that we think of as high probability. We had the noise with the CO2 new source development coming out, but we try to show you the high probability. We don't show you everything that we think will ultimately get done or ultimately make high probability, but we do take that into account when we're putting our outlook together.","Rich Kinder ","And as we look at that outlook, we feel very comfortable that we will have the capital expenditure opportunities necessary to drive that 10% growth. Plus, [indiscernible] the middle thing here that you just can't say too much is that notwithstanding this tremendous drop in commodity prices, the Kinder Morgan game plan is still on track. We still expect to be able to grow the dividend by 10% per year off of this $2 base, and to be able to have substantial excess coverage on top of that. And we aren't seeing anything that would degrade that outlook at this point.","I think the proof of it is the numbers that Kim gave you for how much excess coverage even in these tumultuous times we expect to have. And all that's a function of the footprint the quality of the assets, and the fact that overwhelmingly we're a toll road, a fee-based business, and that gives us just a lot of heft and advantage in this kind of environment.","Craig Shere","Understood. A quick question on the UMTP moving to a batch product opportunity. If that does go off, and that would be great if you're able to finalize that, but does that reduce some of the further downstream maybe fractionation opportunities if you start moving depending on the amount of pure product?","Steve Kean","That would be right. If we're moving purity product, then it would require less fractionation capacity to be subscribed and built in Mont Belvieu or in Houston, in the greater Houston area. Again, we don't how much that mix will be. So what we're talking to market about right now, ethane is not a purity product that we would be batching. But otherwise propane, the butanes, natural gasoline, condensate and the y-grade. We are out there talking to customers about the ability to batch each of those products. And as you point out, depending on what the mix is of demand for y-grade versus the purity products will determine how much additional downstream fractionation capacity would need be to be built.","Craig Shere","And that was always intended to be kind of all in one service offering to some degree right?","Steve Kean","Well what we had -- we had an arrangement with one of the fractionation operators in the Mont Belvieu area to provide that service, and potentially participate in providing that service with them. But that was always I think looked at as an add-on if it came about. So it's separate and apart from what the UMTP conversion project itself is.","Craig Shere","Okay. So the underlying economics wasn't relying on that in any way, including the cost of the --","Rich Kinder","Absolutely not. The pipeline always stood on its own two feet, and we never -- we always considered any fractionation or other downstream opportunities as add-ons that would stand on their own two feet.","Craig Shere","Great. And last question on EOR, any update on when or what it's going to take for Katz and Goldsmith to get on their original trajectory plan? And Yates continues to decline. Any further thoughts on the NGL flood there?","Jesse Arenivas","I think first on Goldsmith and Katz, I think we understand the issues on conformance that we've got plans in place to take corrective action on those. 15 will be below plan, once you get the conformance issues resolved, it's going to take six to eight months to do that, the production come forward. So I think we've got it identified and have a plan in place for those. On the hydrocarbon admissible, it's still very early. We're evaluating the preliminary results and looking at the broader group, so not firm update there but it\u2019s still in its early phases.","Rich Kinder","I think the important thing here is that we -- our people believe that the oil is still there. The oil in place is still there, it's just a question of getting it out. And if you recall, on Katz specifically, back when we started we said we would eventually peak at around 6,000 to 7,000 barrels a day. And notwithstanding we're under plan right now, we're well above last year and we're up to about 4,000 barrels a day now. And believe that will ramp up considerably between now and the end of the year. But we do not believe it will hit the plan.","Now the other side of the coin is that SACROC is having enormous success, up 13% year-over-year, and that's allowing us to be very comfortable with our overall volume picture. Even versus plan. But we are working on Katz and Goldsmith to improve the production there.","Craig Shere","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","John Edwards","Nice numbers here again. If you could update us on the CapEx spend for the first quarter relative to -- what it is, I just couldn't find in the release. And then what is relative to budget. And then just the second question is, are you guys still affirming the 10% dividend growth through the end of the decade?","Rich Kinder ","Well I'll answer the last question, and then I'll have Kim answer the tougher question to reconcile the CapEx for you. But the answer is emphatically yes. We are still affirming our target of $2 this year, 10% growth compound out through 2020 and in case any of you don't have your HP12 in front of you, that's $3.22 in 2020 just at that level.","Obviously, we would hope as some of these capital projects and acquisitions come to fruition that we could do better than that, but certainly that's our target and believe that that is certainly attainable. We haven't seen anything that would change our mind on that. And that's with substantial excess coverage on top of that. Now, Kim, on CapEx for the first quarter, I think you said that. Didn't you?","Kim Dang","Yes. So from a cash perspective, we spent about $800 million. Now if you look at the accrual, so it's slightly different. That's going to be closer to $700 million. But more importantly, I think is the numbers for the full year, and so if you remember correctly, our budget was $4.4 billion for the year, and that did not include the Hiland acquisition. So if you included the Hiland acquisition on top of that, we would've been at 7.3 and that's about where we are right now at 7.3. And essentially, what's happened is that we took some projects out in the CO2 segment and then we've had some spending moves a little bit in products. And then we've added to the CapEx as result of Hiland and so we're down about $100 million or so, but it's very close to budget.","John Edwards","Okay, great. That's helpful. That's all I had. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Christine Cho","Just a broader question on M&A, the conversations that you've had with potential sellers in the last couple of months, how important is it to them to receive cash versus the stock of any potential buyer?","Rich Kinder","I don't think we've seen any preference one way or another. You would think that under certain circumstances some of the potential acquirees would want cash to strengthen their balance sheet for other opportunities. But I don't think we've seen a drastic preference one way or another. Dax?","Dax Sanders","No, I think every situation is different. I wouldn't call a dependency on way or the other. Every situation is different depending upon, as Rich said, liquidity needs also, tax comes into play sometimes on whether somebody wants carryover basis or how adamant they are about that, what their tax basis is. But there's not any -- I wouldn't say that there's any sort of trend one way or the other.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then when I think about with your credit metrics, it would be I would think a little difficult to raise cash through debt for you guys. So how do you think about funding any transaction if the buyer wants cash? With something like Hiland, it was obviously easy enough to do that through your ATM program. But would you be more inclined to do those sized sorts of deals or where you can lean on your ATM program with no problems? Or are bigger size deals on the table even though it might require a sizable overnight offering?","Kim Dang","I don't think that -- if we have an acquisition that we think is accretive and as a good strategic transaction, I don't think that funding that transaction is going to be an impediment to getting it done.","Christine Cho","Okay and then your comments about batching the UMTP line. Is the increased interest in batching because the producers are already committed to fractionation up there, and so they don't want to commit to fractionation in the Gulf Coast? Or is it because producers have already committed their ethane and maybe some of their propane to other projects?","Steve Kean","I think it's more -- my sense of it is that it's more that they just like the idea of having the flexibility. Because they don't know precisely what the future holds for them.","Rich Kinder","I think that's right, Steve. And then the optionality gives them a chance to extract more value out of their projects, it makes them more interested shippers. So I think it's a great option for the producers and shippers to get the most out of their product.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then last question, if you keep TGP in gas service, how much capacity would you be able to offer from north to south service? And I would think that producers would be very interested in that capacity, so are they pushing you for a timeline?","Steve Kean","I'll start and Tom can finish. It's not as big as our back haul projects have been to date. So it's maybe a couple hundred million a day. And it would take CapEx to get that all the way south. And so this is not like, hey, we can just hold an open season tomorrow and for $0.50 or something we can move it south. It would really take some CapEx, and it would take a relatively significant [indiscernible] to justify it. But the production up there is still growing, and if -- we would prefer to do UMTP because it could allow us to deploy more capital at a very attractive return. This is really just an option that we continue to have if customers are not ready for UMTP. But you can't think of it as just it's an easy back haul, it would require some CapEx and some customer sign-up to justify it.","Christine Cho","When do you guys expect to make a decision on UMTP?","Steve Kean","It's been a rolling three months, but we have structured our development activity in such a way that our spend there is manageable. And so we don\u2019t have a specific time frame that I would give you right now.","Christine Cho ","Well, I guess to get it into service by \u201818, when would you have to make a decision?","Steve Kean ","Oh, I see.","Jesse Arenivas ","We would like to have an open season mid-year this year. Now the complication there is we have to have agreements with what you\u2019re shippers want, what\u2019s the source, what products, how would they batch, and so those discussions are going on now. And depending on how they go, we\u2019ll schedule an open season as quickly.","Tom Martin ","And you remember, of course, the conversion process we filed and it takes about a year, so we would expect the first quarter of next year before we have the FERC approval. But in the meantime, we\u2019d like to do the open season, which we\u2019ll probably launch in the second quarter and actually pin down the shipper interest which has been considerable. But again, we are a very conservative company, and until we have signatures on the dotted line we\u2019re not going to commit to build a project or put it in our backlog.","Christine Cho ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time","Rich Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you very much. Again, we think we had a strong first quarter. We look forward to a good year, and we appreciate your attention today. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

All lines have been placed in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Kim. Before we begin, as usual, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call include forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Exchange Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of KMI\u2019s and KML\u2019s earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","As I usually do before turning the call over to Steve Kean and the team, let me make a few comments regarding our long-term strategy and financial philosophy. I have talked repeatedly about our ability to generate large amounts of cash and to use that cash to benefit our shareholders in a number of ways, through reinvesting it in expansion projects to grow our future cash flow; paying dividends; delevering our balance sheet and buying back shares. We are utilizing our cash in all these ways, and this past quarter demonstrates that.","In many respects, because a fine job done by Steve Kean and the whole KMI team, the third quarter was in my view, a pivotal one for the Company. Beyond good operational and financial performance, we have substantially improved our balance sheet extricated ourselves on favorable financial terms from the Trans Mountain expansion that was problematic in view unrelenting opposition from the government of British Columbia, and we have developed additional significant expansion projects which should allow us to continue to grow our cash flow in the future.","Regarding our growth prospects, I believe we can develop good higher return infrastructure projects in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion per year. In short, we are demonstrating that we can generate strong and growing cash flow and employ that cash and benefit our shareholders. That is the essence of our long-term financial strategy at Kinder Morgan. And like many of you on this call, I\u2019m puzzled and frustrated that our stock price does not reflect our progress and future outlook, but I do believe that in the long term, markets are rational and that the true value of our strong cash generating assets will be appropriately valued.","And with that I will turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Thank you. As usual, we will be covering both KMI and KML on this afternoon\u2019s call. I\u2019m going to start with a high level update and outlook on KMI, then turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give you the update on segment performance. David Michels, KMI CFO will take you through the numbers. Then, I will give you a high level update on KML and will take you through the numbers and a couple of other topics there. Then, we will answer your questions on both companies.","We had a pivotal quarter on KMI and KML, highlighted by the closing early in our schedule of our transaction to sell the Trans Mountain pipeline with government of Canada, which removed considerable uncertainty, while providing significant value to KML and KMI shareholders. With respect to KMI, we are having a very strong year. We are well above plan for the first three quarters and now project that we will exceed our financial targets for full-year 2018. And I think that includes our EBITDA, DCF, and our leverage metric targets. We expect to achieve this outperformance, notwithstanding the absence of earnings contribution from Trans Mountain, the delay in the completion of Elba, and the termination of a contract in our Gulf LNG joint venture, none of which was assumed when we put the budget together.","What that tells you is that our underlying business is very strong. We also made our final investment decision along with our partner EagleClaw on the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline project in the third quarter. We have now sold out all of the available capacity to Bcf a day under long-term contracts, as we projected when we FID project. We have also already secured our pipe supply, which is a big mitigation of risk in the current trade environment. We revised our debt to EBITDA target down from 5.0 to approximately 4.5 times with the KML announcement regarding use of proceeds and KMI\u2019s announcement that we will apply KMI share approximately $2 billion U.S. to debt reduction. We are achieving our leverage target.","We\u2019re having a very good year, strong financial performance, tremendous progress in the balance sheet, we\u2019re finding good opportunities to deploy capital on attractive project on our great network of assets. This has been a pivotal quarter for KMI.","Looking ahead, here are priorities: Complete the distribution of the Trans Mountain proceeds and continue our discussions on turning to positive indications that we now have from all three rating agency into positive ratings actions; continue executing on our project backlog, particularly the completion of Elba and the advancement of our Gulf Coast Express and PHP; continue maximizing the benefit of our unparalleled gas network, seek to add attractive return projects to our backlog as we did this quarter with the condition of PHP; continue returning value to our shareholders with a growing and well-covered dividend.","And with respect to questions on KML and possible transaction there. As we\u2019ve said previously, following the sale of Trans Mountain, KML is evaluating all options to maximize value to its shareholders. The original purpose of KML was to hold a strong set of midstream assets and to use the cash flows from those assets and the balance sheet to provide a self funding mechanism for the Trans Mountain expansion. Clearly that purpose no longer exists. The good news for KML shareholders is that there are good options available, which include continuing to operate that strong set of remaining midstream assets as a standalone enterprise. Simply put, we like the assets and we don\u2019t have to sell them. But, among the other potential outcomes is a strategic combination with another company including possibly KMI. We will be exploring and evaluating all of the available options with KML board in the coming months. Because strategic transactions are difficult to forecast, we will likely not have further updates on this until we have something more definitive to say. But as we\u2019ve consistently demonstrated, our focus will be on maximizing KML shareholder value.","The possibility, though not a certainty that KML may enter into a strategic transaction including an outright sale, means that KMI can have another use of proceeds decision. A few points on that. We have consistently said at KMI that we would evaluate the use of available cash to fund attractive projects, return value to KMI shareholders in the form of buybacks or increasing dividend. We\u2019ve also updated our leverage target to around 4.5 times and we\u2019re there now with the Trans Mountain transaction.","With our leverage target achieved, we would expect to use the additional available cash to fund the equity portion of attractive growth projects that we may add to the backlog or for share repurchases. And I\u2019ll say again that we continue to believe that our current share price is an attractive value for share repurchases.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Thanks, Steve. Overall, our segments had a good third quarter, up 5%. Natural gas had an outstanding quarter, it was up 9%. And so, I think it\u2019s worth spending a moment on the overall market. Current estimates show that the overall U.S. natural gas market is going to approach 90 Bcf for 2018, which is over 10% growth versus 2017. This is driving nice results on our large diameter pipes where transfer volumes are up 4 Bcf a day, that\u2019s 14%. If you look at power demand on our system, it was up in the quarter up 1 Bcf or 16%; in the overall power market, natural gas now comprises approximately 38% of total generation, up from 36% in the third quarter of 2017.","Exports to Mexico were up 375 million cubic feet a day on our pipes or 13% versus the third quarter of 2017 with total exports to Mexico on our system of just under 3.3 Bcf a day. Overall, the higher utilization of our systems, a lot of which came without the need to spend significant capital, resulted in nice bottom-line growth in the quarter and longer term will drive expansion opportunities as our pipes reach capacity.","On the supply side, we\u2019re also seeing nice volume growth. Our gas and crude gathering volumes were up 15% -- were up 20%, sorry, and 15%, respectively, driven by higher production in the Bakken and the Haynesville and the Eagle Fort. In the Haynesville, our gathering volumes doubled in the quarter versus 2017.","On the project side in natural gas, we had a few noteworthy developments. Steve gave you the update on PHP. On Gulf Coast Express, we\u2019ve secured approximately 80% of the right away. Construction is starting this month and we remain on target for October 2019 in service.","Our Elba Liquefaction Project, we now anticipate that it will be in service in the first quarter of 2019. Although the delay is impacting our DCF versus budget, the natural gas segment is still expected to exceed its budget for the year. And we do not expect the delay to have a material impact on our construction costs, given the way our construction and commercial contracts are structured.","Our CO2 segment benefited from higher crude and NGL volumes and also higher NGL and CO2 prices. Net crude oil production was up 2% versus the second quarter of 2017. SACROC volumes were up 4% versus last year and they\u2019re 6% above our plan year-to-date, as we continue find ways to extend the life of this deal. Currently, we\u2019re evaluating transition zone opportunities as well as off-unit opportunities that are adjacent to SACROC. Tall Cotton volumes were up versus last year but they\u2019re below our budget. Our net realized crude price is relatively flat for the quarter, despite a higher WTI price. The WTI hedges we have in place as well as the increase in the Mid-Cush differential offset the increase in WTI. For the balance of this year and for 2019, we\u2019ve substantially hedged the Mid-Cush differential.","Our terminals business, we benefited from liquids expansions in Huston Ship Channel, in Edmonton and the new Jones Act tankers that came on in 2017 that we\u2019re getting a full-year benefit in 2018. These benefits were largely offset by weakness in the Northeast, particularly at our Staten Island facility that is now subject to New York spill tax, making facilities in New Jersey more economic options for our customers, and a number of other factors which include non-core asset divestitures, contract expirations at our Edmonton rail facility, and higher fuel and labor costs in our steel business.","Bulk tonnage in the quarter was actually up 5%, primarily driven by coal and pet coke. Although you don\u2019t see much benefit in this result, given the way our contracts are structured, the GAAP revenue recognition rules and to a lesser extent, some pricing changes. Liquids utilization was down 2%, primarily due tanks out of service for API inspections and the Staten Island facility, I mentioned a moment ago.","In the products segment, we benefited from increased contributions from Cochin and Double H, but that was offset by somewhat lower contribution from Pacific due to higher operating costs. Crude and condensate volumes were up 13%, and that was due to increased volumes on our pipelines in the Bakken which drove higher contributions from Double H, and in the Eagle Ford, the impact at those volumes though is largely offset by lower pricing.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David Michels, our CFO, to go through the numbers.","David Michels","All right. Thanks, Kim.","Today, we\u2019re declaring a dividend of $0.20 per share, which is consistent with our 2018 budget and with the plan that we laid out for investors in July 2017. Net annualized $0.80 per share is what we expect to declare for the full-year of 2018 and would represent a 60% increase, $0.50 per share that we declared in 2017. Once again, despite that very robust dividend increase, we expect to generate distributable cash flow of more than 2.5 times our dividend level.","As you\u2019ve already heard Kim, I had another great quarter. Our performance was above budget and above last year\u2019s third quarter. As Steve mentioned, we expect to beat our budget on a full year basis, with all DCF, EBITDA and leverage. ","Now, I\u2019ll walk through the GAAP financials, distributable cash flow and the balance sheet. Earnings, on the earnings page, revenues are up $236 million or 7% from the third quarter of 2017. Operating costs are down $453 million or 18%. However, that does include the gain recorded on the Trans Mountain sale. Excluding certain items, which Trans Mountain is the largest, operating cost would actually be up $162 million or 7%, which is consistent with the growth in revenues. Net income for the quarter is $693 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase; $359 million, $0.16 per share versus the third quarter of 2017. Much of that increase is also attributable to the gain from the Trans Mountain sale.","Looking at earnings on an adjusted basis, looking at adjusted earnings, take out certain items. The $693 million would be $469 million, which is $141 million, a 43% higher in adjusted earnings in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share is $0.21 or $0.06 higher than the prior period.","Moving on to distributable cash flow DCF. DCF per share is $0.49, which is $0.02 up from the third quarter of 2017, 4% increase. That is yet another very nice quarterly performance for 2018 and was strong growth in our natural gas segment. Natural gas was up $81 million or 9% that benefited -- that segment benefited on multiple fronts. You\u2019ve already heard Haynesville, Eagle Ford and Bakken shale volumes were up and that benefited KinderHawk, South Texas and Hiland gathering and processing assets.","Our EPNG and NGPL pipelines had greater contributions, driven from Permian supply growth. Our Tennessee Gas Pipeline was up due to expansion projects which were placed in service. And our CIG pipeline experienced strong growth due to greater DJ basin production. Partially offsetting those items was lower contribution from our Gulf LNG due to a contract termination.","CO2 segment was up $16 million from last year, driven by NGL prices and greater volumes. Kinder Morgan Canada segment was down $18 million or 36% due to the sales of Trans Mountain and a loss of one month of contracts during the quarter.","G&A is lower by $16 million, and that\u2019s due to greater capitalized overhead as well as lower G&A from the Trans Mountain sale.","Interest expense is $10 million higher, driven by higher interest rates which will offset the benefit from a lower debt balance as well as some interest income that we earned on the sale proceeds. Sustaining capital was $36 million higher versus 2017. We have budgeted sustaining CapEx in 2018, it would be higher than 2017 and actually expect and favorable to our budget. So, to summarize, the segments were up $59 million; G&A costs were down $16 million; interest was 8 to $10 million. Cash taxes were $5 million. Other items driven by increased pension contribution for a reduction to DCF is $9 million and sustaining CapEx was higher by $38 million. That adds up to $43 million, which explains the main variances in the $38 million period-over-period change in DCF. ","2018 remains on track to be a very good year for Kinder Morgan. We expect to exceed our budgeted of financial targets for a year, driven by natural gas and CO2 segments, lower G&A, cash taxes and sustaining capital expenditures, partially offset by reduced contributions from Kinder Morgan Canada as a result of the Trans Mountain sale, as well as lower contributions from our terminal segment due to lower lease capacity in the northeast and lower than expected Gulf throughput.","One more note here. While natural gas is nicely ahead of plan year-to-date, as expected to finish the year ahead of plan, the segment does expect to be impacted relative to budget in the fourth quarter by the delayed in service of our Elba and LNG project as Steve Kean mentioned.","Moving on to the balance sheet. We expect -- we ended the quarter at 4.6 times net debt to EBITDA. Just to repeat that, we expect -- we ended the quarter at 4.6 times, net debt to EBITDA. So very important milestone and nice improvement from the 4.9 times last quarter and 5.1 times at year-end 2017.","Our current forecast also has this pending year at 4.6 times. The Trans Mountain sale was the largest driver of that improvement. The proceeds of that sale, they\u2019ll reside at KML. We expect that the distribution of those proceeds will occur in January 2019, January 3, 2019, and we expect to use our share to pay down debt.","In the meantime, KMI consolidates all of those cash proceeds including the amount that the public KML shareholders will receive. Therefore, as you can see on the balance sheet page, we subtract it out from KMI\u2019s net debt, approximately $919 million of cash that will go to the KML public shareholders. We believe that\u2019s a more accurate reflection of KMI\u2019s leverage. Including that adjustment, net debt ended the quarter at $34.5 billion, a decrease of $2.1 billion from year-end and from last quarter. So, to reconcile that 2.1 for the quarter, we generated $1.093 billion of distributable cash flow. We had growth capital and contributions to JVs of $715 million. We paid dividends of $444 million. We received the Trans Mountain sale proceeds of $3.391 billion. We took out the KML public shareholders portion of those proceeds of 919. And we had a working capital use of $337 million, primarily as a result of EPNG refund payments. And that reconciles to our $2.069 million reduction in net debt for the quarter. ","For the full-year or year-to-date, reconcile -- reconciliation, we generated $3.457 billion of distributable cash flow. We had growth CapEx and contributions to JVs of 1.981 billion. We paid dividends of $1.163 billion. We repurchased $250 million of shares. And we received the Trans Mountain sale proceeds of 3.391. We excluded the KML public shareholders portion of that at $919 million. And we had a working capital use of $455 million year-to-date that also includes the EPNG refunds, as well as the interest payments, and that reconciles to the $2.08 billion reduction in net debt year-to-date.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Thanks. So, we close the transaction on -- talking about KML, turning to KML now. We closed the Trans Mountain transaction. As we said at the time of close, the sales price amounts to about $11.40 Canadian per KML share. And on top of that, KML\u2019s shareholders have a strong set of remaining midstream assets in an entity with little or no debt and with opportunity for investment expansion, as well as the potential for a strategic combination. We have a shareholder vote coming up on November 29th on a couple of matters that Dax will take you through, and expect the distribution of proceeds to occur in January, as David mentioned. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to our CSO, Dax Sanders.","Dax Sanders","Thanks, Steve.","Before I get into the results, I do want to update you on a couple of general items. First, as both Steve in the press release mentioned, we anticipate distributing the net proceeds associated with the sale on January 3, 2019, following shareholder vote on November 29th. More on the amount to be distributed in a second. Specifically, the shareholder vote is to approve two things. First, a reduction in stated capital, which is in Alberta corporate law concept. And with the reduction in stated capital, we will ensure that our distribution is copacetic with Alberta corporate law. The overall concept of the stated capital reduction is more fully described in the proxy. Second approval is to affect the three-for-one reverse split, post payment of special demand. As a reminder, the vote is subject to a two thirds majority of the outstanding shareholders in KMI, which owns approximately 70% has agreed about in favor.","Moving to the business front. We now have all 12 Base Line tanks in service as we place 5 of the 6 remaining tanks in service during Q3 and the last tank in service just after the quarter-end. Overall, 10 of the 12 tanks were placed into service on-time or early. As of the end of Q3, we have spent approximately $342 million of our share with approximately $31 million remaining on the total spend of approximately $373 million. The $373 million compares with original estimate of $398 million. And as I mentioned last quarter, is a result of cost savings on the project.","Now, going towards results. Today, the KML board declared a dividend for the third quarter of $0.1625 per restricted voting share of $0.65 annualized, which is consistent with previous guidance.","Earnings per restricted voting share for the third quarter of 2018 are $0.05 from continuing operations and 378 from discontinued ops, and both are derived from approximately $1.35 billion of net income, which is up approximately $1.3 billion versus the same quarter in 2017. Obviously, the big driver there was the large gain on the sale of the Trans Mountain pipeline. So, let me focus for a minute on what\u2019s driving the $12.4 million increase in income from continuing operations.","Stronger revenue associated with the Base Line tank and terminal coming online and interest income associated with the proceeds from Trans Mountain sale are the big drivers. Adjusted earnings, which excludes certain items were approximately $44 million compared to approximately $42 million from the same quarter in 2017. Of course, the big certain item in the quarter was the gain on the sale of Trans Mountain.","Total DCF for the quarter which is not adjusted for discontinued ops is $80.6 million, which is up $3.4 million for the comparable period in 2017 and within $1 million of our budget. That provides coverage of approximately $7 million, reflects the DCF payout ratio of approximately 71%.","Looking at the components of the DCF variance. Segment EBITDA before certain items is up $8.4 million compared to Q3 2017 with the pipeline segment up approximately $8.2 million and the terminal segment essentially flat. The pipeline segment was lower primarily due to the Trans Mountain assets going away and that was approximately $15 million net. It was offset by the non-recurring underlying FX loss from some intercompany notes that were in place in 2017 and lower O&M and Cochin compared to 2017 as we had some non-routine integrity management activities in 2017 that were completed. The terminal segment was essentially flat with the Base Line tank terminal project coming into service and higher contract rates and renewals at the North 40 Terminal and the Edmonton South Terminals offset by the expiration of a contract on the Imperial JV. Same unrealized FX dynamic I mentioned on the pipeline segment and the lease payment on the Edmonton South facility to the government.","G&A is favorable by $2.5 billion, due primarily to the removal of the Trans Mountain G&A term line. Interest is favorable by approximately $11 million due to the interest on the Trans Mountain proceeds and lower interest expense. The cash tax line items is essentially flat. Preferred dividends were up $5.2 million, given Q3 2018 had both tranches outstanding for the fourth quarter. Sustaining capital was favorable approximately $3.8 million compared to 2017 with the exclusion of Trans Mountain being the main driver but augmented by timing of spending in the terminals segment.","Looking forward, as we mentioned in the release, we expect to generate $50 million to $55 million of adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter and almost a full quarter of Base Line tanks in service during the fourth quarter. And also, and consistent with the past practice, as we prepare our 2019 budget for KML, we will communicate that which will provide more color on the earnings power of the residual assets going forward.","With that, I\u2019ll move to the balance sheet comparing year-end 2017 to 9\/30, and my comments will focus only on the line items related to the retained assets and not the assets or liabilities held for sale.","Cash increased approximately $4.239 billion to $4.35 billion, and there are a lot of moving pieces and the change associated with Trans Mountain stemming from the CapEx spend on behalf of government, the government credit facility, and other purchase price adjustments, such that I\u2019m not going to take you through that on this call. But if you want more detail, feel free to give us a call. Generally, the increase is the $4.426 billion of net proceeds received, plus DCF generated less expansion CapEx, less distributions paid net of growth and less the payoff of the debt we have when we receive the sale proceeds.","More importantly, let\u2019s look forward where that cash is going. The dividend we will pay in January and that\u2019s the approximate $11.40 per KML share, will be approximately $4 billion and then we\u2019ll pay capital gains tax associated with the transaction of just over $300 million in Q1 2019. Other current assets increased approximately $19.5 million, primarily due to an increase in several items in accounts receivable with the largest component of that coming from a billing to Imperial related to the Imperial JV.","Net PP&E decreased by $3 million as a result of depreciation in excess of net assets placed in service. Deferred charges and other assets decreased by approximately $64 million, which is a result of a write-off of the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the TM facility that we canceled.","On the right hand side of the balance sheet, other current liabilities increased $321 million, primarily due to the taxes payable on the Trans Mountain sale. Other long-term liabilities decreased by $283 million, primarily as a result of a deferred tax liability release, as a result of the gain on the sale of Trans Mountain. Also of note, we ended the quarter without any outstanding debt.","With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. We\u2019re going to go to Q&A. We\u2019re going to do something slightly different this time. We got some feedback that some of you would prefer that as a courtesy to others with questions, we limit the questions per person to one with one follow-up, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. However, if you have more than one question and a follow-up, we invite you to get back in the queue, and we will come back around to you. Okay. With that, we\u2019ll turn it over -- operator, please come back on and start the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Hi. How should we book in [ph] the potential downside for KMI of the 501-G outcomes? Do you have any internal productions that you can share of what EBITDA lose could be in the worst case?","Steve Kean","Yes. It\u2019s very hard to project, because the outcome is highly uncertain, but I\u2019ll try to give you some parameters. We\u2019ve said in the past that looking at the tax effect alone, it\u2019s about $100 million across our interstate assets. Beyond that it\u2019s very difficult to predict. And you understand -- you know what the mitigating factors are. We have rate moratorium in place on many of our systems. We have negotiated rates for many of our transactions in the interstate business. We have discounted rates in effect. Not all of our gas segment is interstate. Some of it is our intrastate a business in Texas, which we\u2019re obviously growing. And not all of our regulated interstate assets earn their cost of service.","Okay. So, if you put that all together and you roll off several years forward, and you\u2019re really just talking about the max rate revenues on our interest business that are subject to some adjustment. If the max tariff rate comes down, which is what rate actions do, they would be subject to adjustment. And that amounts to about 30%, which by the way, to us anyway underscores the lack of foundation for what the commission is doing here. If you look at the action that they\u2019re taking, they\u2019re treating interstate natural gas pipelines as if they were regulated franchise monopoly utilities. That hasn\u2019t been the case since the 1970s.","Over the last 30 years, the commission has carefully crafted a competitive market through various administrations, one pro competitive rulemaking after another in order to create competition between pipelines. We operate in a competitive market, not in the franchise service territory. We expect to bring that and other rate-making arguments to bear as we go through the 501-G process. So, thanks for giving me a chance to stay on the result.","Kim Dang","And one thing -- one follow-up there. The 30% that you mentioned is just of the interstate revenues, not of the whole gas segment, it is of the interstate.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Yes. That makes sense. And if we start to think about it, maybe as a multiple of the 100 million going away and a worst case or...","Steve Kean","Yes. Again, very hard to project, because I think there are quite a few hands to play here as we work through this process and we work with our customers and we work with our regulator and we actively mitigate it. And I think we will be able to actively mitigate it, spread it over time. And the numbers I gave you are what gives us some confidence in that statement. We\u2019ll be able to mitigate this and spread it over time.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And then, as a follow-up, you mentioned on the last call the potential of re-contracting at higher negotiated rates on EPNG, NGPL, and I believe your intrastate pipe. Could we get an update on that and would you be willing to share roughly what share of your volumes out of the Permian come up for negotiated rate re-contracting over the next couple years?","Steve Kean","Yes. It\u2019s not we have a quantification of that. ","David Michels","Yes. It\u2019s hard to put a number on all of that. I mean, I think we\u2019re talking about $25 million, somewhere in that range kind of year-over-year upside.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Maybe just to follow up on that 501 question. I was just wondering if you can clarify a couple of things. I mean, at this stage right now, can you confirm that that request is effectively informational at this point right now and it\u2019s not actionable? And then, as part of the discussion on it, can you speculate on the purpose of the FERC making this request in the first place? Is it more to find the market price for the ROE, given that the last rate case was so long ago? Especially, given the context that there\u2019s like another filing out there for a pipeline that\u2019s asking for mid-teens ROE. I was just wondering if you can sort of opine on that.","Steve Kean","On the first, we view it as an informational filing. And we view it as frankly, a bad informational filing. There are a number of things that it overlooks, including the negotiated rates and other things that I mentioned. It uses a very old litigated ROE, uses the cap structure that we don\u2019t think is appropriate. And it kind of forces -- it forces information into a particular template that we don\u2019t think is consistent with the way commission -- the commission has done rate making in the past. And so, in the course of all this, we\u2019ll get an opportunity I\u2019m sure to point that out. But, what I would submit that you all ought to be thinking about is, you\u2019re going to get as many of you have written, these numbers are going to be uninformative.","So, as these 501-Gs roll out, you need to take that into account as you\u2019re looking at them, because they have flaws in our view, particularly in light of past commission policy and precedent. So, we think they\u2019re informational and not very much information.","On FERC\u2019s purpose, I won\u2019t speak for them. But, I think it was fairly clear from the process leading up to this that it was based on a desire to make sure that the benefits of the income that the Tax Cuts passed late last year found their way to customers. And in a competitive market, they do find their way, one way or another, to customers. But, we are not again, a franchise -- a protected franchise, regulated monopoly utility in the same way that some electric utilities or gas local distribution companies are. And so, I think that using a similar approach, if you will, with us given our circumstances isn\u2019t appropriate. And we\u2019ll continue to make that point to the commission.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And as a follow-up question. I believe Rich mentioned in his prepared remarks an ability to invest $2 billion to $3 billion a year on an ongoing basis. Where do you envision those dollars being spent? Are we looking at some more large scale projects, like Permian Express Highway, or do you see it more of a series of $100 million to $200 million type projects? And if so, kind of where do you see the capital being spent?","Steve Kean","I think, it\u2019ll be primarily directed to natural gas. We put -- we grew the backlog quarter-to-quarter $200 million after putting several projects in service and that was largely due to a net addition of backlog of $600 million on the natural gas segment. And if you look at the fundamentals that Kim took you through, we would expect to see not only the increased utilization of the existing system but the opportunity to put more capital to work. And we\u2019re looking at what those projects would be. It\u2019s a little hard to say how many big ones will it be versus a collection of smaller multi-hundred million ones. But, we think we\u2019ll have good opportunities there.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi. Good afternoon. Just want to turn to the business a little bit here. And it seems like you have some things kind of moving in your favor as far as growth is concerned, natural gas segment. You noted kind of the Bakken, Haynesville and Eagle Ford, and crude activity there. And just want to touch a bit more on those areas. It seems like the Bakken, there is quite wide basis differentials that cropped up recently there and wondering what that could mean for you guys as far as possibly expanding Double H or other infrastructures you might have. The Haynesville, seems like resurgence of activity there. BP might be looking to do more. Have you been in conversations with guys like that that are putting more capital to work? And then, the Eagle Ford as well seems like kind of coming off the trough nicely. Just wondering if you could comment on those three areas as far as where you see the growth opportunities.","Steve Kean","Jeremy, that feels like a lot more than one question. So, I\u2019m going to -- I think in all three areas that you touched on, I think there is going to be opportunities. I think, we are looking at some -- I don\u2019t want to speak too much on the crude side, but there is -- there are some projects that we\u2019re looking at to take additional volumes south to Cushing. Potentially on the crude side, there is clearly a need for additional residue solution out of the Bakken. So, I think that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re exploring as well. Clearly, there is going to be more expansion capital deployed in the Haynesville as we -- our existing capacity I think will be a point, certainly in pockets of the Haynesville, we\u2019ll need to expand the system to take additional volumes there. And then, the Eagle Ford I think largely will be building our existing capacity, but there may be pockets of opportunity to expand there, particularly on the NGL side, which we\u2019ll take a look at as well. So, I think clearly the value of our capacity, existing capacity is going up to the extent it\u2019s not already sold in long-term contracts. As those deals come up for renewal, we should do better in those areas. So, I think prospects look good.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Great. Thanks for that. I was going to ask about Permian brownfield debottlenecking opportunities. But in the interest of not getting in trouble, I\u2019ll hope back in the queue.","Operator","And your next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Colton Bean","Good afternoon. As you evaluate next steps on KML, is there any consideration of potential asset inclusion from the KMI level, specifically maybe the U.S. portion of Cochin? And I guess, to touch on that, how does that fit into the Kinder network if KML were to exit the portfolio?","Steve Kean","Yes. So, Cochin does not commercially or otherwise really divided the quarter. So, it makes sense for it to end one side or the other. And we\u2019re evaluating how best to handle that. And some of that as a function of who the prospective or possible purchaser candidate might be. So, that\u2019s still to be worked out, but you have put your finger on something that we have to resolve as part of it. It is an attractive asset. It runs full. It\u2019s under contract, nearly full, it runs -- it\u2019s under long-term contract. And it is providing a valuable service to our customers. So, I think it\u2019s valuable, whichever side it gets up on. ","Colton Bean","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And I guess, just as a follow-up. So, you mentioned on UMTP, moving away from that project, I think you had filed for a abandonment on the TGP portion there in 2015. Given the abandonment filing, is there anything incremental, you would need to do on permitting, if you were to pursue a project there? And just any thoughts on kind of commercial appetite for more and more Northeast to Gulf Coast capacity given where spreads move to? ","Steve Kean","Yes. We\u2019re not pursuing that project any further. And we reflected that in our accounting for the quarter et cetera. And part of the reason for that is, we haven\u2019t gotten the customer sign up on UMTP. But just as importantly, we have a lot of interest in that pipe, which is currently in gas service, remaining in gas service and the potential for another long series of reversal projects that we\u2019ve done on TGP in order to take the Marcellus and Utica gas south to where the market is now growing. And so, it\u2019s a function of a lack of opportunity on the one hand, but thankfully the emergence of a very good opportunity on the other.","Colton Bean","Okay. And so, no real, no real downtick in appetite for Southbound capacity even with basis being a bit tighter?","Steve Kean","Yes. For this capacity, which is -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the last one, but it\u2019s among the few remaining opportunities to take existing Northbound capacity and turn it around. So, it\u2019s not brand new Greenfield long haul pipe. So it\u2019s one of the last, if not the last pipeline reversal projects. So, we think if we can -- that it is attractive in this market price. Clearly, it\u2019s attractive compared to Greenfield costs and that it\u2019s a nice pocket of capacity, it doesn\u2019t require Bcf, 2 Bcf of commitment, it\u2019s [indiscernible] range, I think, pretty actionable. So good trade.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","I just wanted to go back something you said earlier, Steve, just around your ability to meet and actually beat guidance here, as we get to the end of the year, despite some of the headwinds and unforeseen, all the issue that you had. Curious if you can just give a little more detail around what exactly is driving your ability to do it? And ultimately, what I\u2019m getting at is, how much of that is really sustainable into 2019 versus maybe just commodity shrink based?","Steve Kean","Yes. It\u2019s really -- I mean, as Kim said, it\u2019s the uptick that we\u2019ve had in natural gas volumes and utilization. And one important point of note there is that the volumes on both the supply and the demand side are growing faster even in Texas. So, we\u2019re seeing that 14% number that were up is 20% -- that\u2019s 20% on sales and that\u2019s 25% on transport in the Texas intrastate market, which is a good thing. That\u2019s not a FERC regulated position for us. So, really, there is good tailwinds there, and they\u2019re expected to continue. And we\u2019ve had growth like we\u2019ve never seen, at least in a very, very long time in the gas markets year-over-year, and we\u2019re going to have another -- it looks like another good year of growth next year on the supply and the demand side. So, that looks like a good, beneficial trend for us, carrying on.","Tom Martin","Again, I would just add that what we\u2019re looking at Kinder Morgan is the largest network of pipes moving natural gas, about 40% of all the natural gas moved on our system. And when you have the kind of dynamics as Steve and Kim are referring to, it\u2019s a huge tailwind for the whole Company. And that\u2019s in essence the guts of what we\u2019re trying to do at Kinder Morgan. And I think, in this year and particularly in this quarter, you\u2019re seeing that tailwind really come to fruition, and it\u2019s really driving tremendously good performance.","Spiro Dounis","I appreciate that. And then, not sure if this is where Jeremy was going, but I\u2019ll pick up that Permian question. In terms of the potential need for a third gas pipe out of there, I think Steve talked about it on the last call, maybe being kind of a tossup between the need to just expand the current pipe or do you add a third one. I think you said it was unclear last time. Just wondering, as you\u2019ve gone through the rest of the Permian Highway process, is that more clear to you now? Do you feel like it\u2019s clear one way or the other that third pipe is needed or do you see yourself getting maybe 2.7 Bcf a day on Permian?","Steve Kean","Yes. So, the 2.7 -- I\u2019ll start with that, 2.7 Bcf on the Permian Highway was if we had gone 48 inch. We went to 42 inch, because the supply chain for the pipe for 42 inch was much more secure, and as Kim said, we locked in our pipe there. And so, we took care of that risk. I think, our view and Tom you elaborate, but I think our view is, you\u2019re going to continue to need additional types out of the Permian over time. We may be at a point where as people are waiting for the takeaway to come on and they\u2019re doing more docks and they\u2019re doing more diversion of rigs at other places, et cetera. They\u2019re taking a brief break in the breakneck growth they were having. But we think there\u2019s a third pipeline, maybe it\u2019s two or three years out as opposed to right now, but we think there\u2019ll be a third pipeline, if not more after that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.","Tristan Richardson","Just curious on opportunities for new infrastructure downstream sort of in anticipation of the 4 Bcf a day of incremental supply from your two large projects as we look into 2020?","Steve Kean","Yes. Well, a very good point. So, if you look at our Texas system today, it\u2019s about a 5 Bcf a day system. And with these two projects that Tom\u2019s team has put together here really in a very short period of time, we\u2019re bringing another 4 Bcf to that system. Now, those projects come with certain downstream lease arrangements or pipeline capacity arrangements on our existing Texas intrastate system. But it will create, we believe, follow-on opportunities for us to do debottlenecking expansions on the Texas system to accommodate all of that additional gas, which comes with a lot of additional demand as LNG comes on and as we continue to see exports to Mexico rise, et cetera. So, the Texas market -- the whole Texas market and our position in it is in very good shape right now and has a very fine outlook.","Tristan Richardson","And then, just a follow-up. Just curious sort of what areas in terms of the additions to backlog outside of PHP, sort of where you\u2019re seeing growth project additions?","Steve Kean","Okay. Well, we touched on one with the Tennessee pipeline reversal. We have additional projects serving LNG coming up that we are looking at on NGPL as well as our Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline. We\u2019ll look at those also on the Texas Gulf Coast as time goes on. In the West, we\u2019ll continue to find I think some debottlenecking opportunities, which may not necessarily have a full bunch of capital, but all that capacity is very valuable, certainly in the near term. And so, we can monetize that.","And then, so the earlier question, the G&P part of our business, the Bakken is moving again and it is bottlenecked on our system. And so, we are investing capital to debottleneck that system and get our customers\u2019 product to market. But, as Tom alluded to, in the Haynesville and in the Eagle Ford, we\u2019ve got room on our existing systems to take additional volume with potentially small debottlenecking, not capital intensive expansion. So, we\u2019ll get some volume, not for free, but for nearly free, as it grows in the Haynesville. And so, more in the Bakken than in the other two basins.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research.","Keith Stanley","On the KML strategic review process, is there any reason you\u2019d want to wait until the Trans Mountain special payment in early January or the shareholder vote in November before you make a decision on KML, or are those two items not connected at all?","Steve Kean","We don\u2019t necessarily have to wait on that for a decision, and we can work our process even starting now.","Keith Stanley","Okay. And one follow-up just on the backlog. You added $800 million in the quarter. How much of that is Permian Highway and what ownership interest are you assuming there?","Steve Kean","Yes. So, we were conservative, I believe, on the ownership interest. So, we took it assuming a full exercise of the options that the large shippers on the system have to take equity. So, isn\u2019t that, Tom, 600, something like that? So, it was most of the addition to the backlog and gas.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley.","Tom Abrams","Thanks. Intrigued with this Bakken residual gas idea, began just coming out of the ground, has to go somewhere, but where? Where does it go? Try to get to the West Coast, we need LNG development there, or you get to the Gulf Coast and fight past all that Permian associated gas, just how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Tom Martin","Yes. I mean, I think we\u2019re considering both options and I think more likely down to the Rockies area, but considering both.","Tom Abrams","And then, on the New York terminaling, you still have some headwinds there on Staten Island. But as you look across in the New Jersey, are you seeing anything over there that would suggest things are tightening up where the wind is kind of getting less in your face and maybe starting to bottom out and improve?","Steve Kean","400% utilized in two New Jersey facilities at Carteret and at Perth Amboy. And actually, we saw an improvement on a quarter-to-quarter basis at Staten Island. We had 948,000 barrels last quarter and we\u2019re up to 1.7 billion now. So, we\u2019ve got a good short-term plan to keep our head above water over there. Spill tax is still a huge issue though. And so, we\u2019re looking at strategic options for the facility kind of long-term, which could include looking at alternatives for the side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Real quick, and it\u2019s a little bit of a two for one. How are you thinking about project returns on Elba Island now versus kind of original expectations? And for Gulf LNG to move forward outside of the FERC EIS process, how should we think about the sequence of steps necessary for that to become something that\u2019s kind of a real project for you guys?","Steve Kean","Okay. First on Elba. So, you have to go way back in time. But, when we originally sanctioned the project, we didn\u2019t have a joint venture partner and we didn\u2019t have certain other things in place. The return has actually improved since that time, and we\u2019re still looking at a double-digit after-tax, unlevered return. Now, part of what brought about that change is we brought in a partner and our investment and it was promoted, our development of it was promoted. The other thing that\u2019s protected us there, Michael, is we have in our contractual arrangements, there is three important parties here. There\u2019s us as the project developer and manager et cetera. There is Shell, who is the provider of the units that are being provided to do the liquefaction. So, that\u2019s not, if you will, on us. That\u2019s something that Shell is providing. And then, we\u2019ve entered into an EPC contract with our EPC contractor. So, the bottom line on all that is it insulates us from some of what you would normally think of as the cost of pain that\u2019s associated with delay. So, our returns have surprisingly eroded, not that much notwithstanding a fairly significant and really not acceptable from our standpoint delay. The second question was on Gulf LNG? Okay.","Michael Lapides","Yes. How do you think about next steps for Gulf LNG outside of the obvious with the FERC EIS process?","Steve Kean","Yes. So, as you have just said, I mean, we did get some information on Gulf LNG, the commission actually gave a timeframe on the EIS and on the expected order date for the 7c, which is in mid-July of next year. Gulf LNG is the last brownfield liquefaction opportunity. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the next wave of LNG. We need to get our current situation resolved with our re-gas shippers who are there and we need to explore our options in the market. And that includes not just marketing the facility; we\u2019re potentially looking at a JV opportunity or other things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Catellier with CIBC Capital Markets.","Robert Catellier","I was just hoping to make sure I understand the Trans Mountain recall rates on some of the tanks at KML if TMX is completed. I understand they have the right to recall tanks. And I think the original expectation was they could recall -- they were likely recall too. So, my question is, is that still the expectation? And what is the impact on EBITDA to KML as a going concern, if that in fact happens?","Steve Kean","Yes. That\u2019s still the expectation. The few tanks are still the expectation at the time that the project actually comes into play. And so, that\u2019s obviously at the time project comes into play. They\u2019ve also got the ability to give two years of additional notice -- two years of notice and recall additional tanks to the extent that they can\u2019t meet their regulated requirements, existing regulated requirements, after they give notice. And so, we don\u2019t anticipate to have that.","Robert Catellier","And the quantification, give us some color on the impact?","Steve Kean","Yes. Go ahead.","Tom Martin","It depends upon what we actually have in terms of third-party business out there. And so, it would depend on the specific situation.","Robert Catellier","Okay. Similar question then on the expiration contracts at the Edmonton rail terminal. I think, there\u2019s an important contract that expires in 2020 with favorable renewal rates for the customer. What sort of color can you provide us on the impact that might have?","Steve Kean","It switches to a cost plus contract. So, we will have a management fee in place at that time. So, we looked at this that it would be paid off in its initial term. And in April of 2020 that contract switches over to just a management contract.","Robert Catellier","So, that\u2019s a material impact then?","Steve Kean","Right now, it looks like it\u2019s about $45 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert Kwan","Hi. Just wanted to confirm, with the numbers Dax gave, both the $4 billion on the dividend and then just over $300 million on the tax, just to make sure there is no other major inflows are outflows that pretty much means you\u2019ve got -- you\u2019re going to be no debt, no cash. Is that fair?","Dax Sanders","Yes. That\u2019s about right. Pro forma for the cash taxes were just over 300 the dividend of about or -- that\u2019s right.","Robert Kwan","Okay. And then just on the $50 million to $55 million in the fourth quarter, so that pretty much includes all of the second phase of baseline, yet that sweeps up the full quarter of the tank lease, at least the rail contract highlighted as part of this quarter. Does it also incorporate what you think the ongoing G&A run rate is, and are there any kind of future factors?","Dax Sanders","No. I think that\u2019s a pretty clean sort of going forward run rate. The last baseline tank came in -- I said, the last one came in the fourth quarter, just after the beginning of the fourth quarter. So, it\u2019s got a pretty, pretty good run rate going forward.","Operator","Our next comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Steve Kean","Hello, again.","Shneur Gershuni","Hey. Following the rules, I had seven questions. I just wanted to clarify something that Kim has said earlier about total interstate revenues and 30% of that with respect to an adverse situation. Just wondering if you can sort of walk us through that again.","Steve Kean","Yes. So, if you think of it this way, if FERC were to make ultimately a rate adjustment, what they would be adjusting down would be our max rate tariff. And so, by definition, it\u2019s primarily the shippers who are paying max rates that if the revenue associated with that that could potentially be affected, could have some reduction in it, not elimination but some reduction in it. And negotiated rates, discounted rates would not be affected, they\u2019re largely not affected. There is always a possibility that max rates come down enough that they get some of the discounts and they pull the rate, the max rate goes below the discounted rate. But, that\u2019s very small. And so, it\u2019s really the potential for an adjustment is a potential for an adjustment to that 30% subset of the interstate regulated revenues, which in turn are a subset of our natural gas segment. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to convey.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. So just to clarify. So, basically what you\u2019re saying is 30% of your revenues -- sorry, 30% is subjective max rate and that\u2019s where you would then see an adjustment. So, if not a 30% hit to the revenues, it would be far less than that?","Steve Kean","Correct. Very important. Yes. And it\u2019s 30% of the regulated interstate revenues that we\u2019re talking about. And yes, so, if you had -- and we\u2019ve had rate settlements where we\u2019ve taken a 5% reduction, for example, or a rate reduction that goes from 1%, then 3%, then 4, something like that. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in other settlements. So, it\u2019s not the whole 30%. Thank you for that clarification. Not the whole 30%.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. Thank you. Much appreciated. And as a second follow-up question. You sort of gave in your opening remarks an update on if you ended up selling Canada where the proceeds would go and so forth. I was just wondering if you can talk about whether it\u2019s a buyer or sellers market in Canada. And then, in terms of thoughts around asset sales, are there any other assets that you\u2019re thinking about selling, for example, the Oklahoma assets where you had an impairment earlier this year. And is it fair to assume a similar playbook in terms of buybacks, if you were to get proceeds on some asset sales elsewhere?","Steve Kean","Yes. First of all, what we were talking about with respect to use of proceeds would apply kind of wherever the proceeds came from. We\u2019d make sure that we maintain that same leverage ratio, but then we would use them. If there were available projects, we\u2019d use them for projects, but otherwise they would go to share buybacks. So, that\u2019s our current thinking. On the KML assets, we think they\u2019re great assets. They are -- it\u2019s a fairly new development. We\u2019ve built the largest merchant terminal position in Edmonton. John and his team did that over a 10 or 12-year period. And the Vancouver Wharves asset is a very good asset, the Cochin Pipeline is a very good asset. And we think that asset packages like this are rare anywhere, but they are rare to come to market and they are rare to come to market in Western Canada. And so, we do think that it tends to be a bit of a seller\u2019s market for these assets.","Shneur Gershuni","The Oklahoma assets or any other assets?","Steve Kean","Yes. So, Oklahoma, as we said, we have good G&P assets. We have some assets that might be more valuable in someone else\u2019s hands and where we find those instances, and Oklahoma may be one of those, we could look to monetize them. But beyond that, not commenting on specific processes or specific assets. Everything here at a price, right, at the right price that -- the whole driver is what\u2019s going to create the most shareholder value. That\u2019s it. And so, if we find those opportunities on pieces of our asset base as we have in the past, some facilities, we\u2019ll certainly evaluate those.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi. So, about that Permian natural gas debottlenecking. I think, in the past, you guys have talked about 2 Bcf a day gross capacity that could be added between kind of Texas intrastate, EPNG and NGPL. And just wanted to drill down if that was more -- you talked about the downstream connectivity that would be employed, I guess with -- based on these new pipes that you are building. 2 Bcf number, is that specific to that or just trying to drill down into really Waha takeaway? Is there any more that you guys can squeeze out on your assets there, given how Waha touched the buck recently and seems like egress is ever more challenged?","Tom Martin","I mean, I think all of the low-hanging fruit has been harvested as far as low cost expansion. And certainly, we\u2019re monetizing all the existing capacity that we have. There is anywhere from a Bcf to 2 Bcf of potential projects to be done at a much higher costs, which really are markets -- are supported by the market today. And if they were deployed, it would be kind of post PHP time horizon. But, we\u2019re certainly looking at those smaller components of those projects that may still make economic sense. And really, the downstream side of it is really what Steve talked about earlier, and that is clearly a lot of the demand for this 4 Bcf is driven by Mexico exports, LNG exports, as well as growth along the Texas Gulf Coast in the petrochemical market. And we will look for opportunities to expand and extend our Texas intrastate network to support those growth activities.","Jeremy Tonet","So, just to be clear, the 1 to 2 Bs that you talk about, that\u2019s really kind of like downstream of a PHP, and kind of that last mile getting to market, that\u2019s not more getting out of Waha. Is that the right way to think about it?","Tom Martin","That\u2019s more Permian.","Jeremy Tonet","But, it is getting out of Waha?","Tom Martin","Yes.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay. But that\u2019s more\u2026","Tom Martin","Permian to Waha or places in North potentially up on the North mainline of El Paso or up into the Rockies via Trans Colorado. But again, I\u2019ve -- those are, again, not for the bigger quantities anyway, probably not supported by market prices today. But, we\u2019re certainly looking at smaller pieces of that, subsets of that as we get those done.","Steve Kean","And the market may support them in the future as Permian continues to grow and the pipe -- even the pipe capacity that\u2019s getting built, gets filled out.","Jeremy Tonet","And then, just a follow-up real quick, and we were talking about Double H before. If you can expand that, how long would that take to do? Is that kind of a pumping thing that could be done within a year or is this kind of longer term projects in nature?","Steve Kean","On Double H?","Jeremy Tonet","Yes.","Steve Kean","Yes. There is a small remaining expansion to be done, that\u2019s pump station.","Tom Martin","That\u2019s right.","Jeremy Tonet","So, I think a couple of quarters, you could do that if you got commitment?","Tom Martin","Yes. You could do that within 6 to 8 months.","Operator","Thank you. And I show no further questions.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you all very much. Hope you\u2019ll tune into the baseball game in a couple of hours. Good night.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"12300":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.(NYSE:KMI) Q4 2011 Earnings Call January 18, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Rich Kinder - Chairman and CEO","Kim Dang - VP & CFO","Tim Bradley - President, CO2","Analysts","Gabe Moreen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering","Operator","Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session during today's call. (Operator Instructions). Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. I will now turn today's call over to your host Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you Erin and welcome to the Kinder Morgan conference call. As usual we will be talking about Kinder Morgan Energy Partners which is one of the largest MLPs in America and about Kinder Morgan Inc., which I will refer to as KMI which is the general partner of KMP.","Also as usual we will be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I will give an overview of the results and accomplishments for 2011 and for the fourth quarter and an outlook for 2012 and Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer will give you the financial details for 2011. Then we will open it up for questions and Park Shaper, our President; Steve Kean and I will be available to answer any and all questions that you might have.","Let me just start with KMI. It\u2019s a simple and very positive story. Back when we did the IPO, we anticipated that we would have cash available to pay dividends for the year 2011 of $820 million and that we would use that to pay $1.16 in dividends. As a point of fact on a paid basis, we had $835 million in cash available for dividends and we paid $1.18.","Now if you move to the declared basis, we are declaring for this quarter $0.31, that means that actually our declared basis for 2011 we will have paid a $1.20, net $0.31 is obviously a penny increase since last quarter and is up 7% from the dividend that we declared that we anticipated when we did the IPO back in February of 2011.","As usual the results at KMI are driven by KMP and we\u2019ve already previously stated that for 2012 on a declared basis we expect KMI to pay dividends, to declare dividends of a $1.35 a share, that\u2019s a 13% increase over the 2011 declared dividend of a $1.20. And note that while we previously have presented dividends on a paid basis, from now forward they are going to be on a declared basis. If you look at it on a paid basis, our anticipated dividend for 2012 would be a $1.30 which is 12% above the 2011 budgeted amount. If that doesn\u2019t confuse you, I don\u2019t know what will. But at any rate, a very positive story and exceeded what we promised you in the IPO about 10 months ago or 11 months ago.","So obviously let me turn now to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which is the driving force in the Kinder Morgan story. As you know about 98% to 99% of the cash generated at KMI comes as a result of distributions that come up from KMP. And at KMP, really the story has been, is, always will be about just two things. The first thing is the current cash that we generate which determines the current dividends and secondly it\u2019s about the future growth of the operations which leads to increased cash flow in future years and therefore increased dividends.","So I think it\u2019s the right way to look at 2011 is to look at it through those two perspectives and if you do that I think anyway you cut it, 2011 was a very good year. 2012 looks like it\u2019s going to be an even better year.","Let me start from the vantage point of the current performance and Kim will give you a lot more details, but we will have distributed $4.61 for 2011 at KMP. That\u2019s up almost 5% from the $4.40 we distributed for 2010. All five of our business segments produced earnings before DD&A in excess of what they produced in 2010 and our total segment earnings before DD&A was up 10% for the full year of 2011 when compared to full year 2010.","In terms of distributable cash flow before certain items, we were up 16% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year and if you look at it on per unit basis, distributable cash flow per unit which we think is the best way to judge our performance, we were at $4.68 for 2011 versus $4.43 in 2010. That\u2019s an increase of 5.6%.","Another way of looking at it, of course markets are what they are, but we had very good returns for our unit holders and shareholders in 2011. KMP produced at an all end return of 29%, KMR 26% and KMI 11% on an annualized basis. So that\u2019s looking at it from a current performance perspective. If you look at it from a future of growth perspective, during 2011 we put $2.6 billion into expansion, JVs and acquisitions. And this is the life blood for growing the company in the future.","I think we have tremendous opportunities for future growth in our set of businesses and that opportunity is really pretty diverse in nature. It relates to the continued emergence of natural gas shale plays, together with their associated liquids production. It relates to growth in CO2 demand in the Permian Basin. I\u2019ll talk about that later. We\u2019ve seen an acceleration of that demand over the last several quarters.","It relates to the increasing demand for export coal in our Terminals group. And the further mandates for the use of renewable fuels in both our Terminals and Products group. It also results from the opportunity to serve customers who want to export refined products, primarily diesel on the Gulf Coast, from US refineries on the Gulf Coast and to import gasoline into the Northeastern United States as we\u2019ve had a closure of several refineries in that area as all of you know. In fact, I would say that this is the most diverse set of opportunities at any time in Kinder Morgan\u2019s 15-year history.","Now let me talk about each business segment and again, looking at it through this twin perspectives of both present performance and future growth. In our Products Pipeline segment for full year 2011, we had good results on our Cochin pipeline and on Plantation and on our West Coast terminals. This was offset somewhat by lower volumes and revenues on our Pacific System and on Central Florida and our CALNEV pipelines.","To put that in perspective, for the fourth quarter, refined product volumes were down 2.5% compared to fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, the volumes were relatively flat for 2010. We always like to compare that with the EIA numbers on a national basis and those EIA members showed a decline of 1.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.3% for the full year. So getting to the point, our pipelines were a little worse than the EIA average in the fourth quarter, a little bit better for the full year.","If you look at the full year on our pipelines and break it out by commodity, diesel was actually up 0.4%. Jet fuel was up 4.1%, a pretty positive year and gasoline was off 1.4%. Now still in the Product segment, if you look ahead through the perspective of future growth, we have got a number of important projects in this segment.","One of the most important is our new Eagle Ford crude condensate line which will connect the Eagle Ford shale play with the Houston Ship Channel, that\u2019s about a $220 million project. We are under construction. We expect to be in service by July of this year. Connected to that project, we have now announced a $130 million project to build a condensate processing facility or a splitter at our Galena Park facility on the Eastern Ship channel which will be connected to this new Eagle Ford Condensate line.","We already have 25,000 barrels per day of capacity being supported by contract with a major oil customer. The operation is expandable to a 100,000 barrels. We are actually now filing for the environmental permits at the 50,000 barrel level which we think is very doable from a demand standpoint and that would turn this $130 million project into roughly a $160 million project and ultimately as I said, the whole thing is expandable to a 100,000 barrels per day. We respect this project to be in service around June of 2014.","We also have a new pipeline also costing about $220 million and that's the Parkway pipeline. This is a 136 miles of 16 inch pipe and it will run from Norco, Louisiana up to Collins, Mississippi to connect to a storage drum on our plantation system. We do own 50% of that; Bolero owns the other 50%. The initial capacity is 110,000 barrels per day and again it\u2019s also expandable. In this case up to 200,000 barrels per day and we expect to be in service in mid 2013.","Another project that hasn't received a lot of attention but which is imminent is our Cochin EP project. We are spending about $30 million to upgrade existing pipelines in order to facilitate the transportation of EP mix from Conway Sarnia, Ontario and this is providing service to our customer Nova. We expect to be in service on April 1 of this year.","And then we have two projects on the West Coast that are fairly significant. One is our Carson-7 project. That's a $77 million project building seven new tanks at our Carson, California terminal. That\u2019s on schedule and budget. We brought the first two tanks online, the remaining five tanks will come online late in 2012 and early 2013.","And then our final project is our private Air Force Base storage and pipeline projects, a little short of $50 million in terms of CapEx and we expect to finish that project this quarter, the first quarter of 2012. So that's it on our products\u2019 pipeline segment.","In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment of course 2011 was a good year for us; our transportation volumes were up 13%. That\u2019s largely result of our pay will Fayetteville Express project coming online and strong volumes from the Eagle Ford on our Texas Intrastate. Our sales volumes were up 1% for the year. We had strong performance as a result of the KinderHawk and EagleHawk acquisitions and as a result of FEP and Eagle together and the processing spreads on our Casper-Douglas facility in Wyoming and we also had increased volumes on Red Cedar. Those positive results were offset in part by weaker performance on our Kinder Morgan Intrastate Gas Transmission and Trailblazers systems.","Now when you look at the future of natural gas and let me just say that all the projects I am talking about today and all the numbers we\u2019re talking about today do not account for any impact from the El Paso acquisition at all. And obviously that\u2019s very relevant for the natural gas segment because when we complete the El Paso acquisition that segment will increase dramatically in size. But without any impact of El Paso and looking at the future at our natural gas facilities we have a number of important projects.","First of all our Eagle Ford gathering joint venture with Copano continues to perform very well, we\u2019re starting new contracts. We are increasing deliveries as Eagle Ford for production ramps up. Including our 50% equity interest in this Eagle Ford gathering joint venture and our 25% interest in EagleHawk Field services but excluding the crude and condensate line I referred to earlier, this segment, our natural gas segment has committed approximately $400 million to expansion projects in the Eagle Ford alone.","In the Haynesville, on our gathering system mirror, we have signed a new third party contract and we have added new interconnects and trading services, we ended the year averaging about a Bcf a day as we anticipated we would for 2011.","The third important project during the quarter in the year we closed one acquisition SouthTex Treaters for $155 million on November 30. SouthTex designs and manufactures natural gas treating plants. They have removed both CO2 and H2S from the gas system. That\u2019s now part of our Kinder Morgan treating operations and that would allow us to offer our customers the option of owning or leasing this equipment. We think that broadens our earnings capability and broadens a service we can provide to our customers.","Turning to our CO2 operations for 2011, we had a record year. We were right on plan for earnings before DD&A and slightly above plan, if you look at it on the DCF basis. Now we benefited from higher oil and NGL prices. They ran about $6.00 higher than we had in our plan. And we also benefited from growing production at the Katz field and from some pretty successful effort to manage and reduce our cost across all of our operations. That management effort, they reduced cost more than offset an overall decline in SACROC and Yates production.","We also set annual production record just barely in our CO2 source fields in south west Colorado. The major disappointment was that Katz volumes did not live up to what we predicted. That\u2019s our new field which we began flooding at early 2011.","To put that in perspective for you, for the full-year 2011, we averaged about 500 barrels a day. For the fourth quarter, we averaged about 1000 barrels a day and so far this quarter we are running at about 1,300 barrels per day. So what we believe is that our response was delayed by about 8 to 12 months beyond what we thought we would get when we originally projected our 2011 budget. But it is now behaving on a ramped up basis as we thought. It\u2019s just coming on later. And when you come to our investor conference later this month, you will see that we\u2019re projecting around 2,300 barrels to little over 2,300 barrels of production on average per day for 2012.","So we intend to see or expect to see a nice ramp up during 2012. The big opportunity though in CO2 for the future is satisfying. What\u2019s really turning out to be a very strong demand from our customers in the Permian Basin for more CO2? Now, on previous calls I\u2019ve talked about an opportunity size that would involve adding 200 to 300 million cubic feet a day of production from the source fields that would involve investing, I had said, $1 billion to $1.3 billion of additional capital at good returns.","We now think the opportunity is probably a little bigger than that and maybe as much as 400 to 600 million cubic feet a day of additional need for CO2 in the Permian Basin. That would translate an opportunity into opportunities to spend anywhere from $1 billion on the low side of this to $2 billion on the upside in accessing more production from our source fields and in moving that to market in the Permian Basin.","Now as we always say at Kinder Morgan, we are only going to do this if we are backed, if that demand is backed by solid contracts from creditworthy companies over extended periods of time and right now that\u2019s looking very good. Tim Bradley will have more to say about that at our investor conference next week but today our board did approve in part an important first step in generating this additional CO2. We approved $255 million project in our Doe Canyon field in Southwest Colorado, which will take production there up from a 105 million cubic feet a day today to a 170 million cubic feet a day.","That $255 million will be spent over the next several years and will involve both in pricing and additional wealth. So a lot of opportunity here for real growth at very attractive returns backed by long-term contracts.","Turning to our terminal operation, in 2011 we continued to generate strong earnings before DD&A and DCF. I think it is important to note about 70% of that growth or about $40 million was attributable to organic sources as supposed to acquisitions and I know when we talk about that, we think 2% may be a little better in growth from organic sources in Kinder Morgan. People wonder well, where does that come from; 2% of the 2011 numbers would be 60 to 70 million and here we had $40 million of growth in the terminals group alone, from organic sources.","Now, where did that growth come from? We had strong growth in coal volume channels. We have been talking about that export coal story now for several quarter, we were up 33% in terms of coal volumes handled in the fourth quarter. More importantly for the full year we were up 20% versus 2010. And our Pier IX facility in Newport News, Virginia set a record; in that one terminal we handled almost 13 million tons of coal.","Our steel volumes were also positive for the year, up 18% in the fourth quarter, up 10% for the year. On the liquids terminal side, we had good performance at both our enormous Pasadena terminal here on the Houston Ship Channel and in our Carteret facility in New York Harbor.","We also handled 16 million barrels of ethanol in the fourth quarter. That was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2010. For the full year, our ethanol volumes were up 5%. If you look at Kinder Morgan including the products segment, we still are handling about 30% of all the ethanol used in the United States.","Now in our Terminals Group, we had an unusually large number of new commercial contracts signed which will lead over the next few years to some pretty important new projects. Our capital budget there for expansion CapEx is over $400 million for 2012 and in fact we have, based on commercial contracts signed specifically in 2011, we now have budgeted over $850 million in CapEx in the terminals projects over the next couple of years \u201912 and \u201913 and the first quarter of \u201914 to be specific on projects that were locked in for certain contracts that we\u2019re done during 2011.","So coming back to this perspective of looking at what did we accomplished from a future growth standpoint? The terminals had a tremendous year in 2011. First of all, the BOSTCO project, which probably the largest single project that we entered into. In December, we purchased TransMontaigne\u2019s 50% interest, so we now own 98% of this $430 million project on the Houston Ship Channel.","And now let me remind you that as we previously said, and TransMontaigne has previously said, we have made that purchase; they do have certain rights to repurchase for a one year period; so between now and January of next year. But right now, we own 98% of the project. This first phase of that project will involve 52 storage tanks with the capacity of 6.6 million barrels; we\u2019re handling residual fuel, distillates and other black oils. We have terminal service contracts or LOIs for all of that capacity.","Eventually, we see this terminal because of its location and the draft adjacent to this terminal. We see this as an important cog in the ability of Houston Ship Channel refiners to export refined products given the advantageous location and depth of water. The construction on this project started in December of 2011.","Another major project that we announced during 2011 was the Edmonton South Terminal. This is roughly a $210 million project at Edmonton Alberta. It involves building 2.4 million barrels of capacity for storage of crude oil and condensate. And our Trans Mountain Terminal has access right into our Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs across the Rockies and down into Vancouver and Washington State.","We\u2019ll start construction on this in early this year and we expect to have it in service late in 2013. Now this is another project that anticipate will be scaled up over the next few years. We will eventually on that site build up to 6 million barrels in two additional phases. What this does for our customers, who are primarily oil sands producers and marketers, is it gives them additional optionality to use the oil sands production as that production expands and as crude oil pricing and differentials continue to remain extremely volatile as they have over the past several months.","We also will continue to expand our capacity for export coal at both IMT on Mississippi River, in Houston and eventually on some of our terminals on the East Coast; so a lot of opportunities for upside in our Terminals Group over the next few years.","In Kinder Morgan Canada, we had a good year in 2011 as refiners in Washington State wanted access to cheap oil sands production and the oil sands producers wanted to move more barrels over our dock in Vancouver, British Columbia. We expect that demand growth to continue; for that reason we are in the midst of an open season on an expansion to Trans Mountain. At the customer\u2019s request, we extended that open season until mid-February and again we will proceed only if we have adequate binding commitments from customers to go forward. But we do see this as a tremendous opportunity in the future.","So all-in-all, we think we had a very good 2011 and we\u2019ve build tremendous opportunities for 2012 and beyond. We expect to declare $4.98 in distribution for 2012 and to have excess coverage on top of that of about $70 million.","In addition, I\u2019ll remind you that we said before the El Paso merger was announced, that we thought for the next several years, we could grow KMP at 5% which would lead to 10% growth at KMI. Post El Paso, we believe that we can grow at 7% at KMP and about 12% at KMI. But it\u2019s important to note that all the numbers I\u2019ve given to you again are pre-El Paso and we\u2019ve well exceeded the 5% and 10% growth numbers that we talked about previously for growth at KMP and KMI respectively.","So we have good strong cash flow, very good growth opportunities for the future. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Okay. If you turn to the first page, its numbers entitles the consolidated statement of income. I am not going to spend much time on this page, but just looking down, about 80% down the page, there is declared distribution per unit. We are declaring a distribution today at KMP of $1.16 per unit. That compares to a $1.13 last year and that\u2019s up $0.03 quarter-to-quarter or about 3% growth. For the year, we have declared $4.61. That compares to 2010 of $4.40. That\u2019s $0.21 per unit increase or almost a 5% increase. The $4.61 is also a $0.01 above our 2011 budget.","With that, I\u2019ll turn to the second page of numbers called the contribution by business segments. Looking four lines from the bottom, the DCF before certain items for the fourth quarter in 2011 $425 million of DCF before certain items that compares to 2010 of $366 million, $59 million increase or about 16%. For the year, 1.5 billion to 5 billion; that compares to 1.36 billion in 2010; that\u2019s a $165 million increase or about 12% versus our budget, the 1.5 billion to 5 billion. We are up about $11 million versus our budget.","If you look at what that translates into in terms of DCF per unit, that\u2019s a $1.27 per unit which is about 8.5% growth versus last year for the quarter and for the year $4.68 per unit which is growth of almost 6%.","Our coverage, that was in excess coverage for the quarter of about $37 million. For the year, about $21 million and versus our budget we\u2019re about $70 million below our budget with respect to coverage. But let me just give you an overall view versus our budget.","The segments ended up largely inline with their budget; interest was favorable about a little over $25 million; sustaining CapEx was positive versus our budget about $13 million. The total DCF available for distribution to our Limited Partners and our General Partners were up about $38 million versus our budget.","Our GP; we paid our GP about $27 million more than we budgeted. That was a function of incremental units that we issued during the year; about $5 million primarily associated with KinderHawk and the $0.01 that we increased the distribution.","So that leaves us with LC DCF versus our budget, about $11 million above our budget; then we also paid our Limited Partners about $26 million more, again because we increased the distribution above our budget and also because we had incremental units outstanding. And so that leaves us at about $16 million of lower coverage than what we budgeted.","Now if you adjust for Canadian tax refund that we expected to receive in 2011 that we did not receive in 2011, but we received notification that we will receive in 2012 and it is not included in our 2012 budget that we will go through next week. You add back that $6 million and you adjust for the incremental penny that was not in our budget, that's another roughly $6 million and you are within a few million dollars of our budget on coverage.","With that looking back up at the lines above the DCF before certain items, you look at book cash taxes, net $7.9 million in the quarter, $5 million last year, up $2.9 million. For the year $27 million versus $26 million last year, so up about a $1 million. For the year versus our budget, down about $10.9 million, but I think the key here is and what's important is really the cash taxes because all we are doing is adding back the book taxes. So the book taxes have no impact and then subtracting out the cash taxes. Absent the Canadian tax refunds, the cash taxes were on budget for the year.","Express, Endeavor and Eagle Ford contributions, these are adjustments that we make for investments that we have where the cash that we received doesn't track net income plus JV DD&A less our share sustaining CapEx, $7 million in the quarter, $2 million last year up $5 million, for the 12 months $15 million versus $5 million last year. So up $10 million and up about $8 million over our budget. We received incremental distributions from all three of these investments versus our budget.","Looking at sustaining CapEx, $72 million for the quarter, $58 million in the fourth quarter of last year, that's about $14 million increase in sustaining CapEx, $212 million for the year, that compares to $179 million last year, so up about $33 million versus last year, but actually about $13 million positive versus our budget. The $13 million versus our budget really breaks down into two pieces. Five is really lower capitalized overheads, basically our capitalized overhead rate is based on our total spending, our total expansion and sustaining capital. Our expansion capital increased significantly, so that rate came down but our sustaining capital was flat. So a lot of it is a function of capitalized overhead versus any changes in the segment spending.","$8 million is associated with the segment spending and that\u2019s really at CO2, about half of that we didn\u2019t have to do a power plant, overhaul the turbine for the flat power plant in CO2. And the other half is some non-safety, non-integrity deferrals. Now looking up at the segments and seeing what drove the growth, products pipeline, a $161 million in the quarter versus a $171 million last year or about $10 million down this year.","That compares to $694 million for the full year versus $688 million last year, that\u2019s up about $7 million. Products came in about $36 million lower than its budget or about 5% and if you cut through it all, it is primarily SFPP. We had some ups and down on you know the different assets within the segment. And SFPP was largely associated with three things. With deferred rate case, rate cases and the lower rates that we implemented there with an adverse decision with respect to [UPR] right away cost, so increased right away cost and then lower volumes than what we budgeted.","Natural gas, in the fourth quarter $290 million versus $243 million a year ago, that\u2019s up $47 million or 19%. For the 12 months, $951 million versus $836 million a year ago, up a $115 million or 14%. Natural gas was about 5% above this budget and that is largely a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, actually the KinderHawk acquisition contributes more than what they were above their budget and then we have some offsets primarily with some higher integrity spending on the Texas intrastate and lower fuel charges or collections on KMI and Trailblazer. Upstream was also up nicely for the year from higher processing margins and higher gathering volumes.","CO2 in the quarter, $281 million versus $242 million a year ago, up $39 million or 16% for the year, $1.093 billion, that compares to $960 million a year ago or up $133 million or 14%. CO2 was really on its budget. In reality it was slightly below its budget on earnings before DD&A and slightly above its budget on a DCF basis. That primarily was driven by, SACROC was above its budget as a result of higher price and lower OpEx and that was offset somewhat by lower volumes than what we budgeted. And then Katz and Eastern Shelf had lower volumes than what we budgeted. Yates & S&T were on their budget.","Terminal Segment, a $184 million in the third quarter, on the fourth quarter, a $173 million a year ago, up $12 million or 7%. For the year, $701 million versus $647 million a year ago, up $55 million or 8%. Terminal was about 2% below its budget. That was a function of higher fuel costs, timing on acquisitions versus our budget. Some of the acquisitions that we did happened later in the year than what we had originally thought. It is lower transload volumes, primarily ethanol in our material handling business, primarily as it lost some market share to unit trains. And then we had a steel mill that we served that was down for an extended period of time.","Kinder Morgan Canada for the quarter, $51 million versus $49 million a year ago, up $2 million or 4%. For the year, a $199 million versus a $182 million a year-ago, up 17% or 9%. For the year, Kinder Morgan Canada was about 3% above its budget and that was a function of FX, the implementation of a neutral settlement and then higher domestic volumes on our Express Platte pipelines.","Dropping down, about half way down the page to the G&A which you will see below the segment earnings contribution. G&A for the quarter, $86 million versus $87 million a year ago, still about a $1 million decrease. For the year, $388 million versus $375 million a year ago, still up about $13 million versus a year ago. The full-year number is up versus last year primarily due to a higher benefit. But it is right on top of our budget.","Interest expense which is the next line, a $137 million in the quarter, a $132 million a year ago, that is increased expense of about $5 million year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. For the year, it is up about $25 million and versus our budget as I mentioned earlier, it is about $28 million above our budget.","Now dropping down to the certain items, there are a couple that I will mention to you, most of them are relatively small this quarter, total certain items in the quarter, about $12.5 million, $3.8 million is associated with some higher environmental reserves that we took during the quarter. $5.2 million is associated with market-to-market on our CO2 hedges and then you can see in the footnotes down there, we continue to recognize those in the quarter as we settle those hedges and don\u2019t mark them to market prior to that time up in the segment.","Insurance deductible casualty losses and reimbursement, that\u2019s associated with a small fire that we had on our Total petcoke facility. For the year, certain items $491 million, the largest certain items, $82 million associated with allocated non-cash compensation. This is a $100 million pool that was paid by our shareholders, but GAAP requires us to allocate these cost to KMP. We have talked about this in our prior quarter.","KMP has not and will not pay anything associated with this (inaudible) program. Rate case reserves $235 million and we\u2019ve discussed those in prior quarters and the KinderHawk asset write-off of a $167 million, that we have also discussed in prior quarters. So with that I will move to the balance sheet. Just two items to note on the balance sheet. You can see on cash and cash equivalent, we are up about $280 million from year end 2010 to year end 2011. A reasonable portion of that is associated with Dock premiums that we receive on our Canadian Westridge Dock and this is shipped on our Trans Mountain pipeline to pay a premium in order to get access to that Dock and then we actually refund those amounts over a three to five year timeframe.","The other thing I\u2019d point out is on notes payable and current maturities of long-term debt. The $2.138 billion at 12\/31\/11 includes $500 million of 9% put bond. The timeframe with respect to the bondholder\u2019s right to put those to us has expired and so only $50,000 worth of these bonds were put in our K. We will move the balance of that to long-term.","Looking down at the debt balance $12.4 billion at the end of the year that compares to about $11.4 billion at the end of last year, a $979 million increase for the year and about a $153 million increase in the quarter. For the quarter we had uses of a little over $600 million. That was about $290 million in CapEx, about $250 million in acquisitions. The largest acquisitions were SouthTex for $155 million, Watco for $50 million and then our purchase of Trans Mountain interest in the Bosco terminal for $30 million.","Contributions to equity investments was about $75 million, primarily associated with our joint venture in the Eagle Ford with Copano and with our 25% interest in the Eagle Ford with BHP. Equity issuance for the quarter was over $250 million and that was about 145 million through our KMP at-the-market program and than 109 on our KMR dividend. ","Working capital was a little bit over 200 million during the quarter. The largest piece of it during the quarter is really accrued interest. We typically paid most of our interest payment comp in the first and the third quarter. The Dock premiums as I mentioned we\u2019ve receive a fair amount of Dock premiums during the fourth quarter. AP and AR was a source of cash of $30 million. We also had excess coverage as I mentioned earlier of 37 million and uses offsetting that, was gas and storage and [cash flows over draft].","For the year the change in debt $979 million. The uses were just about 2.76 billion, was about 987 million in CapEx a billion to 1.24 billion and acquisitions. In addition to the one time mentioned in the quarter for the year. We also have the KinderHawk acquisition for 912 million, 371 million in contributions equity investment, the largest one was the contribution to FEP. Then we also paid off some $77 million of incremental debt when we brought KinderHawk on to our balance sheet. We paid $81 million in CPC and perk settlement. We issued about $1.42 billion in equity between KMP and KMR and then we settled an interest rate swap, which were a source of cash at $73 million.","We sold a small terminal on the Netherlands, which is a source of $16 million and the working capital and other items were a source of cash of $271 million. For the year the sources of working capital, primarily the Dock premiums, coverage. We also had distributions from equity investments in excess of what we reflect in our DCF and then we had a loan to plantation which they repaid.","That results in a DEBT to EBITDA for the end of the year up 3.6 times. On the third quarter call I had said that we would end the year at about 3.7 times. We did a little bit better than that given the incremental equity that we issued in November and December that we hadn\u2019t contemplated at the end of the third quarter and then also some of the cash that we received associated with the dock premiums.","So, that\u2019s KMP looking at KMI, but the first case of numbers in your package you\u2019ll see excluding the interim capital transaction and that relates to a one-time item that we had in 2010. And so we provide this because this is what is going to appear in the 10-K. But we don\u2019t think this is a real way to look at our business and we would be happy to if it shows 28% growth for the year but we think the more appropriate way to look at our business is to adjust for that one-time item in 2010. And so looking at the second page which excludes the ITT, this is what we are going to focus on.","Now with respect to the numbers presented on this page. This is represented on the page. And so what we are looking at for the fourth quarter is what KMI received from KMP in the fourth quarter, based on the dividend that KMP declared for the third quarter of last year. So, we\u2019re looking at, that\u2019s the cash generated and then we are comparing that to the dividend that KMI paid during the fourth quarter, which would be $0.30 and that is in contrast to the dividend that we\u2019re declaring today of $0.31.","Going forward, we will switch to a declared basis in order to be consistent with KMP. But looking at cash available to pay dividends, $243 million in the quarter versus $233 million a year ago, up 20 million or 9%. For the year, 835 million versus 763 million a year ago or up $72 million or 9%.","The 835 million was the cash available. We also paid out 835 million, which is a $1.18 that was already paid. $1.18 as Rich mentioned earlier, compares to our budget of $1.16 and so we exceeded our budget by $0.02.","Today what we are declaring is $0.31 a share. So, another reason that we\u2019re making the switch from paid basis to declared basis is so that people can see, so that we can present for people, the numbers that we are basing the dividend that we\u2019re declaring on.","And so, just to switch 2011 to a declared basis, cash available to pay dividend, if you presented it on a declared basis, would be $866 million. Dividends paid and that includes obviously the $0.31 or dividends declared using the 31 [Technical Difficulty] of excess coverage for the year looking at 2011 on a declared basis and given the $0.31 that we are declaring today. ","Now looking at what drove the growth in the year, if you look up about four lines from the top of the page, total KMP distribution were up $361 million in the quarter versus $315 million last year, $36 million increase or 11%. For the year $1.349 billion versus $1.202 billion a year ago, a $148 million increase or a 12% increase. That\u2019s the $1.349 billion is about $19 million over our budget, primarily driven by the incremental amount that we received on the GP interest as a function of more units outstanding versus our budgets and the penny increase in the distribution.","NGPL, the next line item, NGPL cash available for distribution to us. You will see that we switched that from the prior quarter when we previously showed dividends paid to us given that we owed only 20% of this investment, we cannot control what they declare or what dividend out. But the cash is there. So what we are presenting is net income, actually pretax income plus DD&A, less cash taxes less sustaining cash balance. So we are presenting the cash that is actually generated by this entity given that we can\u2019t control the difference, $7.6 million in the quarter versus zero last year up $10.6 million for the year, $30.3 million versus $34.7 million a year ago, down $4.4 million and down about $3 million versus our budget and that's just a function of lower transport margin and LPS on GPL.","G&A expense, basically up $3.5 million versus the fourth quarter last year, up $12.8 million versus for a year ago, versus a year ago and within about $2 million of our budget. Interest expense, $5.6 million in the quarter versus $5 million a year ago, basically flat, up slightly which has to do with slightly higher balance and for the year up $8.3 million and slightly positive versus our budget.","Cash taxes, $22.7 million, higher in the quarter versus a year ago and $49.7 million higher for the year right on top of our budget. They are higher versus a year ago due to the higher income.","So with that for KMI, I will turn to the balance sheet. Looking at KMI\u2019s debt on the balance sheet, $3.236 billion as of 12\/31 of \u201911 versus $3.195 billion versus at 12\/31 of \u201910, so up about $41 million for the year, up $44 million for the quarter and let me just go through a quick reconciliation on that.","For the quarter, we had $243 million available to pay dividends. We paid dividends of $212 million. We also had a use of cash to pay El Paso financing fees of $56 million and then we had some items associated within GPL that were about $18 million. The metrics that we show versus the distributions that we actually received were about $9 million lower. And then NGPL actually reimbursed that from G&A in early January versus by the end of the year.","For the year, $41 million increase in debt; $835 million in cash available to pay dividends. $771 million in dividends paid. $64 million went out on a $100 million pool, when you add the $771 million of the dividends and the $64 million, that\u2019s $835 million so that\u2019s the $835 million that we referred to as paying in dividends, because our shareholders actually paid for the $100 million bonus pool.","The MBO settlement was a positive $29 million after-tax. KMR which we elected not to sell at the end of the year, you need to subtract $46 million, because we include that benefit in our metric; $56 million went out on the El Paso financing fees. We got about $69 million in tax refunds that were associated with one-time items and then $18 million that I mentioned on NGPL were the same for the year as they were in the quarter. That leaves us at 2.4 times on debt to distribution proceed; so a very strong balance sheet.","Rich Kinder","Alright. Okay, Kim thank you and Erin we\u2019ll take any questions that our guests may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Gabe Moreen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Gabe Moreen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Good. I look forward to seeing everyone next week so we can ask more questions there but two questions if I could. One, I don\u2019t know if Kim touched on it, but just the REX tax settlement; I was wondering if that was material for the quarter if that\u2019s more of just an ongoing thing?","Kim Dang","It\u2019s about $8 million in the quarter and yes it will have a favorable impact on our 2012 budget as well.","Gabe Moreen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","And then not to purse first earnings press release is too much, but just in terms of volumes at KinderHawk and what they are doing sequentially. I guess maybe if you can talk a little bit about your outlook for volumes there; what they have been doing lately, maybe also where they stand relative to them, contractual minimum commitments and then just may be also how material that third-party commit to you got in KinderHawk to prove to?","Rich Kinder","Well, the third party commitment is important in the terms of third party volumes, obviously still the great bulk of volumes are coming from now BHP. We averaged around a Bcf a day for the year 2011 in our budget and we\u2019ll discuss more of this next week in our budget for this coming year in 2012, Tom we expect about, average about 1.2. And that\u2019s based on the latest intelligence we have from both our third party customers and BHP. So that kind of gives you an idea of what we did in 2011 and what we expect to do in 2012.","Operator","Next we have Brian Zarahn with Barclays Capital.","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","A little bit on BOSTCO, can you talk a little about the potential scale of that terminal and also the competitive dynamics in the region?","Rich Kinder","Well, first of all, the way with the ship channel of course, this is absolutely prime location in terms of how far down the channel it is and the draft there. So we think it has inherent compelling advantages and I think that the real proof of that is that we\u2019ve signed either terminal service agreements or we have LOIs for actually all of that capacity and a little more. And we think eventually, we will be available to expand that with a second dock and with additional tank and again eventually we think that would connect back to our Galena Park and Pasadena terminals and we will actually be able to move a variety of products down there.","Again, I think I\u2019ve said this before, but I know I\u2019ve said it earlier today that we believe that in the Gulf Coast, you have significant additional U.S. refining capacity being built. There will not be a demand for all of that production and we think that a good bit of it, particularly diesel will actually get exported particularly to South America, and if you believe that, Houston and Port Arthur and Beaumont are ideal areas to structure some facility to handle export volumes and that\u2019s essentially what we\u2019re doing.","On the other hand, we\u2019ve got some major expansions on our Carteret facility, all subject to long-term contracts in New York Harbor. While that capacity is being utilized by our customers who are actually importing primarily gasoline into the U.S. Northeast to replace volumes that are no longer there because refineries in the Northeast were closed. So long-term, we think BOSTCO could become a much larger facility, I don\u2019t think Jeff is in the room, but we have a lot of excess acreage here that allows us to build out significant additional storage beyond the 6.6 million barrels.","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","In terms of the average contract life you talked a little bit about that what you expect of BOSTCO will be inline with your other liquids terminals?","Rich Kinder","Yeah I think so may be even just have along, inline with our other liquids terminals.","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","And a final question from me, can you talk a little bit more about the rail opportunities you see in 2012?","Rich Kinder","I am sorry, the rail opportunities?","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","Yes, Watco and other\u2026.","Rich Kinder","Yeah, we made another preferred investment with Watco which is part of our original arrangement with them and we think there are going to be additional opportunities. Now clearly the fact that pipeline capacity is being built out of Cushing down to the Gulf Coast I think makes rail opportunities out of Cushing more difficult to put together on any kind of termed up basis then was the case before that reversal was announced. But we continue to look at opportunities and again and directly through our preferred investment in this short line rail road Watco, we\u2019re getting some of that exposure; but we don\u2019t have anything further to say about new opportunities right now.","Operator","Next we have Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","A couple of quick questions for you and on the CO2 side of business I realize Tim\u2019s going to go through this next week, but just from a big picture perspective, aside from the CapEx that you outlined regarding the transport portion of CO2, from a production standpoint, how are guys thinking about the balance of maintenance versus growth CapEx for 2012? And what I am really trying to get a rough idea of is your returns on each incremental dollar that\u2019s invested to grow 2012 production minus what you can do on the cost cutting line?","Rich Kinder","Tim, you want to answer that?","Tim Bradley","If I understand the question right, what\u2019s the trade off between growing our distributable cash flow through investments versus cost cutting; and I think the profound leverage is on the investment side. With that investment, our production will ultimately decline and growing that production or at least stabilizing that production is a much bigger impact on what we can save by cutting costs. Is that what you are aiming at?","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Yeah, that\u2019s exactly. Tim is it possible at this point to just put some rough numbers around it?","Tim Bradley","We are going to go over some details next week at the conference. I guess I can cover the cost cutting as well as the investment program at that point in time and probably answer more detailed questions there.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Last question from me Rich, just kind of again a big picture question. As it relates to the Bakken, within product pipes how do you guys think about moving Bakken barrels either on Cochin or of course within KM Canada possibly converting a portion of Platte and accessing that point at Guernsey to take barrels down to Wood River?","Rich Kinder","Well, we continue to look at both those options. There is clearly a need for more transportation at the Bakken and of course our missing volumes on Platte are consistently running full. So we\u2019re looking at a couple of different things and as you know we\u2019ve talked about converting a part of KMI what we call the Pony Line to back to oil. We\u2019ve had some good interest in that, not prepared yet to sale; that\u2019s ease across nice and dotted and so there is a lot of different opportunities on Cochin or doing something by converting Pony I think would be the two most likely ways we would take advantage of it. But clearly, the demand there is a question of what\u2019s the best way to solve it and that\u2019s where we\u2019re looking at right now.","Operator","And next we have Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor Pickering","A couple of questions on the product pipeline side of things. The condensate processing project that you guys have announced; just trying to understand may be potential for growth in that project; is the market opportunity there really to basically find the best end use for condensate coming out of the Eagle Ford given that high complexity refineries on the Golf Coast may be can\u2019t effectively use all that Eagle Ford crude?","Rich Kinder","Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good summation and of course that\u2019s why the nature of the commitment and in this case we already have 25,000 barrels a day committed is very important because that commitment will basically determine how we run it in terms of what products we produce.","As we\u2019ve said further, just all kinds of opportunities there you know one that several people have talked about which is a possibilities sounds sort of strange from a geographic location standpoint, but the possibility that some of this could be converted of doing with and given the back that there is a not as much demand on some of this pipelines going from North to South to move it up, for example explore we can move it into Cochin or Southern lines or some place else and get it all the way back to Canada.","And there are actually now Canadian producers down here looking at that kind of opportunity and a lot of other opportunities. But you\u2019re right; I mean the idea will be to maximize the diversity of the utilization of that condensate coming in from the Eagle Ford. So we think it\u2019s and I think the time has come and again, we are actually applying this month for our environmental permits and we are doing at 50,000 barrels per day because we think that\u2019s probably where we will end up and then we will have the expandability up to a 100,000 barrels a day. I think it\u2019s kind of unlikely we will be at there, be at that point the startup that we will have, fairly cheap or fairly reasonable expandability up to 100,000 barrels a day.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Okay, great. And when you, when that processing facility converts Eagle Ford crude into those very light end products, do those products that the processing facility will be creating, are those products subject to any kind of export restrictions the way that crude oil is off the Gulf Coast?","Tim Bradley","And you know it is condensate that we are sliding and not crude and my understanding is for the most part, no.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Okay, great. And another question on the product pipeline side of things, the Cochin project to deliver ethane-propane mix to Sarnia. Any comments just on what the type of volumes that Sarnia can take down of that EP mix and I guess, kind of looking forward is there opportunities for growth as may be some heavy oil crackers in Sarnia convert to an EP feedstock.","Rich Kinder","Yeah, it\u2019s a little beyond my knowledge base. We have a count as we like to do, we left somebody else to take those important issues. But we have a contract with Nova, it\u2019s a three year contract for certain amount of volumes and that\u2019s up to them and clearly as everybody knows some of that demand at Sarnia, a large portion of those is eventually going to be serviced from the Marcellus. But for the next three years anyway, Nova is interested in moving volumes up there and so, we will just see what happens after that.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","And those are going to be Marcellus sourced EP volumes?","Rich Kinder","No, they are going to use a Conway sourced volumes.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James","Okay, Conway and just one final question. You mentioned turning the Pony line on KMI to potentially to oil service. And I guess, as you think towards the future and think towards the KMI pro forma for the El Paso acquisition. Is there any potential to move hypothetically of a pipeline were to be, I guess, if you were to be asked by the regulatory agencies to divest of a pipeline. Do you think it would be something that could be a possibility just to convert a gas pipeline to a crude oil or some other kind of hydrocarbon service in order to avoid anti-trust issues?","Rich Kinder","That just is a pure speculation. At this point we\u2019re just engaged and the FDC now looking at alternatives. So, that\u2019d be pretty mature to answer that.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue.","Rich Kinder","Okay, thank you very much Erin and thanks all of you for calling in and we\u2019ll see most of you next week.","Operator","Thank you for your participation on today\u2019s call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Thank you. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Britney. And before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call includes forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measure set forth at the end of KMI's and KML's earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions, for a list of important material assumptions, expectations, and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","In my opening statements on these calls before turning it over to Kim, Steve, Dax and the rest of the team, I always try to share with you our vision for the future and our financial strategy.","On the financial front, I believe we continue to execute on our plans and our decision to sell our 70% interest in Kinder Morgan Canada and our 100% interest in the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline is indicative of that execution. As you know, we are receiving a 13x multiple of EBITDA on our Cochin asset, which is well above the multiple which KMI is trading as a whole on the New York Stock Exchange.","Now, we're able to use the proceeds from these sales, and Steve will talk more about this later, in a manner consistent with what we have previously indicated to maintain a strong balance sheet, expand our core assets, pay a healthy and growing dividend, and opportunistically buyback our stock, all these uses we believe benefit our shareholders. I should add that we received expression of interest in other assets at similar or higher multiples of EBITDA.","And let me say, there is absolutely no certainty as to whether these expressions of interest will result in transactions. That said, we will evaluate such interest as a matter of good governance and capital discipline. All this just indicates a substantial difference between the valuation of individual assets and that of the company as a whole when expressed as a multiple of EBITDA.","Turning to our vision for the future, on last quarter's call, I described our positive outlook on the future of natural gas, which is very important to us as we move about 40% of all the natural gas in America through our pipelines. And incidentally, that positive outlook was reinforced in the September report of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which projects that natural gas consumption will increase by 40% between now and 2050, even in a case where renewable energy rises dramatically.","Today though, I'd like to talk about the environmental impact of this growing natural gas utilization. First, the positive side of the story. The EPA has reported that from 2007 to 2017, total CO2 emissions in the U.S. have dropped about 14%. Even more impressive CO2 emissions from the electric power sector have dropped approximately 26% during the same period of time not without \u2013 notwithstanding an increase in the absolute amount of electricity generated.","As most of you know, this is largely the result of new natural gas-fired power plants, replacing older and dirtier coal plants, since natural gas emits approximately half as much CO2 compared to coal when burned to power. This is a huge accomplishment and demonstrates that the answer to minimizing our impact on the environment isn't simply banning fossil fuels but utilizing them responsibly.","The tremendous growth in natural gas production in America has also led to its shipment as LNG to developing countries around the world to be used in large part to replace coal-fired electricity generation with cleaner natural gas. These positive developments are pretty consistently accepted across the political landscape, but the naysayers on natural gas emphasize that its production and transportation emit too much methane into the atmosphere. There's some disagreement over the extent of these emissions, but it's clear that they are low and continue to drop, due primarily to industry-led initiatives.","Let me share with you some numbers. U.S. methane emissions from natural gas systems declined more than 14% between 1990 and 2017, despite a 53% increase in natural gas production over the same period. U.S. methane emissions, as a whole, across all industry also decreased by 16% over that period.","You might be interested to know, that methane emissions from enteric fermentation, you may want to Google that, but suffice it to say that it has to do with the digestive tract of farm animals and manure management, another key phrase, combined actually rose by 18% during that same time period.","If you took those two categories out of the equation, total U.S. methane emissions were actually down 27% during that time frame. Now all that said, our industry still needs to continue to address this issue and we are. KMI is a founding member of ONE Future, a voluntary industry initiative committed to achieving a methane leakage rate of 1% or less along the entire natural gas supply chain by 2025. In fact, our members rate is now well below that 1% target.","More specific to us, the group's target for emissions in the transportation and storage segment is 0.31%. KMI has already substantially outperformed that goal with emissions from that segment of 0.04% in 2017 improving to 0.02% in 2018. In summary, our view is that the methane emissions issue is solvable, will continue to improve and at the environmental positives of natural gas far outweigh the negatives.","And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with KMI, then turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give an update on our segment performance. Our CFO, David Michels will take you through the numbers; and Dax Sanders will update you on KML, and then we'll take your questions.","So summary on KMI is this, we are adhering to the principles that we've laid out previously for you. We have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4.5 times debt-to-EBITDA target and with ratings upgrades now from all three ratings agencies.","We are maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution, and by self-funding our investments. We are returning value to shareholders as evidenced by the 25% year-over-year dividend increase, and we continue to find attractive growth and\/or divestiture opportunities. Again, strong balance sheet, capital discipline, returning value to shareholders, and finding additional opportunities, those are the principles we operate by.","During the quarter, we announced that KML had reached an agreement with Pembina Pipeline Corporation where Pembina would acquire all of the common equity of KML including KMI's 70% interest, and that KMI would sell the U.S. portion of the Cochin pipeline to Pembina for $1.546 billion. The closing of the transactions are cross conditioned and closing remains on track for a late Q4 this year or first quarter 2020.","Consistent with the principles I just stated, KMI expects to use its proceeds to reduce debt to maintain our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 4.5 times and use remaining proceeds to invest in attractive projects and\/or to opportunistically repurchase KMI shares. And we said -- as we said when we announced the transaction, initially the proceeds will be used to reduce net debt before being put to these investments for repurchases.","Other milestones for the quarter. We placed the first unit of our Elba Island Liquefaction Facility in service on September 30. We were delayed here obviously and that has been a drag on our financial performance as you'll hear from Kim and David, but unit one is in service along with a balance of plant, meaning that we are now earning 70% of the project revenues.","And when you count also the facilities that we own at the 100% level to KMI's share specifically, it's about 80% of the total project revenues, both the joint venture as well as the facilities that we own 100%.","The remaining nine units are on the island and we are expected to place three more in service this year -- three more in service this year with the remaining six coming online next year in the first half of the year.","We also placed Gulf Coast Express or GCX in service in September. This project was a few days early. It's full. We need another one. The market needs another one. And that brings me to our 2 BCF a day Permian Highway Pipeline Project. That project is progressing well. We have about 85% of the right-of-way acquired and currently expect that we're going to timely acquire the easements we need.","We've also made good progress on the permitting front. However, we are still obtaining some of the regulatory authorizations that we need and that has progressed a little more slowly than what we put in our plan, what our plan -- project plan contemplated. That means in order to do efficient construction, we'll kick-off the construction a little bit later and that means that instead of a fourth quarter 2020 in service, we currently anticipate early 2021.","Both of our Permian Gas Pipeline projects are fully subscribed under long-term contracts that generate attractive returns and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipelines, as on a combined basis they bring 4 BCF a day incrementally to a system that moves about 5 BCF a day today.","Those projects bring opportunities for downstream expansion. In fact two LNG facilities, Texas Gulf Coast power, industrial and petchem demand and in fact, our backlog includes about $325 million to expand and improve connectivity along our Texas Intrastate pipeline network in order to enable us to place the incremental volumes that will be hitting our system and are now hitting our system.","We are currently -- we are still working with customers on a third 2 BCF a day pipeline called Permian Pass. This is a work in progress. It's not in the backlog at this point. And since we reported on this on the second quarter call, the commercial activity has slowed, but it continues. It slowed as a result of some producer retrenchment in their Permian activities. We believe the pipeline is needed, but it may not be needed quite as soon as we were expecting three months ago.","With a total of three new 2 BCF a day projects coming online over the 2019 to 2021 period, both of ours as well as the third-party pipeline. The Permian Pass Pipeline may not be needed in 2022.","In the meantime, we're continuing to work with customers and potential partners and believe the long-term dynamics of needed gas takeaway capacity out of the Permian Basin and our extensive pipeline network in Texas put us in a good position.","These Permian projects demonstrate us taking advantage of a very positive situation for our business. There's large supply growth in Texas and large demand growth in Texas. We can bridge the two and connect to our Premier Texas Intrastate pipeline network on the Gulf Coast and stay entirely within the State of Texas, where we have more commercial flexibility.","As we pointed out at the conference, 70% of natural gas demand growth between now and 2030 is projected to be in Louisiana and Texas, and our systems are well-positioned to benefit from that.","As we said last quarter, we believe we have FERC's 501-G process largely behind us with the settlements we did on TGP and EPNG and several other of our systems. The outcomes were hard to predict, when we were putting our budget together for 2019, so we did not project them in the 2019 budget.","However, as we said when we announced -- or when we came out in January, if we got these things done, it would be a positive to the long-term value of our networks as it would help us resolve rate risk. We feel even more strongly about it, or I feel even more strongly about that statement sitting here today.","The last two Kinder Morgan pipelines with pending 501-G filings are on tomorrow's FERC meeting agenda, both of those systems are currently under rate moratoria, which the commission has been honoring. Again notwithstanding the headwind to 2019, we are delighted to have the 501-G risk largely behind us.","Finally, on our backlog, the backlog fell quarter-to-quarter and now stands at $4.1 billion. That's primarily because we placed Elba Unit one and GCX two of our largest products in the backlog in service at the end of the quarter. We remain -- we will remain disciplined here. We seek returns that are well above our cost of capital in order to deploy capital.","We believe based on our historical experience and on the size of our network and the market dynamics at play, particularly in natural gas that we'll continue to provide the opportunity to invest in $2 billion to $3 billion a year in attractive return expansion projects.","But importantly, if we don't find that much in new opportunities, we are not going to force it. We have other opportunities to deliver value to our shareholders and we expect to maintain our discipline. We will maintain our discipline.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Okay. Thanks Steve. I sound like a broken record, but natural gas had another outstanding quarter, it was up 8% this quarter. Natural gas demand this year expected to increase by approximately 4 BCF a day over 2018. And so it's been the case all year, this growth is driving volume increases on our pipes.","Transport volumes in our transmission pipes is how we refer to our large diameter pipes increased by approximately 4.15 BCF a day or 13%. This marks the seventh quarter in a row on which volume exceeded the comparable prior period by 10% or more.","So, if you look on our system to see where these volumes showed up, EPNG volumes were up just under 1.2 Bcf a day, primarily due to increased Permian volumes and California storage refill.","TGP volumes were up 700 a day due to expansion projects. Kinder Morgan Louisiana volumes were up approximately 680 million cubic feet a day due to LNG exports. So, overall, for Kinder Morgan, deliveries for LNG exports were approximately 2.5 Bcf a day. That's an increase of almost 2 Bcf over the third quarter of 2018.","CIG volumes were up 585 million cubic feet a day due to increased DJ production and coal to gas switching. GCX started flowing volumes in August and went into service at the end of September, so averaged about 325 million cubic feet a day over the quarter. GCX is currently full flowing 2 Bcf a day. And then rig volumes were up approximately 250 million cubic feet a day due to increased DJ and Powder River Basin production.","On the gathering assets, volumes were up 12% or 350 million cubic feet a day, primarily driven by higher volumes in the Haynesville and in the Eagle Ford. Overall, natural gas wellhead volumes out of the key basins we serve, continues to increase. Permian Natural Gas Wellhead volumes increased 22% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2018. Haynesville increased 22%, Bakken increased 20% and the Eagle Ford increased 30%.","Our product segment was also up nicely in the quarter. Here we saw increased on our -- nice increases in our refined products business, primarily on SFPP due to higher average tariff and lower expenses. Refined product volumes were up just under 1% across our pipes versus the EIA numbers which were down approximately 1.3%.","Our crude and condensate business was essentially flat. Contributions from our Bakken asset were offset by reduced contributions from KMCC. As has been the case all year, increased volumes on KMCC were more than offset by lower rate. Overall, crude and condensate volumes were up about 4% in the quarter.","Terminals business was down about 1% in the quarter. The liquids business accounts for about 80% of that segment. And it had nice increases coming from expansion projects. The largest was from our baseline terminal expansion project in Edmonton. However, these increases were more than offset by the increased lease expense at our Edmonton South terminal, which became a third-party obligation post the Trans Mountain sale and a variety of smaller items.","We added about 400,000 barrels of tankage versus the third quarter of 2018. Our baseline project in Canada was the largest addition. Total leasable capacity is now over 89 million barrels. I'd also point out that we have taken Staten Island out of service and removed those barrels from all periods in our volume highlights.","Gasoline and distillate volumes, which don't have a material impact on our business given our contract structure, but do give some insight into the underlying fundamentals of our business. We're up nicely in Houston and the New York Harbor. Our bulk business was up modestly and bulk volumes were down approximately 6% due to lower coal and pet coke volumes.","Finally, our CO2 segment was down in the quarter, primarily due to lower commodity prices, but also due to lower crude and NGL volumes and higher power prices.","Our net realized crude oil price was down $8.50 per barrel approximately. NGL prices were down approximately $15 per barrel. Net crude oil production was down approximately 7%, primarily due to lower production across all of our fields.","However, at Yates, timing on the sales of the crude produced during the period is skewing the numbers. And at SACROC we did had some field wide maintenance, which impacted performance. We adjusted for these items. Production was down approximately 4.5%.","We expect free cash flow from the segment that's DCF plus expansion CapEx to be approximately $350 million for 2019, which is approximately $30 million better than our budget. This improvement versus budget is due to lower capital expenditures primarily because we elected not to proceed with Phase 3 at Tall Cotton as it did not meet our return requirements.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Michels","David Michels","All right. Thanks, Kim. Today we're declaring a dividend of $0.25 per share, the same as last quarter and in line with our budget to declare $1 per share for the full year of 2019, which is a 25% increase over the $0.80 per share that we declare for 2018. KMI's adjusted earnings per share and DCF per share both grew from last year's third quarter. We generated DCF per share of $0.50, which is two times or approximately $570 million in excess of the declared dividend.","In addition to the quarterly performance, our press release provides an update to our 2019 outlook. We are now expecting to end the year with adjusted EBITDA of about 3% below our budget and DCF slightly below our budget. Two discrete items that contributed to the variance were; one, the delay we experienced in placing our Elba Island facility in service; and the 501-G settlements.","The Elba delay while disappointing is largely behind us now. Now that we're recognizing majority of the revenues for that project just as Steve mentioned. And the 501-G resolution, while it wasn't in our budget was a positive outcome for Kinder Morgan.","So, moving on to our quarterly results. As you can see, we are using our updated format for earnings, so we hope you find this to be an improved presentation of our financials. I'll start with our GAAP performance then I'll move on to our non-GAAP performance. Revenues were down 9% from the third quarter of 2018, but the decline in cost of sales more than offset that lower revenue amount, meaning gross margin actually improved from the prior period.","Some of that gross margin benefit came from non-cash losses that we experienced in the third quarter of 2018, which we treat as certain items and exclude from our non-GAAP metrics. Excluding certain items, gross margin was in line period-over-period. Net income available to common stockholders was down $187 million or 27% due largely to a gain on the sale of our Trans Mountain Pipeline, which we took during the third quarter of 2018 and is also treated as a certain item.","In our materials, we call net income available to common shareholders adjusted for certain items, adjusted earnings. Our adjusted earnings were up $39 million or 8% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 for the quarter, up $0.01 or 5% from the prior period. And that includes the additional shares that resulted from the conversion of our preferred equity securities to common shares in October of last year.","Moving on to our DCF performance. Natural gas was up $85 million or 8% for the quarter. We saw greater performance versus last year across multiple assets. Excess interest rates benefited from the GCX commissioning and in-service, EPNG was up, driven by Permian supply growth, which more than offset the unfavorable impact that it experience from the 501-G rate case impacts.","TGP had increased contributions from multiple expansion projects placed in-service. Cochin had increased contributions from higher volume and rate. Kinder Morgan, Louisiana pipeline was up due to the Sabine Pass expansion.","For our products terminals and CO2 segments, Kim touched on the main drivers behind our financial performance there. Kinder Morgan Canada was down $32 million, as a result of the sale of Trans Mountain Pipeline last year.","G&A expense was higher by $14 million, due to higher non-cash pension expenses, as well as lower overhead capitalized to our projects. And those are partially offset in G&A by lower G&A resulting from our Trans Mountain sale. So that explains the main changes and adjusted EBITDA, which was $23 million, or 1% below Q3 2018.","Moving below EBITDA, interest expense was $21 million lower, driven by our lower debt balance. Sustaining capital was $21 million lower versus Q3 2018, mainly due to the timing of pipeline integrity work. We budgeted to spend more in sustaining capital for the year, this year full year versus last year. And we're still forecasted to do that, though we are trending to come in favorable to our budget for the full year.","Preferred stock dividends were down $39 million as a result of the conversion of our mandatory convertible securities last year. Other items, our unfavorable $22 million driven by a larger cash contribution to our pension plan this year versus last, so total DCF of $1.140 billion, is up $47 million or 4%.","To summarize the main drivers, greater contributions from our natural gas and product segments, lower preferred stock dividends, lower interest expense in sustaining capital, partially offset by lower contributions from our CO2 segment, driven by lower commodity prices, the sale of Trans Mountain Pipeline and a higher cash pension contribution.","DCF per share of $0.50 was up $0.01 or 2% from last year. The same drivers as DCF, but that includes the impact from the incremental shares issued as a result of our preferred stock version.","For the full year versus our budget, EBITDA as I mentioned is expected to be 3% below and the back the drivers of that variance include lower oil and NGL prices as well as lower volumes impacting our CO2 segment, the Elba delay in the 501-G settlements, partially offset by greater contributions from EPNG, resulting from strong Permian supply growth.","Full year DCF is expected to be slightly below budget, due to the same items impacting EBITDA as well as the benefit of favorable interest expense and an add back of non-cash pension expenses.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 4.7 times debt-to-EBITDA, slightly higher than the 4.5 times at the beginning of the year 2019 and we forecast to end the year with leverage a 4.6 times, which is the same year-end level we announced last quarter. Adjusted net debt ended the quarter at $35.2 billion, up about $380 million from last quarter, and an increase of $1.073 billion from year-end 2018.","To reconcile the change in the quarter, we generated DCF of $1.14 billion. We spent about $700 million on growth capital and contributions to our joint ventures. We paid out $570 million of dividends and we had a working capital use of approximately $250 million, mainly interest expense payments in the quarter, so that gets you to close to the $380 million increase in debt for the quarter.","For the full year, we generated DCF of $3.639 billion. We spent $2.2 billion on growth capital and joint venture contributions. We paid out dividends of $1.59 billion. We paid taxes on the Trans Mountain sale of $340 million and we had a working capital use of about $550 million largely interest payments also being the largest use. And that gets you to the main pieces of the $1.073 billion increase in adjusted net debt for the year.","I'll now turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. And we're going to update you on KML, progress on the transaction, as well as the financial results stats.","Rich Kinder","Thanks, Steve. Before a few brief comments on the numbers, I'll update you on where we stand on the pending sale of KML to Pembina. Consistent with previous comments, we still expect the deal will close either late in the current quarter or in the first quarter of next year. At this point, we have received early termination of the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino review period, which is a condition to close. The remaining conditions to close include KML shareholder and related court approvals and other regulatory approvals including approval by the Canadian Competition Bureau, which we expect will be the longest lead item.","With respect to shareholder approval, the common and preferred shareholder meetings are scheduled for December 10th. As a reminder, while there will be a vote of the preferred shareholders on a proposal to exchange KML preferred, for Pembina preferred as part of the transaction, closing of the transaction itself is not dependent upon that vote or any approval of the preferred shareholders.","With respect to approval by the Canadian Competition Bureau, we are proactively engaged with Pembina and the Competition Bureau to respond to requests for information in order to facilitate the bureau's review.","Now moving toward the results. Today, the KML Board declared a dividend for the third quarter of 0.1625 per restricted voting share or $0.65 annualized, which is consistent with previous guidance. Earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations for the third quarter are $0.08 and that is derived from approximately $16.6 million of income from continuing operations, which is the same as net income. Income from continuing operations is down approximately $5.6 million versus the same quarter in 2018.","Looking at the largest drivers of that variance, revenue increased across most of KML's assets and was led by the contribution from the Base Line Tank and Terminal assets, being fully online and an increase in Cochin -- from Cochin due to the indexing of rates and the timing of incremental volumes in 2019.","However, the increase in revenue was more than offset by higher G&A, mostly associated with the cost of selling KML and lower interest income due to the non-recurrence of income on the Trans Mountain sale proceeds received in 2018. There were several other smaller moving pieces including slightly higher O&M and DD&A and lower income tax expense.","Total DCF from continuing operations for the quarter is $47.8 million, which is up approximately $8.8 million from the comparable period in 2018. Beyond the items, I've already mentioned, cash taxes were favorable by $9.8 million. That $9.8 million is driven by a refund received in the third quarter of 14.7, representing the overpayment of cash taxes for 2018 netted against $5 million of installments made for 2019.","Looking forward, as we said in the release, we expect our results for the year to be consistent with our budget of approximately $213 million in EBITDA and approximately $109 million in DCF. Finally, as we said in our release, due to the transaction and the lead up to it following the announcement of our normal course issuer bid buyback, we will not utilize any of that program at this point.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay. We're ready to answer questions on both entities. And as we've been doing here recently, we're going to ask that you limit your questions per person to one question with a follow-up. But if you\u2019ve got additional unanswered questions, get back in the queue and we will get back to you. All right, Brittany, if you'd open it up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Your line is now open.","Steve Kean","Good afternoon.","Colton Bean","Good afternoon. So, just given the backlog that you all have in place today, is there a scenario where operating cash flow is sufficient to fund both the dividend and the capital program in 2020? I guess, as a follow on, when would you expect to make decisions regarding proceeds from Cochin and PBL shares?","Steve Kean","Okay. So, we haven't started our 2020 budget process yet. We were taking that up here right quick, but we -- so we won't know the final answer to that question. I mean this year with the dividend at the level that it was, we had what we call a self-funding gap of what's projected to be about $100 million, which means we've almost entirely funded our capital program and our JV contributions of around $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion and the dividend out of the cash that we generate.","Obviously, with dividend going up next year, that could be a little tighter. But until we know exactly what we\u2019ve got in the capital plan for next year, we don't have a specific answer. I think it's safe to say we will be largely self-funding our CapEx along with paying the increased dividend next year.","On the timing, so we'll have the Cochin -- well, when the Cochin proceeds come in, we should -- one of us should probably mention, as we said when we announced the transaction, the Cochin proceeds by themselves would take our projected net debt-to-EBITDA to 4.4 times versus the 4.6 times that we talked about earlier.","We'd expect that -- again as I've said, we would hold that on the balance sheet if you will and wait for the right opportunity. And when it comes to the right opportunity, we'll be looking at capital projects that we have very attractive turns -- returns at well above our cost of capital or at share repurchases.","The share repurchases we will do opportunistically and not programmatically. And so, we're not talking about specific prices at which we would transact or anything like that, but we'll have the proceeds available.","When it comes to the Pembina shares in particular, of course, we would expect to convert those to cash at some point. We represent -- the proceeds represent less than 5% of Pembina's trading outstanding stock. So, we think that we can convert those shares into cash in a very non-disruptive way, and we don't have to be in a hurry to do so. And then we'll deploy the capital in share repurchases as I said opportunistically.","Colton Bean","Got it, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-on. And so, understanding that there were impacts from field maintenance in the quarter for the EOR business, should we expect any impact at base decline rates from the reductions in the capital program?","Steve Kean","I think that at current -- we believe that at current prices, if you think about the smaller fields, Goldsmith, Katz, and Tall Cotton, we would probably -- we're going to be managing those for free cash flow not expecting to invest considerable capital in them. That can change if oil prices change. But for right now that would be our plan on those, and we will focus our attention on SACROC and Yates. And that's where most of the oil is anyway, having most of the production in any case. And so, I would expect to see declines in the smaller fields and then we'll see what projects are available to us at the return thresholds that we've set in the two larger fields.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is now open.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good afternoon, everyone.","Steve Kean","Good afternoon.","Shneur Gershuni","Steve, you had previously guided to 2.3 -- $2 billion to $3 billion worth of CapEx as kind of -- the run rate number that you've sort of been talking about. And I realize you're not through your capital program at this point or the valuation of your capital program for 2020 at this point. But I was wondering if you can talk about what drivers would bring you to the lower end versus the upper end as you contemplate the backlog?","You mentioned discipline earlier. Does the slowing of commercial discussions around the third Permian pipeline potentially bring CapEx to the lower end? I'm just wondering if you can give us sort of a little bit of color of what -- how both things will move around between the upper and the lower bound of your CapEx than you've previously given?","Steve Kean","Yeah and the short answer to your question on the Permian Pass is that yeah that would bring it toward the lower end until it ultimately gets sanctioned. So, if you think about where these projects are likely to come from, clearly we've got some in terminals and refined products, but the lion's share of the project opportunities as we look down the road are the things that aren't in the backlog right now are in the natural gas sector. And they relate to additional Permian takeaway capacity as well as feeding LNG facilities in the second wave of LNG.","And as I said, mostly concentrated on -- in Texas and Louisiana and so it's the timing of those project sanctions or sanctioning FIDs that will drive our capital -- our backlog and our capital budgets in the years ahead.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And then a quick clarification, you just mentioned that on a pro forma basis, this is already Colton\u2019s question before -- on a pro forma basis for the KML-Cochin sale that you would technically end the year at 4.4 times versus 4.6 times, did that not include the sale of the Pembina shares? Is that just on the cash that's coming in and the 4.4 times would in theory be lower if you sold those shares as well too?","Steve Kean","Yeah. That's just on the Cochin cash proceeds, and it does assume an end of the year close, which is not a certainty. As we've said, we maybe able to close as soon as the end of this quarter or early 2020, but if you make that assumption of a close in this year and the use of -- and the receipt of the $1.546 billion of U.S. Cochin proceeds alone that's where you get that number.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi. Good afternoon. Just wanted to pick up on the CO2 side, that was a bit low, our estimates there. I was just wondering how much CapEx does it take to keep the production flat there or the 4.5% decline rate should we expect that to continue? Any thoughts you can provide there?","Steve Kean","Yeah. So, we don't invest in our CO2 business based on what investment level would be required to keep production flat or to grow production in aggregate. The way we invest the capital is, if the capital that we're investing and the oil that we expect to free up and sell as a result of it, if that produces a return, that clears our return criteria, then we invest. And so, we've had times when SACROC's been up year-over-year. We've had times certainly when it's been down. But we continue to find things to do at SACROC. It's just that we don't invest specifically to maintain production.","As I said earlier, I mean, I think you can expect that without capital investment in the smaller fields, you would tend to see a decline there. And as I said, we're going to maintain capital discipline there and we will continue to look for the opportunities to make sense at SACROC and Yates.","Jeremy Tonet","Got it. And then, going over to the M&A opportunities you're seeing, it seems like there was indications of interest in some of your assets at the north of 13 times. So I was just wondering, if you could provide any more color there. Is this kind of in the FERC-regulated assets like citrus? Is this on GMP? Or kind of what's more of the thought process there? If you can monetized that something better than what you trade at, is there anything holding you back from doing that?","Rich Kinder","Well, Jeremy, we're not government on specific expression of interest that we've had. I made that point simply to again drive home as I think the Cochin transaction does also, that there's interest in individual assets at multiple of EBITDA well above where KMI as a whole is trading.","Operator","And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Spiro Dounis","Hey, good afternoon. Maybe just following up on the M&A question. I won't ask you to may be point out specific assets. But just maybe help us think about, where the interest is coming from. Obviously, we've seen interest from private equity in the space, but now also, some strategic deals are getting done.","So just curious, as you think about the -- who the potential buyers could be? Can you describe them? And is there any room or interest for you to may be sale a portion of an asset, while retaining some of the operational control of it?","Rich Kinder","We would certainly entertain selling a portion of an asset and maintaining operational control. That's a good fit with what I believe Steve and the team are doing to continue to position KMI as really good operators in every respect from safety to efficiency.","And so, that's certainly something we entertain. We're not going to comment further on where the interest is from. But I think all of you know that there is a lot of money out there looking for a home in the midstream area of the energy section.","Spiro Dounis","Yes, understood. And then just on Permian Pass, I appreciate the color around the customer side. Just curious, if you're seeing JV partner start to show up or express any levels of interest early on. And just a quick tag along on Permian Highway and sorry if I missed it, but is there any incremental cost associated with the delay? And is that going to be spread across the partners equally?","Steve Kean","Yes. Taking the last one first. Yes, moderately, I would say. And, yes, it's borne by the project and all of its investors. On Permian Pass, there's definitely interest from people, shippers as well as partners or prospective partners. What I was trying to get across there is that, particularly there's no secret, as you saw, how people came out and laid out there capital plans in the producing sector, following -- as part of second quarter earnings. The growth is still there. It's maybe not growing on the same slope. And so, that naturally implies, I think, still a need, both, still need for the pipeline project, but perhaps a later in-service date and a later FID.","Operator","And our next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Keith Stanley","Hi. Good afternoon. Curious, just updated views on acquisitions as part of the growth strategy, just you\u2019re going to have a lot more financial flexibility next year, equity currencies maybe a little better on relative terms. Just updated thoughts there?","Steve Kean","It's really no update, in the sense that we are always looking to see what makes sense. What makes sense particularly in our sector and -- but those things are very hard to project, very hard to predict and call your shots on, but we continue to leave the offense on the field.","Keith Stanley","Okay. And so I just have one follow-up on the asset sale side as well. How would you assess asset sales from here? It's a little different this time around with leverage already at your target, maybe not a clear use of sales proceeds besides buybacks. So just how would you assess asset sales given where you are financially now?","Steve Kean","I mean, I think you look at, we would look at it the same way we'd look at any other sales proceeds. The first use of those proceeds would be to make sure that we have maintained leverage target that we've achieved. And so that's first.","And then from there, it's again probably initially sits on the balance sheet and then opportunistically share repurchases or to fund our capital program. It's the same kind of order of operations that we\u2019ve talked about on KML proceeds and other proceeds.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Tristan Richardson","Good afternoon. Appreciate all your comments on the stringent project approval criteria and returning cash to shareholders. When you look at 2020 marking the end of your multi-year outlook period, do you guys plan on outlining a multi-year plan similar -- in a similar way or do you think about this kind of on an annual basis now?","Steve Kean","I think, well, first of all, like if you're asking specifically about the dividend, that's a Board decision and we will be evaluating that. As we've said before, I think the right long-term assumption is to assume a dividend that grows in line, more in line with the growth in the underlying business, but I wouldn't expect a multi-year program.","Rich Kinder","Now I think we've been very clear when we gave the three-year plan and we've achieved all those objectives as we promised. And after we pay out the $1.25 next year, during the year the Board will look at what the opportunities are for the future. But I think Steve is absolutely right. We're looking at this year-to-year and not set out a multi-year plan.","Steve Kean","But the principles will be multi-year, which is a strong balance sheet, investment in attractive returning projects and returning value to shareholders through share repurchases or dividends. Those principles will \u2013 and having a well covered dividend, those principles will occur.","Rich Kinder","Exactly right.","Tristan Richardson","Very helpful. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up on PHP, talked about being most of the way there on regulatory and right-of-way permitting, et cetera. The sort of the largest pinch points over the areas of the regulatory process that brought the delays, do you see those as sort of in the rearview mirror now in this last stretch such that they gave you that comfort to talk about the early 2021 date?","Steve Kean","Yeah. So, good point. We've made a lot of progress lately in getting permits as well as getting our right-of-way done and where we\u2019ve had to proceed to eminent domain, it\u2019s something we avoid using. But as well as the second quarter court decision that we got that cleared the way for the project to proceed in large part. We still have some more work to do. We don't see anything in that work that we have to do on the permitting front that is in anyway insurmountable. In fact, we think we've already done that work. It needs to be processed now and ruled upon. But we made our plans assuming that, that process would conclude and this was our projection, not an agency's production. But we assumed things would conclude earlier, and it's taking a little longer. But I think being thoroughly reviewed thoroughly done.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ujjwal Pradhan from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.","Ujjwal Pradhan","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. First one on me, just in terms of thinking about your credit rating and the leverage target, given that you have a clear line of sight here into the actual proceeds and growing free cash flow, do you see any potential to lower your leverage target and maybe aim for a high BBB rating and maybe have a higher age accretion? And how your conversations have been with rating agencies in this regard? And then I have a follow-up.","Steve Kean","Okay. Well, I'll start and then ask David or Anthony to fill \u2013 or Kim to fill in. But I think we feel good being a BBB class and getting the upgrade from BBB minus. We do evaluate whether it makes sense to improve on that target and that evaluation has so far shown that we really get very, very little cost of capital benefit and in fact, the extra deleveraging that we would do, would forestall opportunities to create shareholder value to an extent that we don't think is warranted. But David?","David Michels","Well, I'll just add that in terms of our \u2013 I wouldn't add anything more to that part of your answer to what Steve just said -- provided. But I would say, in terms of recent rating agency conversations that we've had. We just got upgraded by all three just within the last year. They went to a thorough analysis on upgrading us. It's very difficult to get upgraded. So they take a very cautious approach. So I think we're in real good standing with them \u2013 with our current leverage target and our current leverage.","Ujjwal Pradhan","Got you. And Rich in your introductory comments, you talked about the environmental positives of your business especially on the natural gas side. But one area, I think was missing was your CO2 business and their related EOR although a smaller scale versus your other business. Given that you are trapping carbon dioxide underground in the process, do you think your operation qualify for ESG eligibility and any governmental incentives? And we have seen one of your competitors in the business talk about it at length, so just wanted to get some of your thoughts there?","Rich Kinder","So, you're right. We capture CO2 and we put it in the ground and it stays there. And we get valuable oil out as a consequence of that. That has been primarily geologically sourced CO2 really exclusively geologically sourced CO2. There are opportunities to potentially capture man-made CO2 and there are some tax credits to help support that activity. So far in any sizable way, we have not found it to be economic and have not found the sources of available CO2 from say, large ethanol plants, for example, to be of sufficient -- to be numerous and often of a high enough quantity for us to take full advantage -- to take advantage of that opportunity. But if you think about the long term and you think that at some point, CO2 sequestration capacity is going to be valuable, because of the carbon tax or something else, certainly, it's something that we know how to do.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Christine Cho","Good evening, everyone. So I wanted to start on, I guess, follow-up on the capital allocation. When we think about what you could potentially do in stock buybacks, should we assume that leverage stays at your targeted 4.5 times?","So, like for next year, that it looks like may be your CapEx shakes out light and your net debt falls below that, that we should think that you would likely buyback stock? And what are the puts and takes to why you would maybe want to take leverage lower or higher than that? Do you think higher with potential M&A opportunities?","Steve Kean ","We don't anticipate increasing leverage in order to repurchase shares when that's -- when it\u2019s above our target, okay? So, we expect to maintain our target as we use our share repurchase program. And as I said before, we -- the share repurchases would come opportunistically. And as I've said on that KML proceeds, we\u2019d likely initially let those be on the balance sheet and then we'll look for the right opportunities to use it. But we're not telegraphing specific metrics or pricing that we're looking for.","Christine Cho","Okay. And would you potentially take your leverage higher if you saw a good M&A opportunity and the rating agencies were okay with it? ","Steve Kean ","If the rating agencies were okay with it, yes, that's an if, but I think it's the way -- and this is purely theoretical, okay?","Christine Cho","Right","Steve Kean ","But the way that would work is, if you saw yourself having a very clear path back to these metrics and a rapid one and one that you could confidently execute on. And I think it would only be in those circumstances.","Rich Kinder","But let me just say that, obviously, it took us a good amount of time and a lot of work to get where we are now. And we would certainly -- that's a fundamental part of our philosophy is to maintain a strong balance sheet. And we can speculate all you want about what might happen in M&A, but let me just say that the Board is very committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and that will certainly be a really big factor in any decision we make.","And to amplify what Steve said, again, as we've said so many times over the last three years, there are four things we can do with the money and all of them benefit our shareholders. I think, we've shown by increasing the dividend, we're returning real value to the shareholders. If you take $1.25 dividend on the stock price, it's turning the bar 20, its equivalent return if you look one year out.","We have the ability to, as Steve said, substantially fund our own capital projects. We have the ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and we have the ability, at some point, opportunistically, to buy back shares. So, I can assure you that the Board is going to make decisions that are in the best interest of shareholders here. We have a large amount of insider ownership on the Board. So, we're certainly going to look out for what's best for our shareholders.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you very much. Have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. All participants may disconnect at this time."],"12301":["Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 18, 2012  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Richard D.

[Operator Instructions] This call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect now. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin, sir.","Richard D. Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Holly. This is the Kinder Morgan earnings call and, as usual, we'll be making statements that may fall within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Now that we have closed the El Paso merger, we'll be talking about 3 entities: KMI, Kinder Morgan, Inc.; KMP, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners; and EPB, Enron -- I mean, El Paso Pipeline Partners. In addition, of course, there's a fourth security, KMR, which is the equivalent of KMP, but is -- pays its dividends in FICC and is suitable for investors who do not want to hold an MLP.","Kim will take you through the financial details, and there's a good bit of noise there resulting from the El Paso merger and from the FTC mandated sale. But I think there's a strong fundamental story in most respects. For those of you new to this call, and to the Kinder Morgan philosophy, we're all about generating cash and paying out that cash to shareholders in distributions or dividends. So the real news here, I think, is that all 3 entities increased their dividends or distributions for the second quarter.","KMI increased its dividend to $0.35. Now that's up 17% since the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate dividending $1.40 for the year 2012. KMP and KMR raised their distribution to $1.23 per quarter. That's up 7% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate distributing $4.98 for the year at KMP and KMR. EPB increased its dividend to $0.55. That's up 15% from the second quarter of 2011, and we anticipate paying dividends of $2.25 for calendar year 2012.","Now let me talk about each of the 3 entities briefly, before I turn it over to Kim. At KMI, the cash available for dividends this quarter was $307 million. That's up 83% from the $168 million in the second quarter of 2011. If you look at it on the basis of cash available for dividends per share, it's $0.36 this quarter versus $0.24 in the second quarter of 2011. And I might add that for the full year 2012 at KMI, we expect to generate over $1.3 billion in cash available for dividends.","Obviously, the most important thing that occurred during the second quarter this year was the completion of the El Paso acquisition on May 24. As we promised, in conjunction with that acquisition, we sold off the E&P assets of El Paso for approximately $7.2 billion. We had originally targeted producing $350 million of cost savings per year. We now expect that number to be north of $400 million per year.","We said we would drop down significant assets to EPB, and we did that just prior to the close by dropping down the remaining 14% of Colorado Interstate and all of the Cheyenne Plains Pipeline. We expect to drop down 100% of Tennessee, TGP, and 50% of El Paso Natural Gas to KMP during this third quarter. And I might add that we really believe that TGP, obviously, has just a unique footprint in the Marcellus and Utica. We expect to complete the FTC mandated sales of certain KMP Rockies pipelines during the third quarter also.","It's early in the game. We've only had these assets for a little less than 2 months. But so far, the assimilation is going well. We're seeing real upside possibilities from the assets, and we think we've inherited, most importantly, a great number of really good people. There are some profound effects that this merger has and, just to give you a couple of them, it now makes gas pipelines and storage across all 3 of the entities about 60% of all the earnings before DD&A. So we've become much more of a gas pipeline company, obviously.","And then secondly, by putting all these companies together, if you look at enterprise value on a combined basis, at yesterday's close, the total enterprise value of these 3 entities is right at $100 billion. So this is quite a company we've assembled, with a footprint that I think is going to pay enormous dividends for years to come.","Now let me turn to KMP. There the distributable cash flow increased by 13% to $366 million. Of course, the key thing for us is distributable cash flow per unit, and that is up to $1.07 versus $1.01 in Q2 of 2011. All the segments were positive in comparison to the second quarter of 2011 in terms of earnings before DD&A prior to certain items, with the exception of the Products Pipeline segment, which was burdened by lower rates on SFPP as a result of FERC and CPUC decisions and settlements.","If you look at how the underlying business has performed, and I think sometimes we're kind of a microcosm of the economy, I can give you some interesting statistics. On the refined products volumes, we were off 0.9% in terms of throughput for the second quarter of 2012 compared to the same period a year ago. And coincidentally, that's exactly equal to the EIA numbers recently published for the second quarter.","In terms of NGL volumes, our performance was much better. We were up 27%, largely through increased volumes on our Cochin and Cypress systems. We increased our biofuels volumes, and we're still handling about 30% of all the ethanol consumed in the United States. If you look at some of our terminal activities, we continue to benefit from strong coal export volumes, offset somewhat by weaker domestic coal volumes. Overall, coal volumes in our Terminals group was up 12%.","Our petcoke volumes were also up 12%. Steel was up a much more modest 2%. And I think, returning to coal for just a minute, we believe that for the full year 2012, we will handle over 20 million tons of coal for export at our 4 export terminals, 2 on the Houston Ship Channel, 1 on the Mississippi, south of New Orleans; and the other in the Newport News, Virginia area. And that's about 20% of all the coal exported from the United States anticipated for calendar year 2012. The throughput on our liquids terminals was also positive, up about 5%.","Turning to our Natural Gas segment, natural gas transport volumes were up 6% compared to the quarter a year ago. Natural gas sales volumes, virtually all in Texas, were up 12% compared to the second quarter of 2011. And the big drivers for that 12% increase were increased power demand and increased exports to Mexico. But as we look across all of our pipelines, the power demand is very high. We're setting records both for the month and year-to-date in terms of gas delivery to the power demand on both Tennessee and on the Southern Natural Gas systems.","Now all that sounds pretty rosy, but life is never that way. And let me just say that not all is rosy in terms of volumes of natural gas throughput. Clearly, as you can imagine, the volumes are below budget on our dry gas activities, particularly in the Haynesville play, what we call our KinderHawk facility. But I will say that our EBITDA there is still nicely above the EBITDA in our acquisition model when we bought the second half of KinderHawk from Petrohawk back in the middle of 2011. So we're below plan in terms of volumes and EBITDA but above our acquisition model in terms of EBITDA.","We're also seeing some producer delays in getting Eagle Ford production into our pipeline systems. I think largely this is the inability of producers to get equipment delivered on a timely basis, and just the sheer volume of activity there, I think, is creating some bottlenecks. But volumes are certainly there. We have long-term throughput contracts. But in some cases, the ramp-up is going more slowly in terms of getting the volumes to us than we would have anticipated it would be.","In our CO2 segment, the production volumes are pretty good. SACROC is up 1,600 barrels a day from quarter 1 of 2012 and about flat to quarter 2 of 2011. Cash volumes are obviously way up above the second quarter of 2011 as that particular field ramps up, but still slightly below our plan for the second quarter of 2012.","Gross NGL production is at record levels, and this is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had record levels. So in short, the operations in the CO segment are doing pretty well, and we expect the rest of the year to continue strong from a production standpoint. The headwind in this section, which would come as no news to any of you who follow the midstream energy business, is the deterioration in NGL prices, and they're clearly substantially lower than the numbers we had in the budget, which was based on outlook dating from last November. Now we're not quite as bad as some. We estimate now, we put this in the release, that if the present trends were to hold through the year, our NGL price would be down by about 23%. So we're not as bad as some others because we do have less ethane in our mix. But overall, there's no question that that's a headwind for our CO2 segment.","On the sales and transportation side, demand for CO2 remains strong, and we continue to work to expand our source fields, both in Southwest Colorado and to develop our newest source field, the St. John's field, which is on the Arizona-New Mexico border.","In Canada, the Trans Mountain volumes were up slightly from the second quarter of 2011, and we expect to have those volumes hold in for the rest of the year. Probably the most important development at KMP and perhaps throughout the whole Kinder Morgan family of companies is the tremendous project development that we're seeing. We've made a lot of progress on these projects, and we're now estimating that our project backlog is now approaching $10 billion. The bulk of that is at KMP, but some is in the assets we still hold at KMI and some is in the EPB assets. But a huge backlog of products, and we -- those are already either approved, or we expect to approve them with the board very shortly. And it's money that will be spent not just in 2012, obviously, but over the next 3 or 4 years. All of these projects are backed by long-term contracts with our shippers, which is obviously a critical thing for us.","Now we've detailed the most important of the projects that have been approved in the earnings release, and I won't go through them, but I think they bode very well for future cash flow. Let me just give you a few numbers to remember. Not counting the drop-downs of Tennessee and EPNG, which again we expect to occur this quarter, nor the CapEx associated with those drop-downs, not counting those, we expect KMP to invest about $2.2 billion in expansions and acquisitions this year, up from our original estimate of about $1.5 billion. And remember, that's just for 2012.","If you look at it a little more -- in a little more detail, Terminals alone has approved projects of more than $1.3 billion, and much of that money will be spent in '13 and '14, not just in 2012. In the Products Pipelines, 3 of the projects that we outline in the release, namely the Houston condensate splitter, the Parkway Pipeline and the Cochin Reversal project, those 3 projects alone total almost $700 million in CapEx, most of which will be spent in '13 and '14. And if you add all of the projects that have been approved for the Products Pipelines group, it's more like $800 million.","Now beyond all these projects that are underway and approved and advancing quickly is, of course, the Trans Mountain Expansion project in Canada. We now have contracts with 9 shippers for approximately 510,000 barrels per day for 20 years. That allows us to plan an expansion from the present capacity of 300,000 barrels a day to 750,000 barrels a day. Now there'll be a long regulatory process, although I would add that recent developments have indicated that the Canadian national government is very intent on streamlining that process. But we expect to get this approval, and we expect to spend the $4.1 billion to bring this project to completion.","We think it will be built in the 2015, 2016 time frame, assuming regulatory approval, and be in service sometime in early 2017. Now all these projects, when you count them all up, are just tremendous building blocks for the future, and I think that's what we'll need more than any other single factor to continue growth at all 3 of these entities.","Now turning to EPB, there, the DCF is up 14% to $135 million for the second quarter of 2012. Again, the more key figure is the DCF per unit and is 65% this quarter versus $0.60 a year ago. During the quarter, the most significant single event was the completion of the drop-down that I detailed earlier. But we also completed the third and final phase of Southern Natural Gas's system 3, and that expansion was placed in service in June. All 3 of those phases together resulted in additional capacity on the system of about 375 million cubic feet a day, and that's all subscribed to by the Southern companies for electric generation mode.","From a broader perspective on EPB, we're just starting the process of assimilating these assets, but we're really very encouraged by the step-out expansion opportunities; by opportunities for storage, both in the Southeast and the Rockies; and by potential LNG export opportunities. We think EPB will also benefit from its share of these reduced costs, which we've been able to put into effect across the entire Kinder Morgan companies. So that's an update on where we stand. And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.","Kimberly Allen Dang","Okay. Thanks, Rich. Okay, I'm going to start with the numbers on KMP. I'll do EPB second, and KMI, third. And so looking at the first page of numbers on KMP, the GAAP income statement, we don't think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful. We're going to focus on our calculation of EPS. But a few things I want to point out here, one, we're declaring a distribution today of $1.23. That's up about 7% from the second quarter of last year. The other thing on the GAAP income statement, you will see that there is an incremental loss on the remeasurement of our discounts -- that's the FTC assets -- to adjust them to fair value. That's $327 million. That's noncash. When we go to the DCF calculation, you'll see that we exclude that. However, right above that, you'll see the income from discontinued operations, the $48 million. When we calculate DCF because we still own those assets and we get those cash flows, we include that in our calculation of DCF.","So on the second page, towards the bottom of the page, you can see our DCF before certain items. As Rich mentioned, $366 million in the quarter, up $42 million or 13%. For the 6 months, $828 million, up $122 million. Now just to back up one second, what we're doing in calculating DCF is we're taking GAAP net income before certain items, the primarily -- the primary certain item is the loss on remeasurement that I just mentioned. We're adding back DD&A, including our share of DD&A. We're making some other small adjustments, book cash taxes and some other small adjustments, taking out sustaining CapEx to get us to what our DCF is. So that is $366 million in the quarter. That's about $1.07 per unit. That compares to the distribution that we're declaring today of $1.23. So we have negative coverage in the quarter, which is -- we expected. We told you that, that would be the case, so it's last quarter and it's the time we went over the budget.","For the 6 months, $2.44 of distributable cash flow per unit compared to a distribution of $2.43. So slightly positive on coverage for the 6 months. For the full year, on coverage, what we're expecting is to be at 1x coverage or maybe slightly under that. And I'll go through in a minute as I go through where we are relative to our budget, but that's primarily a function of lower NGL prices and then lower results, operating results from our KinderHawk assets.","So looking back up at the segment, $959 million in segment earnings before DD&A, up $107 million in the quarter, up $257 million year-to-date. The Products Pipelines, as Rich mentioned, down $9 million in the quarter, down $13 million year-to-date on an actual basis. That is primarily a function of the lower rates on Pacific. We do have lower performance on our Transmix business as we had a contract expire there, but that's largely offset by a favorable on Cochin as a result of a settlement with our shippers.","The same factors are driving the year-to-date. With respect to the budget, we're very close to the budget year-to-date. For the year, we expect to end slightly below the budget. Natural Gas segment's up $47 million in the quarter. It's up $103 million year-to-date, and that's a function of the KinderHawk acquisition, the SouthTex acquisition and just favorable results in our trading business and our Fayetteville Express Pipeline, as volumes ramped during 2011.","With respect to our budget year-to-date on Natural Gas, we're below our budget, primarily as a result of KinderHawk. And then as things progressing more slowly in the Eagle Ford as Rich mentioned. For the year, on Natural Gas, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the drop-downs. And so absent the drop-downs, we would expect that we would end below our budget, primarily as a function of KinderHawk.","CO2 business is up $52 million in the quarter. It's up $131 million year-to-date. Obviously, oil price is up. Our oil volumes in the quarter are up about 800 barrels per day, largely as a result of caps. Our NGL volumes are up in the quarter, about 1,100 barrels a day, and then that's slightly offset by lower NGL prices. The same is true for the quarter except for the oil volume is flat. So the same factors, except the oil volume.","Year-to-date, we are below budget on CO2, and that's a function -- oil production is, as I said, about 850 barrels per day below our budget. However, for the full year, given SACROC, the improved performance of SACROC, we're expecting to end pretty close to our production budget. And so for the full year, we're expecting CO2 to come in about 5% below its budget, and that is primarily a factor of lower NGL prices.","Terminals up $17 million in the quarter, up $34 million year-to-date. 80% of that is internal growth in the quarter, primarily higher volumes on our liquids terminals, higher rates and expansions on our liquids terminals, higher coal, export coal volumes and higher petcoke volumes. And the same factors are largely true on the year-to-date basis. Year-to-date, Terminals is on budget. And for the year, we expect them to exceed their budget, primarily due to higher export coal volumes.","Kinder Morgan Canada is flat in the quarter. It's up about $2 million year-to-date. They're slightly exceeding their budget year-to-date, and we expect for the year that they will slightly exceed their budget.","Dropping down to G&A, which is about in the middle of your page, G&A is down $2 million versus -- I'm sorry, is up $2 million versus last year. It's up $10 million versus last year, year-to-date. It's on budget year-to-date. And -- but for the year, we expect it to be above its budget. And we expect to be its -- for it to be above its budget largely as a result of the drop-downs of GDP and EPNG. Absent the drop-downs, we would come in under our budget on G&A, primarily as a function of higher capitalized overhead as capital expenditures have increased to the $2.2 billion that Rich mentioned before.","Interest expense, up $12 million versus the second quarter last year, up $19 million year-to-date. That's primarily a function of the higher balance. Our balance is up about $1.3 billion. Year-to-date, we are favorable to budget as a result of lower rates. For the full year, we expect to be above our budget as a result of the acquisitions. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would expect that interest expense would be favorable versus our budget, also as a function of lower rates.","Sustaining CapEx in the quarter is up $3 million. So higher spending in the quarter than a year ago. It's also up year-to-date. Versus our budget year-to-date, we're actually favorable. We've spent less than we anticipated. Some of that is timing. But for the full year, we expect sustaining capital to be above our budget, and that's also a function of the acquisitions. Our full year forecast does build in the impact of the drop-downs and from KMI, as well as the FTC divestitures. We think we'll be in the range of $55 million higher than our budget. If you strip out the acquisitions, we would come in favorable to budget. Primarily, some has moved -- some of the sustaining CapEx has moved to O&M and then there is a small amount of savings and deferrals.","So that is the DCF for the quarter. I'll move to the balance sheet. The balance sheet -- I'm just going to focus on the debt. $12.6 billion is our net debt in the quarter. That results in a debt to EBITDA of 3.4x. That's down from year end of 3.6x and down from last quarter at 3.5x. We expect to end the year at about 3.9x debt to EBITDA, but that also has all the debt associated with the drop-down transactions and only a partial year of the operating results. So if you pro forma the EBITDA for a full year, so you take out the FTC assets and you put in a full year of TGP and EPNG, we would end the year at 3.7x.","The change in debt for the quarter is about $55 million. For the year-to-date, it's about $223 million. And just to go through the main drivers of that, on the quarter, we had about $730 million of spending. It was $400 million of expansion CapEx, about $300 million of acquisitions and about $35 million of contributions to equity investments.","We issued equity of $578 million. That's KMR. That's KMP at the market. We issued about $300 million in the Midstream transaction. We had a rate case settlement payment of $54 million. We unwound a swap that largely offset that. That was a positive $53 million. Our coverage was negative $56 million and then we had a working capital positive of $157 million. And that is primarily accrued interest.","Year-to-date, $223 million change in debt. We spent a little over $1.1 billion year-to-date. That's about $700 million in expansion, $330 million in acquisitions, the biggest acquisition being the $300 million Midstream acquisition, and about $86 million in contributions to equity investments, primarily Eagle Ford and EagleHawk. We raised about $817 million of equity. The Canada rate case began and a swap on line [ph] largely offset. Coverage was about $2 million positive and then we had $82 million of positive working capital, which was primarily dark [ph] premiums, accrued taxes, AP and AR, offset by some inventory purchases in our Transmix business. So that's KMP.","Moving to EPB, and the first page of EPB is also the GAAP income statement. As Rich said, we're declaring a distribution of $0.55 in the quarter. The GAAP income statement recasts our prior period results to include Cheyenne Plains as if EPB had owned Cheyenne Plains during all periods presented. So when I go to the next page and we go to our calculation of DCF, it will not -- it will only include Cheyenne Plains for the periods that we owned it. So you can see the incremental impact from the acquisition. DCF calculation, this is going to -- for some of you who follow EPB, it's going to be a little bit of a new format. This format is consistent with KMP's format. I think we get to the same answer at the end of the day, it's just done -- it's laid out a little bit differently. So more to KMP, we're just taking that income, adding back DD&A and subtracting sustaining CapEx. There are a couple of other adjustments to get to DCF that you'll see at the bottom. Those are consistent with the adjustments that El Paso was making previously.","So DCF before certain items, as Rich mentioned, at $135 million in the quarter, up $17 million in the quarter, up $22 million year-to-date. $135 million is $0.65 on a per-unit basis versus our $0.55 declared distribution, results in coverage of about $20 million. On the 6 months, the $278 million is $1.35 per unit compared to our declared distribution of $1.06. That's about $60 million. And as Rich mentioned, for the year, we expect to declare distributions of $2.25 and to have coverage in excess of $80 million.","Now just looking at the $17 million, where did that growth come from? If you look out at the segments, the segments were up $17 million, and that's primarily the acquisition of Cheyenne Plains, as well as improved results on Southern Natural as a result of the completed expansion project and greater power demand load. That $17 million, though, because El Paso consolidated the -- all the pipelines in prior periods, it didn't own 100% of those pipelines, and so you're seeing the benefit of the acquisition down below in the minority interest line.","So as EPB has bought more of those assets from El Paso, the minority interest decreases. And so you see that benefit down in the minority interest line below. So if you add that, that takes your $17 million, there's about $4 million of benefit from those incremental acquisitions since 2011. So that's $21 million total increase in the assets.","Sustaining CapEx is a positive $17 million in the quarter. That's because there were -- in 2011, there were some nonrecurring maintenance items. There's some timing, which I will get to in a second, and also the cost savings that we've implemented. So we have $38 million of cash flow available. Interest is up by $10 million as a result of the acquisition. GP incentive is up $13 million as a result of these units issued and the increase in the distribution. There's some other items that are about $2 million, and that takes you to the $17 million.","Same analysis for the year-to-date. The segments are up $7 million. The incremental from acquisitions is -- it shows up in the minority interest line, is about $30 million. That's $37 million total. Sustaining CapEx is $29 million lower. Now on sustaining CapEx, for the full year, what we're expecting is around $55 million to $60 million. So you can see in the quarter and year-to-date, there is some timing relative to the full year. But we do expect -- but we are lower than last year in the quarter.","Interest is up $20 million. GP incentive is up $25 million year-to-date. There is about $1 million of other items, and so that takes you to the increase of $22 million for the year-to-date.","On EPB's balance sheet, the largest change in EPB's balance sheet relates to the drop-down of CIG, the 14% interest in CIG and the Cheyenne Plains. And so you can see that the debt is up about $509 million. And then you also see equity is negative. And those results because we have to recast. And so when we recast this as we own these assets in all periods, when you originally do it, you don't have the financing because they're assuming this happened way in the past. So you put assets on your books. Adding to that, creates a positive in equity. And then when you go finance these assets that are already on your books for GAAP purposes, that is going to be a negative running through your equity account. And so you can see that happening this quarter.","On a debt-to-EBITDA basis, 4.7x versus 4.1x. Now the debt here on the balance sheet has also been recast for Cheyenne Plains. So the 3.990 at the end of the year is not really what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year. So -- what was on the balance sheet at the end of the year was 3.825. So we're up about $800 million year-to-date, and we're up about 700 -- sorry, we're up $800 million from the quarter. We're up about $750 million year-to-date.","The acquisitions, $635 million went out the door on that, but we also issued equity for $64 million. So $570 million net. We assumed $176 million in debt, there is $23 million in expansion capital, $45 million in the termination of an AR program. Cheyenne Plains came with cash of about $20 million. There's about $20 million of coverage and then there's working capital of about $27 million negative, largely associated with accrued interest. Year-to-date, the acquisition, $635 million. $176 million of debt assumed. $40 million of expansion CapEx, same $45 million on the termination of the AR program, same $20 million of cash. Equity issued, $64 million. Coverage is $60 million and then the working capital is about $4 million. And so that is EPB.","Moving to KMI, just couple of overall comments for those of you who might be new. This is our calculation of cash available to pay dividends at KMI. So what we are showing here is the cash that we received based on the declared distribution at KMP and EPB. It is the cash we -- or the cash available for us from our investment in NGPL. And then this quarter, we have added a second section because now KMI owns assets. And so we've tried to divide the schedule: the top schedule, which I'll -- the top half of the schedule, which I'll call the GP section; and the bottom half is what I'll call the asset section. The asset section is assets that we intend to drop over time to KMP and EPB. So it will largely go away over time, and the cash flows will move up into the GP section. Now it's not perfect. There is -- all the interest associated with the El Paso acquisition is in the bottom part of the section. All the cash taxes are in the top part of the section. But if you try to get -- if you ask 5 different people how to allocate this stuff, they do it 5 different ways. So we didn't try to go through an allocation exercise. That's just -- that's so -- just presented it this way for simplicity.","In this schedule, we have full -- there are no transaction costs in the schedule. What we're trying to show here is the recurring cash flow that is available for distribution. So in the quarter, $307 million available for distribution. That's $0.36 a unit -- I mean, per share versus our declared dividend of $0.35 a share. For the 6 months, $610 million, which is $0.79 per share versus $0.67 on a declared basis. The -- we're up, again, $139 million in the quarter, $175 million year-to-date. If you look at what's driving the $139 million, the KMP distribution to us, $393 million, that's up $49 million. The distribution from EPB, $82 million -- up $82 million. And then that's offset somewhat by lower distributions from NGPL, higher interest expense and higher cash taxes, those 3 totaling about $20 million. So the -- you get to about $100 million in cash available to pay dividends before you get to the assets that we own. The assets generated about $38 million. Some of you may say well, that seems kind of low. But remember that all the acquisition interest is allocated to this section. We have already dropped some of the assets to EPB, and the GP and LP contribution from EPB are up above the $80 million.","In the year-to-date, $175 million increase, $767 million is coming from KMP. That's over a $90 million increase. EPB is an $82 million increase. So between the 2 of those, you have about a $170 million increase. NGPL is down a little bit, but NGPL is, for the full year, is consistent with what we budgeted. And so the interest is up a little bit, G&A is up a little bit and cash taxes are up about $20 million to take you to $137 million. Again, we have $38 million from the assets to get you a $175 million increase, which is about 40% increase in the cash available year-to-date.","Moving to the GAAP net income. There's a lot of noise in the -- given all the transaction expenses in the quarter. But our net income attributable to KMI is a $125 million loss. Now in the footnote on the prior page, you can see that there's about $273 million of after-tax expenses associated with EPC transaction and the EPE transaction. There's also a $29 million deferred tax adjustment associated with the transaction. There's $24 million in KMP-certain items that flow through to KMI on an income basis, which is largely KMI's share of the FTC revaluation. And then there's $15 million of other purchase accounting. So if you add those back, which is about $341 million, you get to about $216 million of net income, which is about $0.26 a share. We don't, again, think that the GAAP income statement is overly meaningful, but I know that some of you are required to report net income.","The next page is the GAAP reconciliation, which I'm not going to go through. I'm just going to spend a few minutes on the balance sheet. And the balance sheet is a consolidated balance sheet. It consolidates KMP, EPB into KMI. This is preliminary. We expect that there will be some movement in this balance sheet given the transaction and finalizing purchase accounting. We expect there'll primarily be re-classes, but there could be some other changes as well.","If you look down to the bottom -- oh, first, the change in total assets is about $38.8 billion. Of that, KMP is about $300 million and really, the remaining change is almost all attributable to the acquisition of El Paso. On the debt balance, KMI's debt balance is about $16.4 billion. That debt balance we expect to come down as we drop assets to KMP over -- in this quarter. But some of that debt will move to KMP as KMP takes on debt to finance the acquisition. But on a consolidated basis and pro forma-ing the EBITDA for a full year, we expect to end the year slightly over 5x. The change in debt on the quarter is about -- for the year is about $13.128 billion. For the quarter, it's about $13.155 billion. And so I'm going to reconcile that for you quickly.","The transaction, we assumed about $7.3 billion in net debt from EPC. We also issued about $5.4 billion. And then when KMP purchased the other half of Midstream, it caused us to consolidate Midstream's debt on KMI's balance sheet. So that's another $100 million. So that's about $12.8 billion. So it is up $12.827 billion, and then -- so the change in debt is $328 million after you take out those -- the transaction debt assumed or issued.","The performance metric that we went through was $307 million. There's about $146 million of timing on distributions. That means we recognized those distributions in the quarter for the performance metric, but we haven't received the cash yet. And that's higher than what we would anticipate going forward. What we anticipate going forward is about $15 million. It's higher in this quarter, primarily because this is the first quarter that we've gotten a distribution from EPB. We show it on the performance metric, but we don't actually receive that distribution until August.","We paid $226 million in dividends in the quarter. We repurchased about $110 million of warrants. There's $125 million of transaction-related items, primarily severance and retention bonuses and then the termination of the AR financing facility. And then there is about $28 million of other items, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments to get you to your total change of $328 million. So that's all I have.","Richard D. Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Kim. And with that, we will take any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, starting with KMI here, I'm trying to make sure I understand, Kim, your commentary on the El Paso assets. So you're saying the $142 million of EBITDA is a clean number? In other words, we shouldn't be adding anything back in terms of transaction or any other kind of payments that were related to the acquisition?","Kimberly Allen Dang","That's right. And you can see that detailed in Note 9 on that schedule. We talk about the transaction costs that are excluded from this. And most of those transaction costs are noncash or they're one-time in nature or both.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great.","Kimberly Allen Dang","But the -- adding the -- and so just one other thing. The EBITDA is just 37 days.","Richard D. Kinder","Yes. Just from May 24 through June 30. Okay?","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. Got it. And then can you talk a little bit about your NOL position here post the transaction and how that will play into the cash tax rate you expect to play -- to be paying going forward?","David D. Kinder","There's a fair amount of NOLs that were utilized on the sale of the E&P business, just as we've discussed previously. There are some remaining that are available for drop-downs. We also expect in a number of instances to do a number of dispositions unassociated with the drop-downs. And so we'll manage that as we go forward. There's also some portion of the NOLs that we're not able to use this year and that will roll over into future years.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess is there any estimate you can put on what the cash tax rate would be based on all that?","David D. Kinder","I mean, I think the right way to think about the cash tax rate is to think about it once we get back to a normal steady state where we're primarily a general partner. And then, Kim -- I mean, when we get there, 36%, 37% is around the -- the right recurring cash tax rate to think about.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And then last question is just kind of thinking about capital allocation here at KMI again. Desire to pay down some debt versus increasing the dividend. You had a ratings downgrade yesterday. I guess, some -- would you just talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about the balance sheet?","Richard D. Kinder","Well, of course, first of all, we're going to have the proceeds from the drop-downs to apply to the debt. And again, as quickly as we can, we're going to drop down all these assets into KMP and EPB to get back to being a pure GP. So that's the main source of the debt paydown. And we will intend to distribute -- again, under this formula, we're going to distribute the cash that's generated and available for dividends.","David D. Kinder","I think we have a fairly straightforward path to getting to consolidated debt-to-EBITDA of around 4.5x through the drop-down process. And so I think we'll be working our way to that as we go through these transactions. And again, that's a full 12-month EBITDA to consolidated debt, meaning all of the debt at KMI, EPB and KMP.","Operator","Next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","From a product development -- project development standpoint, if you back out the Trans Mountain expansion and you think about breaking down that remaining, call it, $6 billion of backlog, how do you guys think about allocating capital towards the additional coal export opportunities that seem very promising, relative to possibly importing more gasoline to replace U.S. Northeast refinery closures similar to that expansion you did at Carteret versus, let's just say, enhanced petcoke export abilities?","Richard D. Kinder","Well, I think, first of all, the underlying principal areas, we're not doing any of these unless we have good long-term contracts. And then we just look at it, and we'd be happy to do them all if we have good long-term contracts on it. Just enormous opportunities. Now like I said on the coal export facility, we have 4 right now that have -- are up and running, and 3 of them are being expanded. We have a fifth that we will eventually go to, also on the East Coast, but we're not prepared to do that yet. So I think there are enormous opportunities there, someplace between -- I have said these figures before, they vary a little bit quarter-to-quarter. Someplace between $450 million and $650 million in coal export facilities alone. But we're going to have an expansion at Galena Park pursuant to a new long-term contract that we will be releasing information on tomorrow, as a matter of fact. We're going to have other expansions. Certainly, the Edmonton South terminal, as we say in our release, is actually upscaled again because we had more long-term contracts. I think the BOSTCO facility on the ship channel will also probably be upsized because we think we're about to move beyond 6.6 million barrels that was our original anticipated amount of tankage. We think we'll be able to expand that. So just a lot of opportunities. Again, we'll look at them based on whether they clear our return on capital targets and whether we have good long-term contracts behind them.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Last question, and this is more for Kim. Kim, as it relates to KMR's ability to effectively issue equity and be de facto equity as it's viewed for KMP, how do you think about the market's ability to absorb KMR equity throughout, not just this $2.2 billion capital program, but beyond that?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Well, I guess, we have a couple of tools in our toolbox. I mean, we can issue KMR, or we can issue KMP. And we have the ATM, or we can do stand-alone overnight offerings or marketed offerings on KMR. And so I think on these transactions, KMI will be taking back some equity, which lessens the need. We can do in the range of $300 million a year on the ATM. KMR in and of itself is generating $500 million a year. So you've got $800 million of equity that is sort of -- happens automatically before you even need to go to the market. And so if you think about it that way, that's -- if you say 50-50, that's $1.6 billion capital spend before you even need to access the market on an offering.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of questions on Trans Mountain. Rich, you mentioned that -- something to the effect of recent events, suggested the Canadian government seems intent on streamlining approvals. I don't know if you can expand on that a little bit at all?","Richard D. Kinder","Yes, and those of you who follow it closely, the Premier Harper -- Prime Minister Harper's government has said that they want a full environmental review of these projects, but they want it done on a timely basis. And in fact, there was an article in one of the trade rags this morning saying that the NEB was taking steps in that regard and was looking at an 18-month time horizon for saying yes or no on projects, no matter how complicated they might be. Now I'm always leery when you just set some time frame. But I think, clearly, future projects like Trans Mountain, from the time you file, are not going to be dragged out for 3 or 4 years and have thousands of hours of hearings. I think it -- everyone will have their say at the table, but I think it will be done in a very fair but expedited basis. So we believe it will be done quickly. Now what we have done is, as many of you know, is we have filed with the NEB for approval of the commercial contracts. In other words, what we're doing is converting a pipeline that now moves 300,000 barrels a day and is essentially an open-access pipeline. Now we're expanding it dramatically and we have 500,000-plus barrels that is subscribed under 20-year contracts, clearly leaving plenty of room to handle all of the spot bases. You got 240,000 barrels, 750,000 minus 510,000, to handle all the other business. But we want to get that approved to make sure the NEB agrees with our commercial efforts here, our commercial understandings that we have reached in binding agreements with our customers. In the meantime, we are already going through what's called a consulting project with various interested parties, including NGOs, including the First Nations groups, primarily in British Columbia, and then we will file for the actual permitting of the pipeline itself in late 2013, and that's when the -- when that process will start. And again, if you assume 18 months and that may not be the exact right time, you assume 18 months, you file late in 2013, that would get you approval in the mid-2015 time horizon, give us time to build it in 2015 and 2016. So that's kind of the game plan, nothing -- no rocket science here. But there has been some very positive developments from the standpoint of the Canadian national government saying these are very important assets. It's not just oil sands production, it's some of the mineral production in British Columbia, some of the potash in Saskatchewan, other areas of Canada where they want to make sure that they have an orderly process to consider these. And I think that, that's going to be a positive for our process.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how should we think about project returns for this in terms on returns on invested capital and then the $4.1 billion cost? I know it's early, but how are you potentially protected on that not rising?","Richard D. Kinder","Well, I don't want to go into all the details on returns. I think it's a -- it's an appropriate return and one that's embedded in the contracts, and I think it's a good return for us. It's also very fair to our customers. From the cost side, as we've done in our other projects in Canada, there are cost-sharing mechanisms that -- some of this more locked-in cost will not be subject to escalation or pass-through. Those that can move up or down with events we can't control will be subject to a pass-through arrangement. There'll be a non-control cost. So we think we've got a pretty workable solution there. This is what we did on the last time we expanded Trans Mountain from roughly 220,000 barrels up to 300,000. And it worked very well.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I can leave with a couple of quick ones on just the NGL headwinds, what's the ability of you guys to hedge more on NGLs? And are you currently assuming the deck as is, current NGL prices, stay where they are for the rest of the year? And then final thing, as you mentioned, you have less ethane in your mix. I was wondering if you could just give a rough breakout of sort of the mix, ethane, propane, butane, [indiscernible].","Richard D. Kinder","Yes, I'll let Tim Bradley, who runs CO2, do the latter. But on the former question, we've talked about this before, any hedge that you do on NGLs, in our view, is a pretty dirty hedge. And so we hedge incredible amounts of our production, but we apply it all to the crude oil side, and that means the NGLs is where we have not applied the hedges. And as far as the deck is concerned, yes, we are basically using the forward deck, again because we have more ethane in the mix. Our numbers show we'd be down about 23%, we put that in the press release, from what we had in our budget that we did last November when we just looked at basically the forward curve. And Tim can give you some more flavor on that. Tim?","Richard Tim Bradley","Yes. The NGL mix that you'll commonly find in the Permian basin would be 40% to 50% ethane. We use some of the ethane that we produce in our residue gas. It powers our power plant. So the ethane content in our produced NGL stream is only 18% as it leaves and goes to market. The rest of the mix is pretty much standard in terms of -- the next biggest component is propane, then going down to the isobutanes and pentanes and so forth, natural gasoline. So the ethane is basically being cut in half and being used in our power plant.","Operator","The next question comes from John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a follow-up to Steve's questions. So the dollar amount that you're expecting from the lower NGL prices this year, can you just translate that for us?","Richard D. Kinder","Yes. I think Kim said that. We think that's a downturn of about $60 million resulting from that, if what we project now continues for the rest of the year.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as far as the trajectory or the pace of drop-downs and financing of such, if you could just give a little more flavor on that.","Richard D. Kinder","Yes. I'll say a couple of things. First of all, as we've said, we expect to drop -- to make the drop of 100% of Tennessee and 50% of EPNG in the third quarter, this quarter. We also expect to complete the sale of the FTC mandated sale in this quarter. With regard to future drop downs, we're going to do them as quickly as we can to both MLPs. We originally said it would probably take us to sometime in '15 to get all this done. I'm modestly hopeful we can get it done substantially in advance of that. I'm looking forward to the day when Kim will be able to give you a much simpler summary of how we get to cash available for dividends at KMI, and it will be simply all the GP and units. We will be back to being a pure GP. Now part of the reason for that is that the sale that was mandated by the FTC is somewhat larger than we thought it would be and, therefore, KMP can move more quickly. It has more proceeds coming in than we anticipated. It can move more quickly to take on more assets. But we think we can move this pretty quickly, and we're anxious to get back to a pure GP, where you can evaluate it just on that basis.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So broadly speaking, maybe -- and thinking about it, maybe end of '14 is -- might be a reasonable assumption for our modeling purposes?","Richard D. Kinder","No, that's probably as good as any. I would hope we might even beat that a little bit.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as far as -- what's the expectation now for financing, kind of what you've been doing before, sort of 50-50? And then how much paper do you think KMI might take back in the process?","Richard D. Kinder","Now a part -- David, you want to...","David D. Kinder","Yes. I mean, in KMI, we'll take some back as Kim noted. And I think the ultimate financing will be consistent with what we've done in the past, with the objective of maintaining a very solid balance sheet at KMP.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Tysseland with Citigroup.","John K. Tysseland - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Rich, I guess do you envision being able to leverage TGP's asset position to expand really your further investments in the Midstream, kind of like what you did in the Eagle Ford but up in the Marcellus? And I guess what kind of timing do you think about if that is the case?","Richard D. Kinder","Yes. We definitely plan on doing that. And so far -- again, remember, we're just 2 months into this thing. So far, I've been very encouraged with the opportunities we have. We're going to move on them just as quickly as we can get the long-term contracts solidified, and I would hope we'd be in a position to make some announcements in the third quarter of some projects. And I think there will be others after that. Tennessee is a fantastically positioned pipeline. And the other thing that -- across all of the El Paso assets, we kind of sweep away storage. But the combined entity, all the Kinder Morgan companies, now have about 680 Bcf of gas storage capacity, and we think there are enormous opportunities there to use that more efficiently, to create more injection and withdrawal capacity, serve our customers better, and we've got a full court press on that. And I don't know if you want to call that midstream exactly, but certainly it gives us a lot of additional opportunities. So they are just -- when you add all this up, power demand, storage opportunities, opportunities to expand the midstream off of this big footprint of pipelines we have, we're just really encouraged about the long-term opportunities. And when we talk about approaching $10 billion in potential projects now, I think those will go very nicely as we get deeper and deeper into this, and that will be over a period of several years, I think. So yes, I think just lots of opportunities to leverage Tennessee, additional opportunities out West and additional opportunities in the Southeast.","John K. Tysseland - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's great color. One more thing. When you look at TGP and EPNG, I believe both of those are already in LLC's and don't need to be, I guess, converted into C corps before they're dropped down into KMP, but I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, how many other assets are currently in sub-C corps that are up at the KMI today?","Richard D. Kinder","David?","David D. Kinder","Yes. Tennessee is already in a LLC. EPNG will be converted into an LLC at the time of the drop-down. I think if you look at some of the other assets up there, John, you have the Midstream operation, which is already in an LLC that KMP owns 50% of. Citrus FTC is in C corp and will remain in C corp in that regard. Ruby is in a flow-through entity and then Gulf LNG is in a flow-through entity. So I think you're right, predominantly. The biggest asset that's not is FGT\/Citrus but outside of that, should be enough flow-through-type vehicles.","John K. Tysseland - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then lastly, on EPNG, you have a big chunk of contract rollovers in 2012. How do you think about those contracts renewals as you move on throughout the year and also year-to-date? And then given -- looking at the basis differential -- I mean, the basis differential remains pretty attractive so it seems like you would get pretty good support for that. But I was trying to figure out how you think about that on a cash flow forward basis.","Richard D. Kinder","Yes, well, you're right. The basis differential has been pretty good. And I think on a going-forward basis, we've got a model we're working on that we had when we put the acquisition plan together. And so far, we're tracking pretty close to that model. So I think we'll do that well or better. The real opportunity of course on EPNG, I believe, is east of California. There is a tremendous demand for increased exports to Mexico. We have publicly surfaced already about 3 of those projects, and we think that -- not only does that have the benefit of allowing us to earn money on incremental investments as we build, if you will, drops or laterals down to the border off of the EPNG mainline, but it also obviously puts more volume through the EPNG mainline. And I think we -- that will be a big source of opportunity for us. I think, also, you will have some east of California coal-fired generation that we'll be converting to natural gas as time goes on, and I believe there may be some potential for alternative uses. Some of the EPNG lines, there's a lot of duplication there. So we're just getting into it, but we've got a very bright guy running that for us, and I think we will find some real opportunities to benefit there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Curt Launer with Deutsche Bank.","Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Wanted to just follow up with some of the questions that have asked before in maybe a couple of different ways. First, relative to the specificity you've given us of an expectation of 50% of EPNG to be dropped down, you could go through what your expectations might be relative to the financing model of that and how much debt remains to be assumed by KMP in that drop-down. And also, I guess I'll admit to try and ask the NOL question that started this session in a different way. Have you reported or do you expect to report maybe this year end the tax basis from the old E&P assets, such that we can figure out the outlook for taxes on gains on future drop-downs?","David D. Kinder","Yes. I mean, the amount of debt assumed in the drop-down [indiscernible]?","Unknown Executive","Yes. On Tennessee, Tennessee basically has about $1.8 billion of debt, and El Paso Natural Gas is about $1.15 billion on an 8\/8 basis down at El Paso Natural Gas.","David D. Kinder","Yes. And then on the NOLs, my expectation is that there will be disclosure in the 10-K, just like there was this year.","Operator","The next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So just looking for a little clarity, if you can provide it, on your latest thoughts on the EP Corp. debt. And how should we be thinking about drop-down proceeds flowing across KMI debt versus the legacy EP Corp. bonds?","David D. Kinder","I mean, I think the right way to think about that is that we will end up guaranteeing the EP Corp. debt, and so what we will do with proceeds is pay down debt in the most efficient manner possible. But it shouldn't make much difference to bondholders.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So it's really just going to be driven by the cost of paying down debt, and we shouldn't think of any particular strategy between the 2?","David D. Kinder","Right. The strategy is going to be minimizing the cost.","Operator","We do show one last question from John Edwards from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, just a follow-up. In the past, you've been guiding at KMI, I think at 12.5% dividend growth. And KMP, I believe it was around 8% distribution growth per unit going forward. Any change to the long-term guidance at this point?","Richard D. Kinder","Yes, the guidance has been, since the time we did the merger and announced the merger last fall, has been 12.5% growth at KMI. That's off the '11 base through 2015 and 7% compound growth at KMP. And that's also off of the 2011 base, so through 2015. So yes, we feel good about those, 7% at KMP, 12.5% at KMI and about 9% at EPB, and those all continue to look good. And I think, just -- I think you can tell from this call that we're pretty enthusiastic about the El Paso assets. Sometimes, we've done a lot of these acquisitions, sometimes you get in there and you turn over the rocks and there's nothing but big snakes under it. But in this time, we've turned over the rocks and actually, we haven't found very many snakes, if at all. So we're very positive on -- nothing that we have encountered so far has led us to assume any kind of negatives versus our original acquisition plan on the El Paso assets.","David D. Kinder","Yes, Rich. The other thing I'm going to add is going to go back to a couple of the questions that have been asked. We're not dodging the questions on the NOLs. You should just recognize, on the NOLs, this is a function of the tax return. The actual calculations won't be finalized until we do our tax return next year. And so we don't want to be giving you numbers that may ultimately move, and it's complicated enough that it's difficult to come up with the estimates. And so that's why we're not being forthcoming with numbers right now. Those are difficult calculations.","Operator","I am showing no questions, sir.","Richard D.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, May and welcome to the Kinder Morgan third quarter investor call. As usual before we begin I would like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and this call includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","Before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang let me make a couple of brief comments one more industry wide in nature and the other specific to KMI. Let\u2019s start with the industry wise thought. We continue to be bullish on the prospects for North American Energy especially natural gas. And as the largest midstream management company in North America, we believe we are well positioned in our existing businesses and with our backlog growth projects.","Fossil fuels, and especially natural gas which has now surpassed coal as the primary fuel source for prior generation in the U.S. are going to be needed for a long long time. I would add that natural gas is a key in reducing CO2 emissions in America. For example, despite a substantial increase in electric generation over the levels of 1993 the CO2 emissions from electric generation in 2015 were flat for those in 1993 largely as a result of the increased use of natural gas to generate that electricity. So natural gas is playing a major role in reducing emissions. But there have been recent controversies as you all know surrounding new pipeline projects and I would like to offer my perspective.","First, to the extent it becomes difficult to build new infrastructure that tends to make existing pipeline networks more valuable and we obviously have a tremendous existing network. Second, while the protestors tend to get the headlines, it is still possible to build out new infrastructure. This quarter for example, we completed an expansion on our Texas Gas pipeline network. Third, and maybe most importantly I think is to distinguish the permitting environment, both geographically and jurisdictionally.","There is a big difference for example between state permitted projects where eminent domain is a function of state law and the federally certificated natural gas project. Ultimately we realize that the environment is changing and we are adapting by building those changing circumstances into how we budget and plan our projects.","Now to the comment specific to Kinder Morgan. During the third quarter, we substantially reduced our debt and this positions us for long term value creation. We are now ahead of our plan for 2016 year end leverage and as the Chairman and largest shareholder of the company I am very pleased with the progress we are making towards achieving our target leverage level of around five times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This will put us in a position to deliver substantial value to our shareholders through dividend increases, share repurchases, attractive growth projects or further debt reduction.","Now because we get so many questions regarding these alternatives, let me expand a bit on this subject. Our current view leans towards increasing the dividend substantially while maintaining both greater coverage than in the past and a stronger balance sheet. That said, we\u2019ll obviously make the best economic decision at the time we reach that point and we can\u2019t give you exact timing on when we will reach our target because there are numerous factors involved.","But as I said, the message today is we are pleased with the progress to date. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Good day, thanks Rich. So I\u2019ll update on capital projects and counterparty credit and then hit on some segment highlights and trends. On the capital update, two of our larger projects first on Trans Mountain, on that expansion we\u2019ll start with the fundamentals.","We consistently hear from producers in Canada and some refiners in the Northwest U.S. that they are counting on this project to get build. Production is expected to continue growing even though it\u2019s at a slower rate on the oil sands and take away capacity projects continue to lag the demand.","Oil prices have hurt the oil sands no question, but from the perspective of our expansion the supply and demand fundamentals for new takeaway capacity are good. We are nearing the end of the federal review process right now. We have our NEB recommendation finding the project to be in the public interest and the federal government has undertaken its further consultation process with the objective of a final decision in December of this year. We\u2019ve made great progress with communities along the route, and have agreements with the majority of the most directly affected First Nations bands.","We are actively engaged with the BC government on the satisfaction of their five conditions. Finally I\u2019ll note that we do believe that this project would make a very good candidate for brining in other investors through a joint venture or other structure. It is an attractive project economically and there is substantial interest in it. We believe that the project needs to ripen through the view processes that are nearing a conclusion now they following those reviews assuming the outcomes are favorable or if the outcomes are favorable we would look to syndicate this investment. We\u2019ve got a lot of options here including self funding so we are not committing to any one approach but we do think it\u2019s worth exploring the options at the right time.","On Elba we have our 7C certificate from FERC, we got that in June but the news is that we have received now our first significant notices to proceed from FERC just this week and as the authorization follows the 7C that takes our implementation plan, it gives us permission to go forward with this structure.","So we and Shell our customers are prepared for us to begin construction starting the first of November. With respect to the rest of our projects, we have been docking for several quarters now about high grading the backlog that\u2019s making sure that we are attending to our balance sheet and also ensuring that we grow value through investments at attractive returns that we can fund out of the cash flow that we generate that is without needing to access the capital markets.","This quarter our backlog stands at $13 billion that\u2019s down from $13.5 billion last quarter. We believe it\u2019s an attractive slate of projects projected 6.5 times CapEx to EBITDA multiple, 87% of the backlog is for fee-based projects in our pipelines and terminals businesses. The changes from that 13.5 to the 13, we put $600 million worth of projects into service during the quarter including bringing on intrastate Texas gas crossover project that\u2019s in support of LNG and Mexico market. Taking delivery of two Jones Act vessels which are under charter, completing two smaller liquids terminal expansions and we completed the phase 1 of our Tall Cotton enhanced oil recovery project.","So $600 million went into service. We added a little over $200 million of projects in the quarter. A $130 million of that in gas and $75 million in CO2 where we continue to see good returns even in current prices. If you look at the year-to-date numbers we\u2019ve added a little under $600 million dollars about $575 million in new projects, now that\u2019s been - the backlog has been coming down, so that\u2019s been more than -- those editions have been more than offset by projects that\u2019s going into service and project cancellations earlier in the year.","But overall I think what this shows you is we\u2019ve been successful in doing what we set out to do. We have high graded the backlog to strengthen our balance sheet and enable the funding of our growth projects without needing to access capital markets while continuing to add projects where we find them at attractive returns.","Now turning to customer credit. We have a broad diverse customer base with overall very good credit quality. We continue our extreme focus throughout our commercial and corporate organizations, active monitoring calling for collateral etcetera and we\u2019ve seen some stabilization in counter party credit as our producer customers have been actively addressing their issues over the last few quarters.","So in the past quarter, we were not impacted by any customer defaults. We had one customer file for bankruptcy and the reorganized entity continued to now track with us, so no impact from customer defaults in the third quarter.","So now turning to the segment for some highlight and trends there, starting with the GAAP measures. GAAP segment earnings were down $211 million for the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to higher impairments in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year, those were primarily comprised of $350 million dollar non-cash impairment on our MEP investment driven by the expectation of future lower contract rates and approximately $84 million loss associated with partial sale of S&G.","If you look at segment earnings before DD&A and certain items which is how we measure our performance we are down $33 million or 2% quarter-to-quarter. CO2 is down $53 million year-over-year due to lower prices $62 barrel realized versus $74 in the third quarter of last year and lower production. Nevertheless we expect CO2 to make plan due to some price improvement versus our plan price and good performance on cost savings for that segment.","Compared to the same quarter last year, gas is down 2%, while terminals and products up 22% and 7% respectively, overall we think again that the quarter\u2019s performance demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows even in difficult commodity price environments.","Focusing on some of the broad trends affecting our business first in natural gas, we\u2019re seeing the demand side developments that we anticipated. On our systems specifically we are benefitting from increased demand for gas in the power sector, increased exports to Mexico and now for the first time increases due to LNG exports.","On Kinder Morgan pipelines, power driven gas demand was up 9% 3Q to 3Q from 6.5 Bcf last year to 7 Bcf this quarter. On a macro basis, [gases] now we are taking coal as Rich mentioned as a fuel source for power generation.","Mexico export demand on our pipelines grew by 6% year-over-year for the quarter and is up 15% on the comparable year-to-date number. We reached an average volume of 2.8 Bcf a day for the quarter about 75% of total exports to Mexico.","We are in the early days of LNG export driven demand but even with the Sabine pass outage in the last two weeks of the quarter, we experienced about 350 a day of LNG demand on our systems and much more to come there [Indiscernible].","Most of our $4 billion of backlog projects in the gas sector are directed at those three market trends plus one more and that is the reversal projects on our TGP systems to more of Marcellus and Utica gas to the south.","Natural gas which is by far our largest sector is kind of an [80:20 story] with approximately 80% of the budget segment earnings before DD&A attributable to transportation and storage which benefits from the trends I just discussed and the other 20% in gathering and processing.","Our gathered volumes are down 17% to 18% year-over-year as a result of declines in the Eagle Ford, Oklahoma, and the Bakken. Our Bakken Midstream financial performance is up year-over-year and up versus plan primarily due to contract restructuring earlier in the year and overall this business outside of the take or pay commitments that we have is dependent on the recovery in those phases as gas demand grows and oil prices and therefore drilling recovers.","We continue to believe that the need for natural gas transportation storage capacity will grow as demand trends that I talked about continue and in the longer term the gathering volume flatten and turn up when we ultimately see recovery in the gas supply basis that we serve.","In products pipelines we are getting the benefit year-over-year of higher volumes. Refined products volumes are up 3% quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year and well above the growth in the EIA national numbers. Our crude and condensate volumes are up 6% year-over-year, our NGL volumes are down 1% primarily due to a petrochemical plant turn around by one of our customers.","In terminals we are seeing the benefit of new liquids capacity coming online and increased utilization of that expanded capacity, so more capacity on line and higher overall utilization. We also took delivery of two additional Jones Act vessels which are under contract. Overall the liquids portion of our terminals business is over 75% of the segment earnings before DD&A, before certain items and the increased utilization we are seeing and the expansions we are bringing on are positives for that long term outlook.","With respect to the Jones Act vessels, we see medium term market weakness there. We benefit from having charters in place with a vast majority of our vessels. And we have a modern fuel efficient fleet that should be very competitive but we expect some over capacity in the market for the medium term which will affect new charter rates and renewal rates till the overall U.S. fleet is right sized from the capacity standpoint.","At the bulk side we are down slightly year-over-year primarily again attributable to the coal business. In CO2 we have lower volumes year-over-year for the quarter, down 5% with SACROC and Yates down year-over-year. Katz, Goldsmith, and Tall Cotton up year-over-year but below our plan. We also had strong NGL production of the segment a record quarter impact which is slightly higher than last year. And we also approved some new EOR development projects during the quarter and continue to find attractive return projects in this segment.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim for the financials.","Kim Dang","Okay, thanks, Steve. Today we are declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave here in December of last year. First, turning to the preliminary GAAP income statement, you will see that similar to the first two quarters of this year revenues in the quarter are down significantly as I say many quarters we believe that revenue or the changes in revenues are not necessarily a good indicator of our performance.","We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not which is why you also see a partially offsetting variance in cost of sales. In addition, both revenues and cost of sales can be impacted by non-cash and sporadic accounting entries for certain items, the largest impact of the certain items on changes and revenues and cost of sales relates to the unrealized CO2 mark-to-market and hedge and effectiveness impact on our change in revenues which accounts for almost 40% of the $377 million change in revenues in the quarter.","We had a net loss in the quarter of $227 million and a loss per share of $0.10 versus income of $186 million and earnings per share of $0.08 in the third quarter of last year, a reduction of $413 million and $0.18 a share.","Now, let me talk about what\u2019s driving that loss. We recorded a $230 million non-cash after tax and that\u2019s why that number is a little different from what Steve said, because this is after tax impairment on our MEP investment driven by expectations of lower future transportation contract rates and approximately a $350 million after tax loss associated with the SNG transaction most of which is non-cash book tax expense.","For those of you who are interested and how we can have such a large book tax expense on a relatively modest book loss when you had ordinarily expect a book tax benefit, I would be happy to explain later that I\u2019m not going to bore everybody with all the details at this point.","Together these two charges result in a net expense of $580 million and are the primary drivers of our $570 million and certain items for the quarter, so net income before certain items was a positive $343 million. The adjusted number in 2015 of was $345 million or down $2 million essentially flat. EPS excluding certain items was $0.15 or down $0.01 versus the third quarter of 2015. So essentially flat when excluding certain items.","Now let\u2019s turn to the second page of the financials, which shows our DCF for the quarter and year-to-date, and is reconciled to our GAAP numbers and the earnings release. DCF is the primary financial measure on which management judges its performance. We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.05 billion versus $1.095 billion for the comparable period in 2015, down $48 million or 4%.","There are a lot of moving parts, but if you want a very simple explanation it boils down to CO2 being down $53 million primarily on lower commodity prices. But to take you through a more granular analysis, the segments were down by $33 million or 2%. And as our previously mentioned CO2 decreased $53 million and natural gas decreased about $18 million which offset those two segments were offset by increases in all of our other segments, with the largest dollar increase from the other segments coming from our terminal segments.","The natural gas segment would have been slightly positive if you exclude the impact of the SNG sale which we sold a 50% interest in -- on September 1st of this year. Adding back an $11 million change in JV DD&A, which primary reflects our increased interest in GPL that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we add that back to the segments, the segments down $33 million. The assets are really down about $22 million.","This $22 million decrease was partially offset by $12 million benefit i.e. lower expense when you combine G&A and interest expense. $19 million in increased cash taxes which is primarily driven by the fact that Citrus fully utilizes NOLs in 2015 is largely offset by an $18 million decrease in sustaining CapEx a lot of which is cost savings.","Netting up the $39million increase in preferred stock dividends gets to a DCF variance of $50 million versus the $48 million shown on the page. DCF per share was $0.48 in the quarter versus $0.51 for the third quarter of last year or down $0.03 per share with about $0.02 associated with the DCF variance I just walked you through and about $0.01 due to the additional shares that were issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects to maintain our balance sheet.","$0.48 in DCF per share results in $801 million in excess distributable cash flow above our $0.125 dividend for the quarter. And year-to-date we have generated approximately $2.5 billion of excess distributable cash flow above our dividend.","Now let me give you some details on our expected performance for the full year versus budget. Natural gas pipelines is expected to be approximately 5% below its budget due to the SNG transaction, lower volumes in our midstream group, and a delay on our EEC SNG pipeline expansion and service as a result of a delay in receiving our FERC certificate.","If you exclude the impact of a sale of the 50% interest in SNG we would have expected natural gas to be about 2% below its budget. So on an apples-to-apples basis, the 2% is consistent with what we told you last quarter for the natural gas pipeline segment.","CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Some price help and cost savings are offsetting the lower than expected oil and CO2 volumes. We currently expect terminals to end the year about 5% below its budget, that\u2019s a slightly more than the 4% we discussed last quarter. The overall variance is due to the impact of the coal bankruptcies and lower throughput and ancillaries on some of our liquids terminals versus what we budgeted.","Actually throughput on our liquids terminals year-to-year when you compare it to 2015 is actually it\u2019s just slightly lower than what we expected in our budget. We currently expect products to end the year approximately 5% below its budget consistent with the guidance we gave you last quarter, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle, lower throughput on KMST, and lower rates on our SFP pipeline and as a result of the loss income due to the sale of Parkway.","Consistent with last quarter, we are projecting KMC to be essentially on its budget. With respect to other items interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining on a combined basis for those items we are expecting to come in lower than budget or said in other way they are expected to be a favorable variance, primarily as a result of lower interest in sustaining CapEx.","Interest is expected to be approximately 4% below its budget; about half of this variance or over half of this variance is associated with the lower balance as a result of the SNG transaction with the remaining variance driven primarily by lower rates. Sustaining CapEx is also expected to be approximately 4% lower than budget.","Let me conclude with two overall financial points. On an apples-to-apples basis, our full year guidance has not changed from the updated guidance we gave you last quarter when you excluded the impact from the 50% sale of SNG.","We continue to expect that adjusted EBTIDA will be about 3% below budget and DCF will be approximately 4% below budget. When you adjust for the four month impact of the 50% SNG sale, though not on an apples-to-apples basis with what we gave you last quarter, we expect EBITDA to be approximately 4% below budget, but DCF will also be approximately 4% below budget.","DCF doesn\u2019t change versus SNG transaction, versus no SNG transaction given the interest rate savings and 4% doesn't change given the interest rate savings offset from the impact to the lost SNG EBITDA as we use all the proceeds from this transaction to reduce debt.","And the second point is that we expect in the year a 5.3 times debt to EBITDA which is also consistent with what we told you in the second quarter call. The 5.3 is down from our budget guidance of 5.5 times largely as a result of the SNG transaction.","With that, I'll move to the balance sheet. When you look at total assets on the balance sheet, total assets are down $2.5 billion and that's largely driven by the sale of the 50% interest in SNG.","We ended the quarter with net debt of $39.25 billion which is down $1.976 from the end of last year and down $2.073 billion from the second quarter. We ended the quarter at 5.3 times debt to EBITDA and as I said that's where we would expect to in the year. And the 5.3 times is down from the 5.6 times where we ended last year.","Now to reconcile the change in debt for you for the quarter as I said, debt is down $2.073 billion, we've generated DCF of $1.08 billion. We spend about $550 million in expansion CapEx acquisitions and contributions to equity investments.","We paid $280 million in dividends. We have proceeds from divestitures of about $1.43 billion with the biggest being the SNG transaction. We also deconsolidated about $1.2 billion in debt as a result of the SNG transaction.","And we also took $8.3 million of the cash that we received from that transaction and it is sitting in restricted cash, so in other current assets on our balance sheet. And we use that to pay debt on October 1st, so that debt was not [paid down as of 9\/30], but has subsequently been paid down.","And then we had $9 million of working capital and other items that was a use of cash. Year to-date the change in debt $1.976 billion, so we've reduced debt by just under $2 billion. We've generated DCF of $3.36 billion. We had expansions, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments of $2.43 billion.","We paid dividends of $839 million. We had proceeds from divestitures of $1.65 billion. We deconsolidated $1.2 billion of SNG debt. We placed $800 million again into Escrow which is shown on restricted cash or other current assets on our balance sheet.","Again the paid down, we use to pay down debt on October the 1st, and then we had working capital and other items that was use of cash of about $168 million. And that gets you to the $1.976 billion reduction in debt.","So with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Kim. And with that May, we will open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer portion. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kristina Kazarian from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Kristina Kazarian","Afternoon, guys. Steve appreciated the projects updates. A couple of quick clarifications; on Utopia any color on the judges denial of your use of eminent domain and maybe could you talk about what this means for that projects? And then on Elba, appreciate the November 1st date, but can you just remind me. Am I still going through that hearing process and what does that mean for that project going forward?","Steve Kean","Okay. I'll start with Utopia. We had Wood County judge who interpreting the eminent domain statute, interpreted that our pipeline didn't qualify for eminent domain. We're feeling that in fact we file the appeal last week, it\u2019s been consistent with other decisions including appellate decisions that have been made in the state, so we think we'll ultimately going to prevail on appeal there.","There maybe some other decisions that come out of Wood County they will be consistent with that, but we expect to ultimately to prevail on appeal. Now we are going to - we are in the process of evaluating what that means. We're two-thirds of the way through acquiring right way already separate apart from what happened with that decision. So, now this is fairly recent news and so we're sitting down and strategizing about how to go forward with the acquisition of the remaining right-of-way what are legal strategy is going to be et cetera, but that what that decision about, that's where we are in the project in terms of acquiring right-of-way what we plan to do in term of what we've already done in term of appeal.","On the Elba projects, yes, we have - we've reach agreement with Shell to proceed without the rehearing having been finalized. So, we're ready to go. Our customers ready to go, we're ready to go, we have our 7C already as I mentioned. We have the notice to proceed which gives us the authority to go forward with construction even without a final order of the hearing. So we are proceeding and starting up November 1.","Kristina Kazarian","Perfect. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up from me too, Rich mentioned the change in regulatory headwinds. Do you think there is a possibility for a change intact to the positive here, what could be a driver for that? And if we don't make a change what could be some other ways you adjust when thinking about new projects going forward?","Kim Dang","I'll start with the latter part first, and Rich mentioned this on the adjustments. What we need to do is and we been doing for months now is evaluating our project opportunities and having discussions with our customers that attempt to price and schedule into our projects, what is no doubt an enhanced regulatory burden for getting those projects through the permitting and approval process. So we have to make the appropriate adjustments.","In terms of what can turn that around. Again, this varies from place to place. I mean we built our Texas pipeline over the summer effectively and you have to go kind of place by place and kind of commodity by commodity to just sort this out, but the bottom is if you need to fully take into account, we need to fully take into account the additional length and requirements that will be placed on the permitting process.","So, it\u2019s not that the whole world need to change, this is a kind of a case by case consideration that you need to make. The other thing that can change the whole dynamic is I think increasingly people will realize those who can already, it\u2019s been a big part of the answer to reduce CO2 emissions and cleaner power generation and compliance with the clean power plant and things like that is enhanced, is additional natural gas and you don't get the additional natural gas without the additional gas infrastructure. So I think that's a driver that could potentially change some of that dynamic.","Kristina Kazarian","Sounds great. And Kim thanks for the walk as well.","Kim Dang","Welcome.","Operator","Next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Steve Kean","Hi, Jeremy.","Operator","Kindly check you mute function Mr. Tonet. We'll move to next question and that is from Ms. Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Christine Cho","Hi, everyone. I wanted to touch upon Elba. Regarding the rehearing how should we think about expectations for this asset to be put into a JV, do you want the final FERC order or even talks with parties and just waiting for that. Or have talks sort of curb now just because it's not as urgent with, but which coming in better than your target for year end?","Steve Kean","Yes. Christine, we've talked and we put Elba in as a placeholder kind of where we showed everyone our capital expenditure plans and everything at the beginning of the year. Placeholder as JV we don't have the JV Elba. I think it is a very amendable to a joint venture. It is a standalone asset investment at least when it comes to liquefaction facilities and it's attractive. It's under a 20 years contract for Shell. We've got the ability to sell fund that or JV it, but it is an attractive JV candidate, but again we're not in a position where we have to do anything and particular with it.","But we continue to explore option to JV assets and that's one of the big variables and sort of what our plans are and how quickly we get to where we want to go and Elba is certainly on the list of things that we can consider. I don't think the rehearing really bears on it that much one way or the other. I mean I think in the context of FERC 7C it is often, it's traditional for you get the 7C and you start construction when you get the notice to proceed without waiting for the rehearing.","In this case I would say, we've got an extremely tight, extremely well reason, extremely thorough 7C. They took extra time to get it out and so we think it's going to withstand any rehearing or appeal and so we're going to go ahead and get started.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. That was helpful. And then moving over to Trans Mountain I know we've got a couple of months before we hear from the Canadian government on this project. And I know earlier in the remarks you said you're open to JVs, but how do you guys think about project financing this project? Or what terms that usually come with project financing immediately rule that out, and by terms I mean anything that would restrict how cash you could pay out from the asset. Just curious as to how you think about that option?","Kim Dang","Well, I think we'll figure out what the structure is going to be first in terms of is it going to be a JV candidate, is it not going be the JV candidate and what's the timing of it going forward and then we'll figure out what the exact financing plan would be. But I wouldn't anticipate that we would put in structures that would make it difficult for us to get the cash out of the asset.","Christine Cho","And would you say you would being towards having the assets kind of the off balance sheet or that's kind of [Indiscernible]?","Kim Dang","If you're asking -- I think that the way -- we would look at it both ways. Having the leverage on our balance sheet and not having on our balance sheet just to make sure that we are in an okay place even if the leverage was on our balance sheet.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. And then last one from me. Over the third quarter we saw a big M&A announcement between two of your peers and then talks of another buyer trying to pick the interest of another company. I'm just curious as to what your view on the landscape is for M&A in the U.S and in Canada? And do you think we're finally going to see corporate M&A deals get done with everyone trying to fill in the holes of their portfolio and it also being increasingly more difficult to build new infrastructure like you said earlier Rich, or do you think it\u2019s just more fact specific?","Steve Kean","I think it\u2019s always pretty fact specific or situation specific. We continue to look for the opportunities, but in addition to being accretive to DCF they kind of need to be accretive to leverage metrics, they still have to work for that standpoint. So, it\u2019s a little more difficult to get through the screens, but I think ultimately there's going to be consolidation in this sector. If you look at the numbers and you look at how many players are out there and we would expect ultimately to be a participant in that.","Christine Cho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Mr. Brian Gamble from Simmons & Company. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon, Brian.","Brian Gamble","Good afternoon Rich. How you're doing?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Brian Gamble","Kind of maybe just follow-up on the M&A discussion while we've got it, I think is a tough one to get through, lots of moving pieces with any combination that may try to put together, but when you think about individual assets. And Steve you mentioned essentially the deleveraging events, given the assets that you guys have in place today. Are there assets that if they were deleveraging events in totality you would consider divesting them, and of course I'm speaking specifically about CO2, but it\u2019s getting something north of the deleverage multiple enough to make an asset that didn't quite score to your competencies, sellable items?","Steve Kean","There are unique considerations that surround everyone. As we've shown making progress this year on our leverage metrics, we've considered non-core asset sales. We had a few of those and the big transaction of course with SNG and that was the bit unique circumstances, we're not generally in the business of selling cash flow in pipeline asset. But in that particular case we had partner who is bring value, securing the assets, but also bringing incremental investment opportunities to project, so made a lot of sense for us to ahead and do that.","With respect to CO2 specifically we like that business. It\u2019s a good business. We invest and get good returns on that business. It\u2019s a niche for us. We're not out chasing E&P and Shell and offshore and things like that. We have CO2 which is a scares commodity and we have the infrastructure to get it delivered to EOR fields where it\u2019s the only thing that can free up oil. And we've integrated forward into enhance all recovery and we've got expertise there. We think we're good at it. So we like that business and we're happy to keep running it.","If you think about new question in terms of transaction or potential transaction, we are shareholder directed company and if there is a transaction to be done that will improve overall value for our shareholders, we are absolutely going to considered and do it if it make sense. The considerations around CO2 specifically is that it would probably slightly dilutive or somewhat dilutive. And then the question would have to be is the multiple expansion that you get on the remaining EBITDA of the remaining business and yield contraction on DCF that you get by having a better portfolio or a more stable portfolio of remaining businesses enough to offset that introduce real shareholder value.","And certainly there are theoretical numbers at which that would work. And so again we're shareholder directed company. We're going to do the things that are going to make sense and create value for our shareholders.","Brian Gamble","On the shareholder comment do you think there's enough shareholder support of the sale of that assets that make it a more, I guess, make the hurdle easier to jump over knowing that shareholder support that type of decision?","Steve Kean","I think it's about the numbers for us, and it\u2019s about what's going to make economic sense. As I said, what would the dilution be and what would our multiple increase need to be more than offset that, so at the other side of it a shareholder is better off. That's the calculation we make.","Brian Gamble","Great. And then last question from me. Rich you mentioned for the opening remarks I think first priority for increased cash flow would be after of course you get to your debt metric. I think you put a significant increase in the dividend over time. Clarify one thing for me, are we getting the five times before contemplating that or we having visibility to get the five times before that is contemplation?","Rich Kinder","I think we've always said, we wanted to get to around five times before we increase the dividend and that's still our target. But again I think it's important that we've got so many questions about this. We elected to layout a little bit detail on and our game plan again we would reserve the right to see what the facts on the ground or when we get to that point, but our game plan would be we obviously have a lot of fire power, lot of free cash flow and to the extent we can substantially increase the dividend while still [maintaining an average] coverage ratio and by that I would mean that we would be able to fund the equity portion of our going rate of capital expenditures, we don't know exactly what that is, but we look back and you take out the things going through book constrictor like Trans Mountain for example.","You are kind of in that, I don't know, two, two and a half, 3 billion in that range and if you say once our balance sheet is where we want and we're going to finance half of that out of retaining cash and half of that back in the debt market at that point in time than you can get, you can see your way clear to having a very nice dividend but with very nice coverage and maintaining a strong balance and that's really the prime factor that we're looking for and I think, I mean, just look at this year and I think Kim emphasize this year, we're right consistent ebbs on the SNG transaction where we told you in April and where we told you in July was going to be and at least the DCF of about $2 per share for this year and we're paying out $0.50 dividend and that's well spread between the two.","But at some point when we get this balance sheet the way we want it, we're going to be able to take that dividend up substantially and still have adequate coverage. We're not going back to having $0.05 of coverage or something like that, because we like to cover our portion, the equity portion of the normalized CapEx program.","Brian Gamble","Appreciate the color, Rich.","Operator","Our next is from Brandon Blossman from Tudor, Pickering. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hello, Brandon.","Brandon Blossman","Good afternoon everyone. I guess let's start with Trans Mountain again. Steve you are pretty clear or I would say, very clear on your messaging around JV potential for Trans Mountain. I guess one question is, has anything changed quarter over quarter that cause you to be clearer about that messaging, was it counterparty interest or has this been kind of the plan all along?","Steve Kean","Well, I think it\u2019s - we talked about it and answer to a question I think on the last call, so it\u2019s consistent within to that point, but we're getting closer now to some - to decision point and resolution and yes, there's been interest in the project if you would expect, and so it just a kind of a as I said a little bit of ripening here from -- ripening in the process and our thinking there's a little ripening left to go in terms of getting some of these, getting the clarity on the regulatory fund which again appears to be getting closer.","Brandon Blossman","Okay. Probably as expected the project screens are - almost screens for a JV partner here. As you think about in kind of prioritize or rank potential partners and project promotes back that accrue back to your part of the development, and this is a big open question, but how do you think through that process in terms of what you like to see in terms of getting paid for your development work here in terms of reducing your capital requirements in 2017, 2018, and early 2019 and being able to kind of return to getting cash back to shareholders. How do you balance all those pieces with that equation conceptually?","Steve Kean","Those are all three benefits, right, and agree with those, but we're really not for closing, we've got a lot of options in addition to having a good interest and we got a lot of options on how to proceed and a fair amount of work to do to figure out what the best option is, so we're keeping those options open and not really ready to refine that any further for you right now.","Brandon Blossman","Okay. Fair enough. But probably just noting the potential there and the opportunity that create more value near term rather than longer term. Okay, I'll leave that one to rest. Another broad question, surprises about 12 months ago from the rating agencies, how was those conversations kind of evolved over the last 12 months in terms of just level of comfort on the other side of the table as you continue to have those conversations with the rating agencies.","Kim Dang","I mean, if you think about where we were 12 months ago, where we are today. 12 months ago we were at 5.6 times debt to EBITDA and we had - we were paying out substantially all of our cash flow in the form of dividends. Today we're at 5.3 times and we are paying out a very small portion of our cash flow in terms of dividends and so I think we are in very good shape in our current rating.","Brandon Blossman","Okay, Understood. Thank you, Kim. And then last question from me. The MEP writedown, what triggers that process or that consideration?","Kim Dang","Yes. We just had some interest from various shippers and potentially working at contracts, when contracts on MEP have expired or will expire, and based on those conversations we felt like that the rates that we might get when the contracts expire, don't support the current that we have - we have that asset.","Brandon Blossman","All right, great. Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Good evening. Just a couple of quick ones from me, so we've had nice run in crude price recently and services costs have come down a lot this year. At this new lower service cost can you give a range of oil price at which you would be able to book new crude reserve at a level that approximates replacing production and I assume that numbers actually gotten much better from last year?","Steve Kean","[Jesse], do you want to add.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes, I think we add these projects throughout the year, so as price has improved, I would say, we're adding reserves today.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. Do you have a sense of if you would actually replace 100% of your production this year, what prices would have to be or even at range?","Kim Dang","Yes. I mean, we don't look at it that way. The way we look at it is look at a discrete project by project and we look after returns on the project that this year two groups bring forward, and if those returns clear our hurdle and the minimum amount of that hurdle is 15% unlevered after tax right now and if they clear that hurdle then we generally proceed with it and if they don't clear that hurdle at a minimum than generally we are not pursuing those projects.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. Understand. Thank you. And then my second question, exports to Mexico as you guys have noted have grown massively 3.3 Bcfd, I believe that you mentioned that the majority of that moves on Kinder Morgan pipeline. There are punch of new Mexico export pipes I think 3 Bcfd coming on in the first half of next year. Will that have a material impact on your fiscal flow of the segment EBITDA?","Steve Kean","I think that a given where our assets are positioned overall growth in Mexico export volumes are going to benefit us even if other people are building pipelines, an example of that would be NET pipeline that were in the service two years ago or so. And we deliver a substantial amount of gas into that pipeline and the reason for that is we have the infrastructure in Texas. We have the infrastructure on EPNG from West Texas through Arizona, so it\u2019s part of a larger grid and our piece of that grid is well positioned to benefit from the polling into Mexico that's happening increasing volumes over the year. So even if it\u2019s not us constructing in country place which we haven't gotten comfortable with from a risk rewards standpoint, the increase in demand and hooking it up, increasingly to U.S. supply sources is going to benefit our system overall, transport as well as storage and on the intrastate side sales.","Rich Kinder","And I think this sounds like a broken record, but we said it time and time again, this is one more demonstration of the strength that is inherent and having the kind of pipeline network on the natural gas side that we have which expand our producing arise and that interact connects with virtually every other pipeline system in America and that's going to pay dividends for many years to come.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Thanks. That's very helpful. And then, lastly are we close contracts minimum on gas gathering, so another thing is Eagle ford production continues to decline, there actually won't be much impact on Kinder Morgan?","Steve Kean","Yes. We've got roughly -- I don't think I can answer that question exactly. We get 30% of what we call our gathering and processing that's under take-or-pay contracts, but without looking at a kind of contract by contract I couldn't tell you whether - short answer is, we're not if those continued decline than we're not at the bottom, there would be a continued decline in our revenues, but we do have [some war] in our revenue because we got this 30% of the contracts are take-or-pay.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, great. Thanks. That's it from me.","Operator","Next question is from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you. Most of my questions have been hit. I did have one very quick follow-up on the Eagle Ford's volume - gathering volumes in general. You mentioned last quarter that you signed some incentive agreements that hopefully would have gotten some volumes in your system, was that suppose to be imminent here, was that something they expect to sort of be reflected in your volumes over time?","Steve Kean","Yes. We have successfully increased our market share from where we were sitting in the first and second quarters and those incentive contracts were a big part of that. And so we have if you will restore the market share that we had at the end of 2015 back to where we were, but we're still in the Eagle Ford, it\u2019s a market share of a declining overall base, and so the decline is [still calm], but I think that the program that Tom and his team initiated was successful in taking our market share backup.","Danilo Juvane","Got you. And with respect to the issues that you had with the MEP, are you seeing anything similar for other pipelines within your system?","Steve Kean","We have other pipes that are kind of what you call bases pipeline, FEP is another example and so pipes that are kind of point to point that had long term contracts that under wrote them when there were expanded as those contract roll off and bases has come in that would present the same kind of phenomenon.","Danilo Juvane","Do you guys have sort of magnitude of what the revenue impact or EBITDA impact would be going forward here?","Kim Dang","Well the FEP is not revenue issue in terms of what's the shippers are paying us, because those are take-or-pay contracts and I think the contracts go through 2019 or 2020 on FEP, I think it would just be as we figure out where we think exactly the market is whether you had a non-cash impairment on those assets. So the customers are still paying in fact the largest customer on FEP is South Western, I think they've actually put a rigor to back into the pay a bill and their credit situation I think has improved dramatically over the last few months.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for the color. Last question from me is the CO2 CapEx still trending at about $50 million or so quarterly?","Rich Kinder","Yes, we had - it\u2019s up a little bit from where we were, I think we were at about 210 million for the year, we're now about 249, 250, yes, 250.","Danilo Juvane","Okay. Thank you. That's it from me.","Operator","Next question is from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, Ted. How you're doing?","Ted Durbin","Doing well. Thanks, Rich. Coming back to Trans Mountain here, so maybe you can give us a little bit of preview on this ministerial penals report, I think it\u2019s due November 1st and kind of how that will impact the December decision and then also an update on the BC process meeting the five conditions and particular I think revenue showing one of the big ones there?","Rich Kinder","Yes. So there were couple of if you will additional federal processes, one was federal consultation process where the federal government was directly out consulting with first nations and communities. The one that you were specifically referring to was there was a three - a panel of three people appointed to go out and hear from the community, up and down the right-of-way and gather data or gather perspectives that hadn't been picked up in the NED proceeding. That process is wrapped up in terms of the hearing and as you pointed out there is a report that's due. It\u2019s a report that is cataloguing at least as I understand it, everything that the group of three heard while they were talking to people and the communities along the rights-of-way.","The federal - so those things feed into the federal decision, the order in council that comes out of the federal government which is still schedule for December 20th. So I don't know if anything Ted that inconsistent with the December 20th, certainly nothing that associated with those two processes. We still expect to see on or before December 20th, final order in council.","Ted Durbin","And then my other part of my question, that is a long one on the British Columbia process meeting the five conditions in their revenue sharing?","Steve Kean","We have been engaged with British Columbia on the five conditions. I think it's been constructive and productive engagement. We don't have anything final there. The other process that is going on in British Columbia is the EA order that they are going to issue around the same time as the federal decision. And at least in our thinking we are assuming that is in January - that that is not going to be in December, that that is going to be in January. And so I think what we are aiming for is to have the British Colombia conditions as well as that environmental order resolved and complete early next year.","Ted Durbin","Okay, great. And then I know you have been back and forth with the contractors, just any updates on the cost side and overall so the project return is still inline what you had originally budgeted?","Steve Kean","Project returns are still inline. We are still working on the costs with the contractors. We have made very good progress I would say, but we are not final yet and we are still a complicated project. There is still work to be done there but I think we have made good progress.","Ted Durbin","Okay. I will leave it at that. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Good afternoon guys.","Steve Kean","Hi Shneur.","Shneur Gershuni","I just wanted to confirm your response to one of the earlier questions, I think it was Brian\u2019s question about retain distributable cash flow, I just want to make sure I understood it correctly, let us say you are at a run rate of just using random numbers here $4.5 million in distributable cash flow, and I think if I heard you correctly you talked about potentially holding back about $2 billion of that retained DCF to fund the equity portion of kind of normalized growth CapEx budget?","Steve Kean ","No, you didn't hear me correctly. Let me - what I said was we would hold back and certainly we would expect that 4.5 run rate today to increase as new projects come online. But what I said was we would hold back the amount necessary to fund the equity portion of normalized CapEx expenditure for the year. So for example, we would think that will depend on what kind of projects you have, but we think historically that has been between $2 billion and $3 billion a year. So you to think the midpoint of that, it is $2.5 billion, you would be withholding $1.25 billion out of that $4.5 billion or $5 billion of distributable cash flow. ","So it is not the whole thing because once we get to the level - the appropriate level of debt we would intend to go back to financing half equity, half debt, but the difference is we would not put - we would not contemplate putting out new equity. We would be using retained cash flow from operations to fund the \u201cequity\u201d portion of that. Does that answer your question now?","Shneur Gershuni","Yes, I think we are actually on the same page. So if I do my math correctly, I mean that is a very significant increase in the dividend from where you are today, which I think is running at about $1.1 billion or $1.2 billion, am I thinking about that correctly and corresponds with your well of a difference comment earlier?","Steve Kean ","Yes, that would be, of course, a significant difference, right.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. The second question, I know that you have been asked this many different ways, but I realize the company has made considerable progress of getting down to your stated goal of 5x net debt to EBITDA. I guess kind of two questions in one here, but has that leverage goal impacted your ability to consider some growth projects, and then secondly given all the questions about returning to a higher level of dividends, is the board considering any options to accelerate the pace to the 5x leverage goal either through equity or preferred issuances, or even asset sales, or is the board comfortable with the pace where you are at and you will get there when you expect to get there?","Kim Dang","So, let me answer and I think my answer to the first will address the answer to the second question, which is the reason that we decreased the dividend primarily a year ago had to do with inefficient capital markets and not wanting to fund expansion CapEx in a market that wasn't rationally pricing debt and equity securities. And so, I think the debt market has changed, the equity market is still significantly different from where we were 12 months ago, 18 months ago.","And so we are funding our CapEx program. So in my mind what we are constrained by we do want to improve the balance sheet, and that is a goal that we have, but what we are doing is we are living within our cash flow meaning that we want to be able to fund our equity - our CapEx apex and our dividend from our cash flow. And so that is the constraint and so because we have limited amount of capital that is why we have the hurdle rate set at 15% unlevered after-tax for project. I fully anticipate that over time as the CapEx ex comes down and also as the balance sheet improves that we would relax that standard. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be today, but it would be something less than the 15%. It probably won't be back at the 8% unlevered after-tax that we previously used for hurdle rate, but we would have to make the assessment when that time comes.","Shneur Gershuni","And so you are comfortable with the pace that you are at or would you consider options to accelerate getting there?","Steve Kean","Well, if you mean issuing equity, we are not an equity issuer at these prices.","Kim Dang","And that was why that we are living within cash flow given where the current equity prices are.","Steve Kean","But look, we are going as fast as we can. If we can find ways to go faster we will. And we are working on this all the time as you might imagine. But it is just a question the particular method that you identified as distinguished from attractive joint ventures for example and other ways of accelerating us getting there, that approach that is issuing equity is not attractive at today's prices.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, fair enough and one final question, we have seen a spike in global coalprices recently and I know you have had some challenges at your terminals over the last two years, has there been any increase or increase in terms of folks wanting to ship out coal in bulk out of the U.S. or is it still too early to see the benefit from the recent increases that we have seen in coal prices globally?","Steve Kean","We saw actually a 13% up tick last quarter in our coal volumes mostly on the export side. On a U.S. basis, exports were down 11.8%. That is just a drop in the bucket. We are still down 30% on a year-over-year basis. The prices - we have seen some price compression, margins did spike up, but we don't anticipate that going significantly higher. The forecast for this year is still tracking at about 59 million tons of export and that is comparable to 74 million tons last year. It is not projected a lot higher than that.","Shneur Gershuni","So you have got some ground to make up?","Steve Kean","Yes.","Shneur Gershuni","All right. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","The next question is from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Darren, how are you?","Darren Horowitz","I am fine. Thank you Rich. I hope you and the team are doing well. I will be quick Rich, you and Steve mentioned the permitting challenges and obviously the Connecticut expansion of TGP comes to mind, I'm just thinking systemically, what impact do you think these permitting challenges are going to have specifically on the northeast gas market when you reconcile the amount of marketed pipe capacity versus what you said you expect in Marcellus and your production growth expectations to be, do you think it is a rescaling of marketed pipe or a combination of pipes, and I am most interested to know your thoughts on maybe some basis differential expectations, more pressure in the hub, but most importantly how you capitalize on it through scaling up TGP?","Steve Kean","Okay. A lot loaded in there, but basically I think our view is it is very hard to get big new builds done into New England or into the northeast, and we have seen that not only with [any deal], which we talked about in the first quarter and discontinued, but also with recent rulings that verified that decision. It is making it harder to get things done on kind of a megascale. Now we have continued to engage with our customers on smaller scale projects and will continue to pursue those.","But I think from the perspective of right now today it is hard to get new significant gas infrastructure built into New England and now with the intent to increase the basis differentials between what is already the lowest priced gas, dominion south, call it, and the New England market which is the highest priced in North America and just a few hundred miles away. So barring some improvement in that overall permitting environment I think it is difficult to do those, but we will keep looking for the smaller projects to do. The other thing I think New England is a perfect example of what Rich said at the very beginning, which is that, it does tend to make the existing network more valuable.","The other thing I would add and let Tom throw in whatever he wants, but the TGP system is a system that is continuing to produce project opportunities for us. A lot of our backlog on TGP - a lot of our backlog in gas is on TGP. I mean it is the biggest home for it outside of the Elba project right now, and what a lot of that project capital is directed at now is getting the gas as you know Darren, South from the Marcellus and Utica to the new market, the new market area, which is now the Gulf Coast of the United States.","And we are proceeding along very well with those. We are building on our existing footprint that again goes to the need to make distinctions between projects out there and infrastructure projects, building off of our existing footprint, adding compression, maybe laying some parallel pipe, things like that that created different - that is a different - in a federally certificated process that is a different context in which to be doing your project expansions. So I think you will see bases widen to New England to the northeast, and I think we will find plenty of things to invest in [Indiscernible] plenty of things to invest in on TGP to get that gas someplace else. ","Darren Horowitz","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMC. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder ","Okay. You are back on.","Jeremy Tonet","Sorry about that. Thanks for taking me. Going back to TMX here, I was just wondering if you could help me think through some things here as far as, if there is any target as far as what the right ownership would be for this, and when you are talking about the JV here, is this just the extension or the extension of the existing pipe, I guess what it comes back to is when I am thinking - trying to model 5x debt to EBITDA, the spend on TMX and the drag associated with when the cash flow materialize is a pretty big variable in that equation. So I am just wondering if you could help me think through that.","Steve Kean","Okay, there are a number of things in there, but I think yes the project is hard to separate from the underlying assets to answer the simplest one of your questions there. On the -- on the approach on what the ownership percentage would be and more of the details I'll go back to the earlier answer, which is we have a lot of options and we're going to pursue the most valuable ones, that\u2019s the easiest way I can characterize it. And we don't have to do anything which is a great position to be in, but we are going to evaluate it.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Great, that's helpful. And then if I heard you correctly let me know if I\u2019m wrong as far as you know when in the regulatory process it might make sense to proceed with the JV if the terms makes sense, it's kind of earlier next year when you see if things progress to schedule, that could kind of come to fruition at that point.","Steve Kean","Yes that's a good point to be looking at it when we see the regulatory clarity because I think investors would like to see that too and so I think that's a reasonable point for us to be examining it.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. Thanks for that, that's it for me.","Operator","Next question is from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Steve Kean","Good afternoon.","Craig Shere","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the extended call here. So a couple of questions here, one, you know Rich, you commented about the historical you know annual run rate call it about $2.5 billion a year, I know we have some take in the Python issues with Trans Mountain and other such items that may be JV, but I guess my question is as we think about lowering the hurdle rate for new projects from 15% perhaps to the very low double-digits, do you see the capacity in this current market that really filled in for that kind of ongoing investment opportunity when year-to-date you've only filled in $575 million?","Rich Kinder","Well I think again, we would just have to look at what the environment is at that particular point in time, and these things do vary from year-to-year but we look back over several years and it's our call at this time, and against a preliminary outlook as I stress, but that annual burn rate if you will of expansion CapEx is something in the range we talked about. And that's what -- what we would want to use as providing enough coverage we made for the \u201cequity portion\u201d of that burn rate, and I think that almost stationary or that leaves a lot of many to pay dividends but we just look at the exact circumstances when we reach that point.","Craig Shere","Understood. Is there any color about how much you have left on the table because it didn't meet your hurdle rate, because of the significant balance sheet management that this really helped a lot in the last two three four quarters. Any kind of color on what you've already left on the table because of that discipline that maybe when in a better market might be there in the future?","Rich Kinder","No, I don't know that we left anything on the table Craig. We did elevate our return hurdle criteria, but we have continued to say, look if there's something that our business units think makes sense, we got a good customer, good counter party credit, long-term contracts confidence around execution center. We want to -- we want to bring it in to talk about it and we continue to see those come forward.","I think, the one place that we took a closer look again with CO2 and we -- and certainly in the oil price environment we saw earlier in the year, we took projects off the table and now we're adding those back as we see oil prices recover. So look is there something, or there are some things that we might have been able to do if we were in an 8% world that we're not doing when we were 15% world, then yes maybe so, but I think well what we're talking about in the longer term is a return hurdles that we will relax off of the 15% as Kim said, and I think given the network that we have will still find those opportunities off our network and we're finding some of them still today.","Craig Shere","Understood. And on MEP, was there some specific kind of ongoing revenue or EBITDAS drag or reduction expected apart from the one-time non cash right down.","Kim Dang","If you're asking if we\u2019ve had any changes on the underlying contracts at MEP? No, there have been no underlying changes. This is based on the impairment is largely based on informed by discussions with customers of rates that we can get when contracts expire.","Craig Shere","Understood. And on the Jones Act, tankers Steven and any more color you can provide there and your comments about the size or duration of the moves. I think you still have American liberty and American pride, you have the contracts, is that correct? And any update about charters rolling over the next couple of years?","Steve Kean","Yes, we have two ships that are not yet constructed and those are the only two of the 14 that are currently not chartered. They are the only two of the 16, and they are not currently charted, everything else is -- that there's one that's under a shorter term charter that\u2019s rolling into a long term charter. Everything is chartered; we do have some coming up in one or two in 2017, three in 2017.","Rich Kinder","And we had a real strong year there, we are up $12 million on the base, mostly due to less off higher and higher rates and then the expansions are another $25.7 million. If you look kind of going forward the risk really is we got $11 million that are under long-term agreement and then $5 million that could be impacted at some point or another, remember it's about 15% of the total earnings for that -- for that group.","Craig Shere","Okay, that's very good color, thank you. And then on that there was a question about Trans Mountain cost, I just want to confirm I mean historically all said that if we bumped up against that upper limit of what they are takers were required to accept Canadian dollars if we punch through that, that there were still significant shipper interest and if conditions were that you punched through that a little bit, that the expectation would be that there would be plenty of still interest and you wouldn't be too worried about that.","Is that still the case that, whatever comes you got to do your best to keep cost down, but the shipper interest is there?","Steve Kean","There's good strong super into something outside of the current shippers. And so yes we still -- we still believe that. Now having said that, we are working very hard to keep our overall costs down and to be within the cap and we're making good progress, but yes, we do believe that they're strong enough, there is strong shipper interests outside of the existing shippers.","Craig Shere","Great. And then last question from me, it's kind of a bigger picture, but -- but the -- the [industry don't] want to call it industry, the activism out there that's made it difficult to put on new projects has also started impacting existing projects and that is called into question, what kind of ongoing cost there are for surveillance and security, can you comment on those trends and any issues impacting the industry?","Steve Kean","I think it's the same general comment which is we have to take all of those kinds of things into account in scheduling and costing our projects. And it includes additional public outreach. It also includes taking into account security measures that that may be needed. So it's about adapting to that new environment and that's what we are actively doing.","Craig Shere","Okay thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Becca Followill from U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is now open.","Steve Kean","Afternoon, Becca","Becca Followill","Afternoon. Three questions for you, one on Utopia back to back. Do you have a timing on the appeals? And, and how many counties have you sued the land owners?","Steve Kean","A timing on the appeal, we've asked for an expedited appeal, so we're waiting to see if that\u2019s granted and then they would have to set a schedule and so I don't have a specific answer on that, but it would be months, it would be months to get the appeal ultimately resolved.","And Ron, in terms of the number of counties where we've got [Indiscernible] suits its probably, nearly every county on the \u2026","Tom Martin","Several of the counties. And we\u2019ve as is typical all of our projects we tried to avoid use of eminent domain, we negotiate with respect with landowners and as Steve and Rich indicated we\u2019re about 65% just through gaming these months without any eminent domain. So we continue to work that effort while we feel this one County effort, and what happens in other counties, well that remains to be seen.","Rich Kinder","Well the other judges of course have ruled the other way off\u2026","Becca Followill","Well there have been counties that [have ruled] the opposite direction?","Rich Kinder","Yes.","Becca Followill","In Ohio.","Rich Kinder","Yes, yes.","Steve Kean","And including at the appellate level.","Becca Followill","With the appellate level on, was that on surveying, or was on eminent domain?","Steve Kean","It was an eminent domain.","Becca Followill","Okay, Are there different districts that you have to go through is different for different county rules or is it all in one district and which district is it?","Steve Kean","No, it's a county-by-county. This is a county, the county court system, state county court system in each county and then there are appellate districts in the ultimately the Ohio Supreme Court.","Becca Followill","But you are appealing through a district court?","Steve Kean","We're appealing to a court of appeals.","Becca Followill","But do you know which district?","Steve Kean","I don\u2019t know what the number is.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you. I\u2019ll track it down. Second on the timing to finalize the cost of the Trans Mountain expansion, I would seem you have to have that in hand before you could do a JB?","Steve Kean","Yes, and we have to - I don't remember the exact timeframe but we do deliver it to the shippers following the respective acceptable approvals. And so there's a some relatively short window time within which we go to that.","Becca Followill","So that would also be in January then?","Steve Kean","It\u2019s the sixth that Ron informs me, it\u2019s the six district court of appeals.","Becca Followill","Okay","Steve Kean","Going back, what was your other questions Becca on\u2026","Becca Followill","It would be January, also timing.","Steve Kean","First quarter, let\u2019s say first quarter.","Becca Followill","Okay. And then finally on Yates, seemed like a fairly big sequential pick down and production there, was there anything unusual that was going on?","Steve Kean","Yes, couple of things. We deferred a couple of projects earlier in the year and then we had a power outage in the quarters that significantly attracted fields so, nothing major be honest as\u2026","Becca Followill","And how much the power outage affect the field in terms of production can you quantify?","Rich Kinder","I have to get back to you on that.","Becca Followill","Okay. Great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey Rich, appreciate the time tonight. Just had a couple clarification questions, I guess, to start that kind of model question. Kim, I think I heard you say in your prepared remarks that full year sustaining CapEx would be within its 4% of the initial budget. I\u2019m wondering that I think the original budget was 570-574, so I was just looking at the final page of your release tonight. And it I just wanted to I guess figure out the reconciliation of that comment if I heard you correctly or not. And then the five, the 455 listed in the last page just what I should be using kind of what is the number?","Kim Dang","Well the original budget was $574 and will be within 4% of that number.","Chris Sighinolfi","Of that number, okay.","Rich Kinder","4% percent better in other words\u2026.","Kim Dang","Better, less.","Chris Sighinolfi","Yes, no I understood there\u2019s a lot of improvement you guys have made there. I knew it was going to be under, I just didn't know that 455 spoke to larger magnitude, so I'll follow up maybe with David about what this table represents, but I just want to clarify for our model what the number should be.","I guess second question for me, [oil curves] moved up significantly since the last call, curious if any additional hedging activity had taken place and if you could maybe give me just a quick rundown of where you stand?","Kim Dang","Sure, on that on the hedges and this is 2017, we've got and I'm going to give you barrels now because I think that is easier for everybody's models and giving you percentages. And so on barrels we've got twenty-four thousand four hundred barrels hedged for 2017, 13,700 for 2018, 6100 for 2019 and 2300 for 2020. And the 17 barrels that I just gave you include roughly seventeen hundred barrels of NGLs and to give you the prices that go along with that 2017 at $62, 2018 is $66, 2019 is $58 and 2020 is $51.","Chris Sighinolfi","Perfect. Super helpful.","Kim Dang","And the prices include the NGL volumes.","Chris Sighinolfi","Right, right okay. And I guess the final question from me Kim is just a lot of questions on TMX, obviously appreciate the color on the project procedural past potential for partners. I just, I guess as it relates to your historical cadence around guidance, just given that that's normally early December and a lot of this seems like it will be decided either late December, early January just what we should be expecting from you if anything different than normal?","Steve Kean","In terms of getting guidance later in the year with all the moving parts of the first quarter.","Chris Sighinolfi","Yes, precisely yes.","Steve Kean","Yes, so we haven't even started reviving [indiscernible] going through our budget process for 2017. And so we normally decide if, when and how to guide when we are deeper it -- will actually when we are completed with that process. So don't have an answer for you yet Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Well thanks for all the time guys.","Steve Kean","Thanks.","Operator","I\u2019m sorry. Next question is from Faisel Khan from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, Faisel how are you this afternoon.","Faisel Khan","Hi, okay thanks good evening. In terms of the TMX again, can negotiations with your contractors extend beyond the end of the year or are you expecting that to be done by end of the year?","Steve Kean","I would expect there'll be stuff being negotiated with contractors all the way along through the project frankly, but the bulk of it will be done by the time we communicate to the customers obviously, so early next year.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And then the increased contributions let's talk about the quarter from the Highland mid to Highland Midstream assets. What exactly is that associated with, was that associated with higher volumes or if there's something else going on there on the midstream\u2026..","Steve Kean","No it was shifting contracts from commodity sensitive contract structures where you know we were getting a percentage of proceeds to locking in the fee and giving the producer the commodity upside. And so the producer was happy with the commodity upside and we were happy to lock in and secure a stable cash flow.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And that caused an increase in the EBITDA in this quarter.","Steve Kean","Yes. Really through for the year too.","Faisel Khan","Got it. And then the hedges Kim that you described in the call right now, are those hedge amounts for next year, does it look a little bit lower than what you would normally be at this time of year in terms of our percentage of volume basis?","Kim Dang","We are within our hedging program.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And the tax expense you talked about for SMG, is that just related to the deferred tax assets of the entire companies or is that just a reflection of a change in the DTA for you guys.","Kim Dang","No. It's a reflection of the fact that we don't book deferred taxes on non-deductible goodwill.","Faisel Khan","Okay, okay that makes sense. Okay, it\u2019s all I had guys. Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Rich Kinder","Hey, Jonathan, how are you doing?","John Edwards","I\u2019m doing good. I'll try to keep this really brief. Just can you remind us on Trans Mountain, what that CapEx cap is? And then if you can remind us how much arm you've invested in Trans Mount to date?","Steve Kean","It's a $6.8 billion is the Canadian -- is the is the capital amount. And by the end of the year it will be a little under $600 million invested, but keep in mind that there's a Canadian yes, and keep in mind that we -- that's a gross number and we collect what we call firm 50 fees, this is firm capacity across the dock and there's $250 million worth of firm 50 fees that go to offset that development cost.","So the net number and now that isn't all matchup in time. That's extended over a 10-year period, but $250 million with the development costs is funded through the firm 50 fees.","Rich Kinder","And then beyond that is of course we have explained before, we have commitments from the shippers for a portion of this in the event that the project would not go far, so it's not like all of this is on our [indiscernible] I think Steve's explained that the past.","John Edwards","Okay, so if it doesn't go forward, approximately what percentage basically you have been\u2026.","Steve Kean","Varies, depending on the reason, but it's generally no less than 80% is borne by the shippers.","John Edwards","Okay, that's helpful. And then the December 20th, is that you expect that to be is that literally a go\/no-go or is there some other decision that could come out of that?","Steve Kean","It\u2019s a decision and we don't know if it's going to have additional conditions or affirm the [NAVs] existing 157 conditions or so. So it's not a -- but it will be, it is expected to be as for example in the Northern Gateway case, the order in council is a definitive decision about whether they view the pop the project is being in the public convenience and necessity so it will be definitive from that standpoint, we would expect plus there\u2019s something very different here. We\u2019d expect them to make that determination definitively.","John Edwards","Okay, so that that becomes effectively the go\/no go is this public\u2026","Steve Kean","I\u2019m not clear what you mean by go\/no-go\u2026","John Edwards","I mean, I mean like you get a decision, I mean does that mean your face for example they did not find it's in the public convene, it's not a project found in the interest of the public for convenience and necessity would you in effect at that point have to cancel the project now if they find you'll get a certificate as a public convenience and necessity, but they have some conditions, I'm presuming them, the project for all practical purposes definitely goes forward that's what I'm just trying to figure out.","Steve Kean","Yes and so on the going forward decision, there are the other elements that I spoke to. We've got to get the BC resolution go through the final contractor and customer community communications all of which we expect to happen fairly shortly after the federal order.","The federal order could be a range of things, I mean naturally we think we made a very good case, and we've -- we think we've done better even than past applications in terms of meeting the requirements that the government has laid out. So we're certainly advocating for and expecting will find it determination that it is in the public convenience and necessity, but it could also have additional conditions and we'd have to examine what those conditions are and what impact they have on the project.","And to your point, yes they could determine that it's not and that we have to decide what our next steps were from that point.","John Edwards","Okay. And then switching over to the JV possibilities. Given that the customers are effectively funding a portion of this on a JV, would they be eligible to participate in any same markup on that. I mean how much sharing would go on with the customers\u2026","Steve Kean","There's no -- there's no sharing on that. It's -- but we're also again that being specific about who might want to be a participant. Yes, yes again this isn't yes if we pursue the JV.","John Edwards","Okay, so I\u2019m presuming it wouldn't be fair to presume that there's a fair number of the customers that would want to be.","Steve Kean","I -- wouldn't yes I wouldn't I wouldn't lean into that John. I think that they are generally in different businesses than owning pipelines if you look at this rate of customers. So I'm just not precluding any potential option there.","John Edwards","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. That\u2019s it from me, thanks so much.","Operator","Our last question from the queue is from [Indiscernible] from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","[Indiscernible]","Kim Dang","Thank you. In terms of you can expect that it would be at five times or potentially better depending on what decision we make when we get to that point.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thanks for that. And then just one clarification with regard to your interstate pipelines, I was wondering what kind of interest you are seeing on some of the re-contracting for those pipelines, I think in GPL especially had some contracts which were coming up for renewal, any color on that?","Rich Kinder","Yes I mean, I would say overall we've got good interest in good rates, we were contract tender really has gone and increased over the course of the year and then why would it think about in GPLs it really has, it touches all the major demand and supply areas that are engaged in the market right now, whether it be LNG, whether it be [indiscernible] petrochemical growth and those whether it be certainly Marcellus, Utica and even the Permian we are seeing some action out west as well so, good prospects along as you go.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks guys.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you all very much. Have a good evening. I know everybody is going to [scurry] home to watch the big debate tonight. But you should be reading your Kinder Morgan information instead. Thank you and have a good evening.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode for the duration of today's conference. This call is being recorded, if you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Today's call will feature a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Now, I will turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Jeremy, and welcome to our second quarter call. As usual, we may be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.","I'll give a brief overview, then Steve Kean, our CEO, will talk about the quarter's performance and give you an update on our project backlog, and then, as usual, Kim Dang, our CFO will give you all the financial details and then we will take any and all questions that you may have.","We raised the dividend to $0.49 for the second quarter. We're on track to meet our target of delivering -- of declaring $2 for full year 2015 with substantial excess coverage, even after adjusting for the current commodity prices. And we expect to grow our dividends by 10% each year from 2016 through 2020.","It's difficult to compare this quarter with the second quarter of 2014 because of course we completed our merger of all the Kinder Morgan entities only in November of last year. But that said, let me share what I believe are some relative numbers with you.","In this quarter, we had approximately 2.2 billion shares outstanding versus about 1.034 billion in the second quarter a year ago. We declared a dividend of $0.49 versus $0.43 a year ago.","We had DCF per share of $0.50 this quarter versus $0.32 a year ago. We had excess coverage in this quarter of $20 million versus a shortfall of about $113 million in the second quarter last year. And year-to-date for 2015, we've had excess coverage of $226 million versus $25 million for the first half of 2014.","In terms of total DCF, in this quarter, we had 1.095 billion versus 332 million in 2014. Very importantly, we've increased substantially our backlog of future projects, as Steve will explain and we think we're looking at a bright future for natural gas demand.","As an example of the increasing demand, the power generation throughput on our set of natural gas pipelines was up 16% for the first quarter -- for the second quarter compared with second quarter of 2014. I might add anecdotally, that's pretty consistent.","In Texas, the overall demand for gas as a source of power generation increased its share year-to-date to 48% from 37% in the first half of 2014.","I think all of these factors and the numbers I've shared with you just demonstrate our belief that the strength of our assets, even in times of volatile and relatively low commodity prices, continue to demonstrate that we can produce stellar results even in these times.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right, thanks, Rich. So, I'll take the projects for you and give you some operating highlights from the segment. Since the April update our project backlog increased by $3.7 billion from $18.3 billion to $22 billion. That's great progress and a sign of the strength of our network and the continuing need for additional midstream energy infrastructure.","This was fixing to be an even bigger increase but for some delays on a couple of deals that we've been working on worth about another $1 billion. If and when we get those done, we'll announce those separately.","Now, here are the main changes. We added $4.6 billion in new projects. And this is an important one, $3.3 billion of that is the addition of the market path portion of Northeast Energy Direct, a natural gas pipeline expansion to serve the New England market.","We're expecting to proceed with that project. We're still working on the supply portion of that project. And we've made significant recent head way on that one, as well, but not to the point where we're ready to add it to the backlog. When and if we do, that would be another $1.6 billion to $2.1 billion.","Now going back to the market path portion, we have discussed in previous releases that we've got commitments for 562 a day of capacity on that project. Much of that volume is currently going through the state Public Utility Commission review process and we're optimistic about the outcome of those reviews.","We're comfortable going forward, based on the commitments we have and the progress toward the state approvals on those commitments. Number two, our confidence that we can extract value for short-term sales of a portion of the unsold capacity, particularly during the winter months. And third, just the overwhelming need for additional gas capacity to serve Northeast markets.","This level of sign-up would get us to an accretive return, but we fully expect to add commitments on the power side that will get us to a very attractive return. We preserve the ability to phase this project in as the commitments come. We're very enthusiastic about the project. The demand is already there and growing.","Besides NED, we added $700 million of investments to the Elba Island liquefaction project primarily as a result of buying out Shell and taking 100% of the ownership and management of that project. Shell remains the off-taker for 100% of the project capacity under a 20-year contract.","This deal represents a restructuring of the current arrangement -- previous arrangement that we had with Shell. The main benefits we are getting here are, of course, the opportunity to invest $2.1 billion at an attractive return. And, secondly, we get control of the project and with that control we still expect a late 2017 in-service date. Shell benefits from secured cost reductions on the total project, which we expect to achieve and still earn an attractive return on the all-in investment.","In other portions of the backlog we also added $100 million in other projects in the gas group, $100 million combined between products and terminals, about $300 million in additional EOR investments over the time frame of the backlog in the CO2 segment.","So, those are the additions and during this timeframe we put into service $700 million worth of projects. The bulk of that explained by two things, $200 million relating to four further expansions and extensions of our very successful Kinder Morgan crude and condensate system serving the Eagle Ford Shale and multiple destination markets on the Texas Gulf Coast.","We also put into service $300 million of projects in the terminals segment. The majority of that is attributable to our Edmonton crude-by-rail joint venture with Imperial which was placed in service during the quarter.","We removed about $600 million from the backlog. Nearly all of that is further deferrals in our CO2 source field investments, outside the timeframe of the backlog. Part of this reduction is also related to scope efficiency where we are getting the same production with a smaller investment.","We continue to believe that we can meet the current demand outlook for CO2 by concentrating our source development activities on the core of our portfolio. So, overall we grew the backlog by $3.7 billion even while putting $700 million worth of projects into service. And, as I mentioned, we think we're close to adding still more.","Now, for the segment review. But before going into the segment-by-segment review, I think it's worth backing up for a moment and comparing where we were in Q2 of 2014 and where we are in Q2 of 2015.","Over that period, the price of WTI declined by 48% and the price of natural gas declined by 43%. But in this quarter, we're reporting segment earnings before DD&A that are up 2% and we're reporting volumes that are up, and I'll go through those separately.","Certainly there are a lot of moving pieces in there including capital investments we've made, the commodity price impact on CO2, et cetera. But it still sets a very important context for our performance and for the strength of our business model in a wide variety of commodity environments.","All right, now for the segments, starting with gas. Earnings before DD&A for the gas pipeline segment were $965 million, that's up 1% year-over-year. That's led by the addition of Hiland and improved year-over-year performance on the Eagle Hawk gathering system, offsetting weaker performance in some of our other gathering and processing assets.","Also recall that year-over-year results in this segment are affected by a major shipper buying out of its contract on the Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline last year.","We had higher transport volumes, up 3% across the segment and we saw a 16% increase year-over-year, as Rich mentioned, in the power burn across our systems. We had higher sales volumes, up 9% on our Texas intrastate as we continue to see growth in our power and industrial markets in Texas.","Gas gathering volumes were also up 5%. We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity. Now, this is including the 562 associated with NED, but we added over the quarter 1.4 BCF of additional long-term transportation commitments, with the volume weighted average term length of about 20 years.","And we added commitments in the East, Central and West regions and across LNG, LDC and producer markets. Over 400 of that is attributable to sales at existing capacity, showing again that we benefit from rising gas supply and demand not only in terms of new project opportunities, but also enhancing the values in some of our existing systems.","So that 1.4 BCF addition brings the total capacity sign ups since December of 2013 to 8.7 BCF of new and pending long-term commitments.","So, again, the summary here for gas is we continue to see strong demand for existing and expansion capacity in our gas assets. And we believe that we're well positioned for the growth that we see in this market.","Turning to CO2 which is, of course, very much affected by commodity prices, segment earnings before DD&A in this segment were $286 million, down $74 million or 21% year-over-year due to lower commodity prices for oil and NGLs and including the deteriorating ratio of NGL to crude prices. Our volumes are up year-over-year, led by SACROC at 9%, and an overall increase of 8% net to Kinder Morgan across all of our enhanced oil recovery developments.","Katz and Goldsmith are also up year-over-year and, of course, reported at 8% that I just mentioned. And we've made recent significant progress on Goldsmith, in particular, but we're still well under plan on both of those fields.","We're also extracting some significant cost savings in this price environment. We continue to forecast reductions in OpEx and maintenance CapEx of just under 25% for the year.","Now turning to the products pipeline group, segment earnings before DD&A were $275 million, up 32% year-over-year. And that's driven by the ramp up of volumes on KMCC, the addition of our HH pipeline with the Hiland acquisition, and improved performance on FFPP, as well as better year-over-year results on Cochin. Recall that Cochin was shut down for part of the quarter last year as we were completing the reversal project.","In this segment, we see the upside of lower commodity prices. Our refined products volumes were up 4% across all of our systems year-over-year year in aggregate, led by higher gasoline volumes, particularly on our SSPP system.","We continued to advance our Palmetto refined products pipeline, our Utopia NGL pipeline projects. We also launched an open season on UMTP proposed pipeline closing in September of this year, but we still don't have that project in our backlog.","Now, we did suffer a setback on our Palmetto project. The Georgia Department of Transportation denied our request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. We did get the approval we needed from FERC during the quarter. A favorable ruling from Georgia DOT is not essential for us to proceed with the project, but we are appealing the ruling because it would help, and we're exploring all of our routing options to allow us to move forward with the project.","Turning to terminals now, segment earnings before DD&A were $271 million, up 16% from last year. 75% of that is attributable to organic growth. We continue to see strong performance in our liquids facilities. And our earnings benefited from expansions in Edmonton and the Houston ship channel, as well as higher year-over-year results due to our Jones Act tanker acquisition.","We placed our Edmonton crude-by-rail facility into service, as I mentioned. On the bulk side, a different story, steel volumes are lower as are coal volumes. This segment was also hit by FX on the Canadian portion of its operations.","The liquids part of the segment, in addition to its strong performance in our existing business, is also driving our future opportunities. Almost -- really every bit of our backlog in this business is in the liquids part of the business.","As we continue to see promising opportunities in the Houston ship channel, which we are actively pursuing, some of those are in the backlog, there are others that we're pursuing that are not yet in there.","We've built great positions in two very important hubs, Edmonton and Houston. In Edmonton, our expansion projects, when complete, will bring our merchant crude storage positions to 12 million barrels, the largest in the area, and up from zero ten years ago. In Houston, our expansions will get us to 43 million barrels of liquid fuel storage, 45 when you count our recent Vopak acquisition.","So, we continue to build strong positions in these two markets. And, very importantly, we continue to add connectivity to our assets in each of those markets which further enhances the value of our positions there.","Finally, Kinder Morgan Canada and a quick update on our expansion of Trans Mountain. First, we're still expecting to see draft conditions by the end of this month from the NEB, so that's fast approaching. We do expect to get the final NEB recommendation in order in January of 2016.","Intervener evidence was filed during the quarter and is fully expected and as some of you probably read; it lit up the press as the opposition got plenty of air play. This wasn't any surprise to us, and our Canadian team continues to do its job, fulfilling their outreach and consultation responsibilities.","Most of our route, as a reminder, is along our current pipeline, except where community or land owner needs dictated a variation. So, we have existing relationships with many of the communities and First Nations along the way. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have community benefits agreements in place that cover 87% of the route.","We also have agreements with about a third of the First Nations that are most directly affected by the project. We're working to get more. Progress is slower than we would like on getting the expressions of support, but we are fulfilling the obligation we have to consult and accommodate in any case. I'll remind you that the expansion is under long-term contracts which have been approved by the NEB.","So, overall, we think it was a very good quarter with strong performance in a very significantly lower commodity price environment year-over-year. And we made several strong additions to the backlog, and overall I think demonstrates the value of our network and the continuing opportunities to expand off that network.","So, that's it for the segment and for the projects, and with that I'll turn it over to Kim for the numbers.","Kim Dang","Sure. Thanks, Steve. Turning to the first page of numbers which is the GAAP income statement, let me just point out a couple of things on this page. You can see that in the quarter, similar to last quarter, revenues are down significantly $474 million. But you can also see that OpEx is down by almost the exact same amount, $475 million.","As I said last quarter, a change in revenues is not a good predictor of our performance. We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not.","We believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash that we generate, which metric we look at DCF per share and the cash that we pay our investors which is the dividend per share.","So, with that I'll turn to the second page and look at DCF. DCF before certain items in the quarter, $1.095 billion, up $763 million or 230%. Now, that is largely a function of not paying the limited partners as a result of the Fusion transaction.","But it doesn't take into account the shares that we had to issue, the approximately 1.1 billion shares that we had to issue in the transaction. So, if you look at it on a per share basis, it takes into account both aspects of the transaction, and so we generated DCF in the quarter of $0.50, that's up $0.18 or 56% from the second quarter a year ago and year-to-date DCF is $1.07, which is up 23% from the six months ended June 2014.","So, our dividend in this quarter of $0.49 gives us coverage of $20 million year-to-date and we have coverage -- the $1.07 covers the $0.97 dividend by $226 million and obviously, as Rich mentioned $20 million in coverage in this quarter versus $113 million deficit in the second quarter of 2014.","Looking up at the segments, we generated segment earnings before DD&A of $1.827 billion, that's up $35 million or about 2%. Steve has taken you through each of the segments and what's driving that change, year-to-date the segment earnings before DD&A up $28 million or 1%.","But I do want to take you through where we are expecting the segment to come out versus our budget for the full year. We expect gas to exceed its budget about 1% versus budget, largely as a result of the Hiland transaction.","And then some of the benefit from the Hiland transaction is being offset by direct commodity exposure, for which we gave you the metric at the beginning of the year, and about $35 million in lower volume as a result of lower commodity prices.","CO2 versus our budget for the full year, we're expecting that to come in in the range of about 13% below its budget and that's all a function of price. There are other moving factors which largely offset each other.","And the other things that offset each other, we have cost savings in the segment which are being offset by lower CO2 volume and also lower capitalized overhead of CO2 spending, about $450 million less than what we originally budgeted.","Products pipeline we expect to exceed its budget, largely as a result of the Double H Pipeline which came in the Hiland acquisition. The benefit from that has a small offset from commodity prices consistent with the metrics that we gave you at the beginning of the year.","I should go back and say on CO2, that price impact is going to be greater than what you would see if you applied the metric that we gave you at the beginning of the year. And one of the main reasons for that is the deterioration in the NGLs accrued ratio.","So, we had a set NGL to crude ratio in our budget. NGL prices have deteriorated more than crude prices and so that's having, overall on Kinder Morgan, roughly about a $40 million impact versus our budget, most of which comes in the CO2 segment.","On terminals we expect them to end slightly below their budget for the year. You're seeing weakness in steel and coal. There's an FX impact from a weaker Canadian dollar from the translation of earnings from Canada. And then some of those detriments are being slightly offset by higher acquisition -- contributions from acquisitions than what we budgeted.","KMC is going to come in below its budget, primarily as a function of FX. So, overall, segment earnings before DD&A versus our budget, we're expecting the segment earnings to come in in the range of 1.5%, maybe 1.75% below our original budget estimate.","Now, after the segments, dropping down to look at G&A. G&A expense in the quarter was $164 million, that's up $16 million versus a year ago. It's up $22 million year-to-date. Some of that is the result of the Hiland transaction versus our budget.","We expect to come in, for the full year, about 4% over our budget in G&A, and that's primarily a function of two things; one, the G&A as a result that we absorbed in the Hiland transaction, and, two, lower capitalized overhead than what we initially budgeted. And that's primarily because of the lower spending in our CO2 segment.","Interest in the quarter was expense of $527 million, that's about $78 million higher than the second quarter of 2014. That's all balanced. Actually we had a slight savings on rate versus a year ago.","Similar story for the $147 million increase in the six months. It's all a function of balance. Balance in the six months is $7.3 billion higher than it was for the first six months in 2014. And then we also have a slightly lower rate which is giving us a benefit.","For the full year, we expect interest to be flat versus our budget. And what you're seeing there is the interest expense from the Hiland acquisition being offset by lower balances and lower rates on the businesses that existed and the expansion capital that we expected to spend in the budget.","So, dropping down, looking back at our DCF calculation which is net income plus DD&A, et cetera, the segment earnings, the G&A and the interest that I just went through, essentially takes care of the first four lines of that calculation. The next line, cash taxes, which were an expense of $18 million in the quarter.","With that said, $282 million less in expense than the second quarter in 2014, and $288 million on a year-to-date basis. And that's largely a function of the consolidation transaction where we have more depreciation deductions as a result of the step up in the assets and as a result of all of the depreciation staying inside of KMI rather than some of it being allocated to the limited partners.","The next line, other items, is primarily a function of the coverage that was at the MLPs. You can see that the largest number in that column relates to 2014. So, when I think about it I really net that number with the $669 million of distributions that we made in 2014. Neither of those items impacts 2015, so you have a big change there.","Sustaining capital was $141 million of expense in the second quarter and that's up about $13 million versus the second quarter last year. It's up about $36 million on a year-to-date basis, but its positive year-to-date versus our budget. But that's primarily timing.","For the full year, we're expecting sustaining CapEx to come in above our budget, largely as a result of the Hiland acquisition and also as a result of a relocation that we have on one of our natural gas pipelines.","The variance on sustaining CapEx for the year should largely be offset by a positive variance on cash taxes. So, the two of those should come pretty close to netting for the full year.","Looking at the certain items in the quarter, the certain items were $23 million in the quarter. A number of those we explained to you in past quarters because they're recurring on a quarterly basis.","The one that I will highlight for you is the gain\/loss disposition impairments of $50 million. That's primarily we made a decision to sell an asset or some pipe [ph] in our Copano, Oklahoma operation and there was a -- it was the right economic decision.","There was a loss on that transaction and a lot of that has to do with purchase price allocation and doing it -- that purchase price allocation at a very high level as opposed to going down and looking at the income on every little section of pipe.","So, that is -- for the full year, on coverage, we expect to end the year with over $400 million in coverage. Now, if you utilize the metric we gave you at the beginning of the year, the $10 million change in DCF for every $1 change in crude oil price, plus the $3 million in DCF for every $0.10 change in gas, plus about in the range of $40 million impact for deterioration in the NGL ratio, you get pretty close to where we expect to be on a full year basis.","But that probably over simplifies the situation because there are lots of other moving parts. Now, all these other moving parts essentially net out, but let me just take you through some of those so you're aware of what's going on.","The other buckets, we've got other commodity price impacts which relate to -- outside of the metrics, a lot of which relates to lower CO2 volumes and lower midstream volumes as the result of a lower commodity price environment also, lower revenues because of different contract mix on our CO2 sales. We've got the impact from FX on the weaker Canadian dollar. We've got lower capitalized overhead primarily as a result of the $450 million in lower spending on CO2.","And then these impacts are being offset by the accretion coming from the Hiland transaction, interest savings, and CO2 cost savings. So, again, we expect to end the year with over $400 million in coverage.","And while we expect that to happen and obviously and that's positive coverage for the year, we may have negative coverage in the third quarter. We told you we thought in the second quarter we might have it in the second quarter. You can see we ended up on the good side of that equation. We're slightly positive.","And the third quarter will be tight, as well. And as we tell you every year, we expect very strong coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and generally the second and third quarters are weak.","So, with that I'm going to turn to the balance sheet. Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $42.6 billion in debt. That results in a debt to EBITDA ratio of 5.8 times. That's higher than the budget primarily due to the Hiland acquisition. We've got four and a half months for the earnings, but we've got all the debt. We still expect consistent with our budget to end the year at 5.6 times.","The change in debt for the quarter was a reduction in debt of $200 million. Year-to-date we've had an increase in debt of $2 billion. And just to run through some of the largest pieces of that, for the quarter we spent about 900 -- a little over $950 million on acquisitions, expansions and contributions to equity investments, with the expansion CapEx being the biggest piece of that.","We issued equity of and received cash for the equity that we issued of $936 million. We had coverage of $20 million, as I told you previously. And then there are working capital and other items that were a source of cash of about $191 million, the biggest piece of that being accrued interest and AP and AR, which was somewhat offset by some legal settlements, some rate refunds on EP&G that we had already reserved for the primary offsets to that.","For the year a $2 billion increase in debt. We've spent over $5 billion on acquisitions, expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. Acquisitions were $3.3 billion. The largest acquisitions were the Hiland acquisition for $3.1 billion, and the Vopak acquisition of $158 million, both of which happened in the first quarter.","We issued equity of a little bit under $2.6 billion. We got an income tax refund for $200 million, we had coverage of $226 million, and then we had working capital and other items of about $16 million.","So, with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich for the Q&A.","Rich Kinder","Good. We'll take any questions you might have. Jeremy, if you'll come back on we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Our first question is from Christine Cho from Barclays. Your line is open.","Christine Cho","Good afternoon.","Rich Kinder","Hi Christine. How are you?","Christine Cho","Good. How are you?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Christine Cho","So, we've had some M&A attempts and announcements in recent weeks, one of which was an unsolicited bid. With talks about bid-ask being too wide and maybe some companies not even thinking about putting themselves up for sale, would an unsolicited bid and maybe even going public with such an offer if any potential targets said no be something on the table for you guys?","Just asking because you guys did make an unsolicited bid for El Paso on the heels of the KMI IPO back several years ago. So, there is some history there but wondering if anything has changed on your side or if you even think anything out there is worth the trouble.","Steve Kean","Christine, that's just so hard to project into in advance. All acquisitions are very circumstance-specific. And we wouldn't sit here and categorically say -- clearly, and even in the El Paso case, we've done deals on an agreed to or negotiated basis, we would never say categorically that we wouldn't do it any other way. But it's just too circumstance-specific for us to give you a definitive answer on that. Dax, do you have anything you want to add to that?","Dax Sanders","No, I think it's something that - I would agree with your summary that bid offer spreads still do sort of exist in a lot of places. Obviously you've seen certain situations where there's been some movement and some deals getting done. And I think our thought is that -- at least my thought is that you'll probably see a little bit more activity in the second half this year than you've seen in a while. But I think Steve's point about not speculating on any tactic or certain situation is exactly the way we thought about it.","Christine Cho","Okay, great. And then I thought I saw that Gulf LNG filed the FERC application last month. It's been fairly quiet with news on that front so was just curious what you were seeing on the customer contract side.","Also, was the filing more of a check the box to have the regulatory side of things not be the bottleneck or was it something customers wanted to see you do before talking more seriously given the time it takes to receive approval?","Steve Kean","You're right. We did that -- we filed on June 19th, I believe. And it is us continuing to advance that project. We continue to talk to customers about it. It is the last brownfield site that hasn't been put under contract. We think it is a promising location and in the long-term we're very bullish on U.S. LNG and where it fits.","Clearly there's a pause that's been hit and there's a debate about how long that pause runs, what the real capacities are out there, and for how long the market might be somewhat oversupplied. But we think this is a good project and we're looking at it in a timeframe that's early the next decade.","So, I think it fits well with what the market recovery might ultimately be shaped into. But, Christine, as you know, we don't have it in the backlog. We're working the customer piece of it, having active discussions, but nothing we can really report to you that's anywhere near definitive at this point.","Christine Cho","Great. And then the last one for me, can you talk about the steps leading to Shell's decision to sell its equity interest of the Elba JV? Did you approach them; did they approach you, et cetera? Any color would be helpful.","Steve Kean","Yes, we've been working together for a long time in developing this project. Costs have been increasing on it and scope has been adjusted. I'm not going to speak for Shell at all, but you don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that they bought BG, that the market outlook on LNG has changed a bit.","They wanted to restructure the contract. We were certainly willing to restructure it on the terms that we got here and invest additional capital, $2.1 billion in total now, on the project at the return that we're getting for it.","We got a different risk allocation. Shell is retaining certain risks. We are picking up certain risks, but the risks that we are comfortable dealing with in today's market environment for materials and construction services and the like. So, we think we can do this project and do it successfully.","The added benefit, from our standpoint, as I think I mentioned, is that we get control now. This is not a two-headed thing anymore. We've got control over this project and its development and construction, and we'll get it built. And we're happy to have Shell as the customer on the facility and we're very happy to be in charge.","Rich Kinder","And we're happy to put more money into this project at returns that we think are very good, particularly given Shell credit for a 20-year contract.","Operator","And the next question is from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","How are you doing?","Shneur Gershuni","Good. How are you?","Rich Kinder","Fine.","Shneur Gershuni","Just a couple quick questions. Steve, in your prepared remarks, you sort of talked about how much the backlog has actually grown. And some of it is the acquisition; some of it is projects that you've been talking about for some time.","I was wondering if you can give us is some color. We're nine months into the commodity collapse. The E&P budgets from a CapEx perspective have been coming down for the last six months. How are the discussions about incremental ideas, concepts, logistics projects going at this point right now? Are things slowing down? Are some opportunities cropping up?","I was wondering if you can give us some insight as to how you think the backlog would grow over the next 12 months beyond the projects that you're hoping to add to the backlog at this stage right now.","Steve Kean","Okay. Well look first, broadly, clearly what affects our customers affects us. And so the backlog probably would have been growing even faster than it did in a different commodity price environment and it also affects a little bit who we're talking to.","As I said before, we had seen a lot of producer push projects on the gas side. In particular, we started to see more market pull. Now, it's interesting, this time that 1.4 BCF of sign up is almost evenly divided -- almost, not quite -- across LDCs, producers and LNG. And so that's a little bit of a counter, I think, to what we have been seeing.","But what affects our customers affects us. But we think it's a very positive sign that in this commodity price environment we're growing the backlog where we are. And like I said, we came up to the brink on even more additions which I think we'll still get a good chunk of and grow it from here.","So, I think, just broadly, there are many moving pieces and many markets that we're serving and addressing and you have to kind of look at them individually to see where the opportunities are. We're still early stages of the really big demand pull.","Beginning of next year we start to see LNG pull. We are seeing this year power demand pull. That 9% sales volume increase on the intrastates was really quite remarkable, I think, and shows you what we're seeing on industrial and power demand in the state of Texas. So things are -- and the 1.4 BCF of contract sign ups.","Those things are showing you that even in a down market; our network is well-positioned for the places where there is growth. And so we still feel pretty good about our prospects and our ability to grow this backlog from where we are.","You look out over the next 12 months, again very hard to say, but we've made a lot of progress on NED supply. We hope to get that in the corral, but it's not there yet. And we're working on UMTP. That's been a multi-year saga at this point.","Gulf LNG we'll continue to work and I think we continue to see operations that are opportunities in John's business on the liquids terminals side. As I mentioned, a lot going on in the Houston ship channel that we're actively developing. We started to see -- again not in the backlog, but on new build chemical facilities some interest in the chemical companies having their midstream infrastructure done by a midstream company as opposed to making it part of their project.","So, those are all things that I think are positive indicators, notwithstanding the fact that you've got a down market and it's dragging down G&P investment, for example, on the negative side. So, we still feel pretty good about it and feel like we've got a good chance of continuing to add to the backlog even as we're rolling stuff in.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Just as a follow-up question I was wondering if we can talk about the balance sheet for a second, a two-part question. I understand your expectation to get to 5.6 times by the end of this year. Is the commitment to the rating agencies to get it to this year or is it during 2016?","And then I was wondering if you can also talk about the warrant repurchase program. It seems counterintuitive to be buying back one side of the capital structure while issuing equity on the other. Just wondering if you can talk in context of the overall plan to de-lever.","Steve Kean","Kim?","Kim Dang","On the commitments of the rating agencies, this was in all of the materials at the time we did Project Fusion which was we were going to start out of the box at 5.6 times. We were going to remain elevated for a couple of years and that when the larger projects, Trans Mountain and Elba came on, that was the biggest driver of deleveraging over that period.","So, that is still our expectation. And getting to 5.6 times at the end of the year is consistent with that, consistent with what we showed the rating agencies at the time of the transaction and consistent with what we budgeted and they saw in our projects when we published that in January.","On the warrant repurchase, that is just when there are disconnects between where the shares are pricing and where the warrants are pricing. We think that there may be opportunities to buy those warrants. We evaluate that from time-to-time and when we see those opportunities then we'll execute on the warrant repurchase.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","And the next question is from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey John, how are you doing?","John Edwards","Doing well. Good afternoon. Just a question for Steve. So, on Northeast Direct you indicated you've moved two-thirds of it now to the backlog. But if memory serves, the amount of commitments you've secured are about the same as it was last quarter. So, help me understand better what change that you're able to move that to backlog and you're in position to move forward with it.","Steve Kean","Yeah, that's right, John, and it's really three things. One is those contracts; we've developed greater confidence around them as they're starting through their LDC approval process.","Secondly, we looked hard at the project and as we were phasing the capacity in, sort of where would we have unsold capacity and what do we think we could do with that capacity, what value could we attribute to it.","That's not under contract, that's based on our judgment that, because the demand is there and it's growing that we're going to be able to market some of that unsold capacity. We'll still be trying to actively sell it, of course, long-term, but we'll have good economic opportunities on some of the unsold capacity, particularly during the wintertime. So, we put that into our expectations.","And then, finally, just the overwhelming need for the project overall, the demand. And frankly we think that getting out there with our customers, telling them that we're going forward is going to help in the additional sign ups that we need.","It helps us get through the approval process, it helps us make the project concrete for the people who we want to get concrete with us in terms of signing up for long-term commitments. So, those are the things that improved our confidence quarter-over-quarter.","John Edwards","Okay. And then how did you factor in one of the major competing projects there into this calculus?","Steve Kean","Okay, we have our eyes on our own homework here, basically. We're trying to fill this thing up with commitments. And whether the other guys get theirs done or not, we're tunnel vision on this. We're just focusing on our deals and getting those in.","We think we have a very good project and that that project is properly located in size to serve New England markets and to attract our share, if you want to call it that, but certainly the most accessible power demand to that footprint.","And so we have no commentary here at all on what that means about the other guy's project. We're fighting for this like it's a one-project deal and we'll continue to do so.","John Edwards","Okay, that's helpful. And just on the backlog, you did increase substantially and congrats on that. I guess did it move? How was that relative to your expectations? I mean higher or lower I guess if you can give any color on that?","Steve Kean","It depends on the time frame that you would look at it from. If you'd asked at the end of last quarter, it's higher than I would have expected. If you'd asked me last week it's lower. We're not going to do anything uneconomic just to put something in the backlog. We're negotiating on a couple of other things and we think we'll get them done. And if and when we do we'll get them out there. But I personally am pleased with the addition for this quarter. I think this is very strong, particularly when you look at the overall market out there.","John Edwards","So, then, if you can talk a little bit about -- so relative to the overall market, given the pretty sloppy commodity conditions that we're in, you'd indicated you thought if commodity prices were a lot higher, that obviously you thought the backlog would be a lot higher. And so just -- I'm trying to get a sense for how -- what the opportunity set more broadly is looking like from your perspective, if you can give any commentary on that front.","Rich Kinder","Let me jump in there, John. The truth of it is that we're damned pleased with having a $22 billion backlog in this kind of environment, number one. Number two, we have a heck of a lot more opportunities out there and it's a reflection of the fact that we have just a very good footprint spanning North America. And so, we're going to continue to look at this.","Steve is absolutely right. We have some more opportunities that are pretty close to getting the horse in the corral. We hope to get it in and put the saddle on shortly and when we do we'll advise you of it. And we've got a lot of other potential here.","But we're doing really well on the backlog. And I think to predict exactly where we are going to be in one quarter or two quarters is a fool's errand. But we're very pleased with where we are and what we have out in front of us.","John Edwards","That's actually really helpful. I'm just trying to get a sense for maybe more broadly the industry conditions. But that's very helpful. That's all I had for now, but thank you very much.","Steve Kean","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey Darren, how are you?","Darren Horowitz","Hey, fine. Thanks Rich, I hope you and everyone are doing well. Just one question for me on UMTP. I realize you're involved in the open season until September, so, Steve, as you said, the saga continues.","But with respect to all the recently proposed acquisitions and volatility across all of the NGL dynamics, including price expectations in the Northeast, how do you guys think about Northeast NGL supply\/demand balance? How do you think it could change?","And, more importantly, to what extent does that influence your thoughts either on scale or scope of the project or maybe even downstream market demand for batched NGL service on UMTP?","Steve Kean","Okay, yeah, so a few things there. I mean one is, again, lower commodity prices do dampen the enthusiasm for making longer term commitments by the producers. But having said that, the long-term outlook, we think, for NGL production out of that region is very robust.","And there are producers who are focused on that and realize that for their netbacks to be attractive they need to have an outlet and they probably need to have multiple outlets or have options.","And we think having the option to access essentially the capital of the U.S. NGL market in Mont Belvieu, as well as the heart of petchem demand along the Gulf Coast here, as well as access to export docks, that's pretty attractive. And so, the people who are thinking about it longer term are going to be attracted to it.","But there were a couple of modifications that we made to help improve our chances. You alluded to one of them, the batch system that makes us really not a competitor with the local fractionators.","We can still move Y grade, that's one of the options. But we can move purity products. And just having the ability to batch different products adds options and therefore adds value to the outlook for producers associated with the project.","The second thing is, quite frankly, we started working on the market side of this. And Ron McClain and his team have been talking to international off-takers who have a different timeframe and perspective that they bring to the table.","And so, we're branching out, outside of just the traditional producing community and trying to find a way to cobble this together by focusing on the demand side, as well, with the market end of it as well.","So, we continue to believe we have a good project. We've been here before. This is not our first open season. So, we're not putting in the backlog, we're not promising success here. But it's also not costing us a lot to maintain this option.","We have the ability, as we've said before, to keep it in gas service and make it part of an additional southbound haul. So, we're going to keep working on it because we believe in it and we're going to keep trying to make it better and get people to sign up for long-term commitments.","Darren Horowitz","Thanks, Steve.","Rich Kinder","I'll add, there's been a lot of preliminary interest in the open season, a lot of people have signed CAs. And so, [Technical Difficulty] interest is there and a lot of that is triggered by the [Technical Difficulty] and the multiple destination and origin point.","Operator","And the next question is from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey Brandon, how are you?","Brandon Blossman","I am good. How are you doing?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Brandon Blossman","This will be a short one but I wanted to tag on the back of Darren's question on EMTT. Is this part of the natural progression, the open season, or was there a catalyst in quarter that kind of shifted the balance to get you guys to go ahead and do an open season? In particular I'm wondering if the spread on a percent realization of NGLs to crude helped spark interest on an end-market perspective.","Steve Kean","No, not really any, call it, short-term spread difference. It was really, the progression here was Ron's team reconceived the project a bit in terms of the batch system and then spent a lot of time on the international, or on the demand side, let's call it, and developed that a bit and then we spent some more time with producers.","And so, it was just the natural next step after having been out there socializing with everybody what the new configuration looked like and trying to figure out the right destinations and the right receipt points. It was just a natural next step.","We often go out in open seasons with an anchor shipper and a pretty high probability, pretty high confidence level of success. I wouldn't call this open season one of those. We are out there in the marketing effort right now. We're going to see if we can get it done. It's not a seeded or anchored open season the way some of ours are.","Brandon Blossman","Great, perfect color on that. Almost 1.5 [ph] of incremental term gas capacity signed up in the quarter. I'd call that impressive. As you look forward, is that going to be a high watermark for the next few quarters or is there something in the hopper, so to speak, that looks equally as good?","Steve Kean","Tom, do you want to comment on that?","Tom Martin","It's a big quarter, but I think we'll do more before the end of the year, I think. That would be probably another B out into the year, if possible.","Brandon Blossman","Okay, that works for me. I think that's it for right now. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And the next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Jeremy.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi, good afternoon. I want to go back to the topic of M&A for a minute, if you could. Just wondering if you could comment at all, in the market out there, if you see producers with midstream assets versus entry level consolidation. It looked more attractive on either side of that. And also how much are you guys looking outside of the U.S. at this point, in Canada or other jurisdictions? Do you see opportunities there, as well?","Steve Kean","Dax?","Dax Sanders","Yeah, I would say that there is certainly some producers out there with assets. I would say that there probably is not necessarily the catalyst right now in certain of those producers that may have existed with certain people earlier this year. But there is certainly some producers that have assets.","The earlier conversation, I think there still certain bid-offer spreads between what those producers' expectations for those assets are, whether it's valuation or control, those types of things, and what people are willing to pay. But you are seeing certain of those deals getting done. I think you may see a few more here and there, but those are still available.","With respect to international assets, I think what we've said in the past; certainly the consolidation we did last year, as we said repeatedly, makes it easier, or drops down some barriers for us to deploy capital internationally. Now, I would say that we have -- so, it's certainly easier for us to do that it has been in the past.","We certainly don't have a mandate to deploy capital internationally, but I think there are -- probably there are fewer barriers and we're probably more open to it than we have been in the past.","But we're certainly cognizant [indiscernible] it would have to present some really good risk-adjusted returns for us to do it. And Western Canada is obviously a place where we have quite a bit of infrastructure and we have a very high [Technical Difficulty].","Jeremy Tonet","And just to add-on a little bit more there, in Mexico there's a lot of activity there. I don't -- I mean there's a lot of infrastructure going up to the border. But just wondering as far as your appetite of moving into Mexico and if that would be something of interest to you.","Rich Kinder","We'll look at all opportunities. It depends on the return-risk ratio. But, again, the point you're making is important. No matter who builds the lines in Mexico, we stand to benefit from them because we have a structure just across the border, whether in Texas or Arizona or in Southern California. So, I think we benefit, but we would not rule out doing something there, but it would have to be under the right terms and conditions.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thanks. And then just one more -- commodity prices have been volatile and have recently shown weakness. And I'm just wondering if you could share any thoughts that you guys have internally on where prices might go and, more importantly, just refresh us on your hedging philosophy.","Steve Kean","You want to add our view to your collection, is that it? First of all, we have maintained discipline around our hedging policy even when you don't necessarily like the prices you're seeing. Jesse and his team have continued to layer on the hedges even in this commodity price environment.","I think there's a lot of near-term bearishness, certainly in across -- particularly across the liquids parts of the commodity portfolio. But I think longer term; the future is brighter for those as we see additional demand of pick up.","But, look, it's so hard to call. Particularly oil has all of the geopolitical factors that you'd have to have a crystal ball to try to predict. But I think fundamentally you would believe there to be long-term upside in those commodity prices, but maybe not this year.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. So, no changing to your hedging policy. You guys are still active in future years?","Steve Kean","That's correct.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And the next question is from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, Craig.","Craig Shere","Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering what was driving or the thinking was in this commodity environment where there was maybe another $1 million, if I heard correctly, in additional EOR CapEx that hit the pipeline. And I was also curious if some more color could be given on some of the smaller fields that this quarter, those still behind budgets, seem to be picking up a little.","Steve Kean","Okay. On the EOR front, I mean Jesse can fill in here. But what we have done is we've added some additional investment, which is really part of the program that we had anticipated all along on our tall cotton or residual oil zone recovery. That's the bulk of what we're adding to the backlog.","We did an assessment of this, really, last quarter to look at what are the returns in the current commodity price environment and really looking at it at $50, $60, $40 and $70 range.","And between $50 and $60, these projects are very attractive returns, and even better when you take into account even a modest assumption around cost reductions of say 15%. Jesse and his team are doing better than that right now. So, these projects are economic and we will pursue them so long as they are. And I'm sorry the second part of your question Craig was?","Kim Dang","Production attachment [ph] and--","Steve Kean","And what about it.","Craig Shere","Goldsmith seemed to be picking up a little more. I know Katz and Goldsmith are behind but it seems like they may be perking up a little bit, and if there's any update that you could give. ","Rich Kinder","I'm going to ask Jesse who heads up our CO2 operation. We're very pleased; Goldsmith was up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, Jesse, do you want to comment on that?","Jesse Arenivas","Yeah, I think we've seen a lot of improvement with Goldsmith, primarily on our implementation with surveillance and facility optimization projects able to withdraw more fluid which was a hold back on production.","I think we're currently averaging about 1,900 barrels a day, which is almost double what we had this time last year. So, we've seen a lot of improvement. Well operating costs are coming down. We're finding more efficient methods to move fluid. But, overall, we're pleased and we've come a long way in the quarter.","Craig Shere","Great. And a bit of a follow-up, maybe, to Christine's question on industry M&A. I know that historically you normally don't pursue aggressive M&A, either in terms of paying a lot or hostile. But if large peers are putting themselves up, do you see absolute regulatory issues barring you from participating?","Or is that something that you can at least sharpen the pencil on to determine if maybe some individual large assets are better placed somewhere else, but you can still participate in that process?","Rich Kinder","That would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis, looking at the exact assets involved and whether there is or isn't overlap with our footprint. But we would never rule anything out and certainly think we would study very carefully anything that came to fruition.","Craig Shere","And last question, Rich, you said that there were attractive returns given the 20-year guarantee by Shell on that $630 million of additional investment. Is there roughly a broad range of EBITDA in that project you could offer at Elba?","Steve Kean","I don't have an EBITDA number off the top of my head. I think--","Kim Dang","But it's consistent with how we would price other projects with a long-term credit from an A rated credit.","Craig Shere","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Peter Levinson of Waveny Capital. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey Peter.","Peter Levinson","Hey guys, how are you?","Rich Kinder","Fine.","Peter Levinson","A question for Rich and Steve. It seems to us that in the last, call it, six to eight weeks your stock has been beaten up for four reasons. One, rates, fear of rate hikes in the Fed, et cetera. If we spot that the Fed is going to start to raise rates gradually it still doesn't seem to explain the move in your stock because you're trading at historical wides, and you're trading much wide to your comps than you have historically.","Two, crude being down, Iran coming online, OPEC, et cetera. But you have given us the math; you've demonstrated you're not meaningfully exposed to the crude price. Three, the timely or untimely resurrection of what I thought was a wholly discredited bear attack by a tabloid claiming that your investment grade debt is not serviceable.","And, four, your retirement. But you're showing us that you remain actively involved. You've been buying stock in the open market, you're leading this call. I'm struggling to understand. Until, call it, two weeks ago you and Williams traded exactly in line on a dividend yield basis. They got a bid at a 33% premium. Your stock trades down. What am I missing?","Rich Kinder","You tell me. It goes without saying, you guys listen to me, I'm the largest shareholder and I don't like it a bit. What's the old saying? I'm mad as hell and I won't take it anymore. But I can't use the latter part of that, obviously.","No, I think in the long run markets are rational. In the short-term they can be irrational. If you look at it, we've looked at it every way from Sunday. Through the first quarter, we outperformed most of our peers. We fell off the second quarter. And if you look at it back through October when oil was last at $90, we've done pretty well compared with the peers.","We're very disappointed with the performance over the last few weeks. Some of us have bought more stock. That's the only good thing, it's a buying opportunity. And we just don't see it. All the points you make are interesting. Certainly I don't think my retirement has anything to do with this. I'm still around; my name is on the door. Steve and Kim and the rest of this team can run it a hell of a lot better than I can, anyway. So, that should not be and is not in my opinion, a factor.","But certainly rates are. Any time you have bear attacks I suppose that has some modest impact. But I am hopeful that after what we've said today and you can see this growth in the backlog and the fact that I'll never say, as Steve said, that we're unaffected, as he said. Sure, we have effect against us if our customers are suffering with low commodity prices.","But in general, we're pretty oblivious to this. We're pretty able to profit and produce very nice cash flow regardless of where the commodity prices are. And to me, that's what makes this a great story.","When you're out there saying we're paying a 5% dividend and giving you 10% growth for the next six years that to me is just a wonderful story based on $130 billion of enterprise value. So, we're very disappointed in the price, so thank you for giving me the opportunity to comment on it.","Peter Levinson","Okay. Thanks very much, and congrats on a great quarter.","Operator","And the next question is from Becca Followill of U.S. Capital. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Becca, how are you?","Becca Followill","I'm good. Thanks. On the $600 million project that you're deferring into, can you talk about what that is?","Steve Kean","Yeah, it's primarily -- it's not exclusively, but primarily it is additional CO2 source development. And it's really two things. One is that part of the source development that we're continuing with at Doe Canyon we found a much more economic way to get the same amount of production essentially involved. We didn't have to build a whole new set of facilities. We can use an existing set of facilities to accomplish what we want out there, so we were able to take scope out of the project.","But the rest of it and the majority of it, really, is that we think we can scale back the addition of additional CO2 source and still meet the demand that we expect for the market for the near-term so, during the period of the backlog. So, we still see growth in that CO2 demand, just not as much as it was before. Jesse, anything else?","Becca Followill","So, none of it is reduced drilling or infield development?","Steve Kean","It's not reduced. We're drilling on both ends of this thing. So, the EOR, it's not a representation of reduced activity in the enhanced oil recovery fields. It's on the development of CO2 production that we send down the pipe and send to third-parties and our operations.","Becca Followill","Okay. Thank you. And then just to clarify Elba liquefaction, I think just based on your analyst meeting the original CapEx there was $884 million for your 51%. And then you're seeing additional $630 million, yet there's a total of $2.1 billion. Can you help me reconcile that difference?","Rich Kinder","I think the $885 million just pertained to our share of the plant itself. And we have other ancillary facilities that we are building as part of this and we're getting paid for.","Steve Kean","So, think of Elba as two pieces with a third related piece. One is the liquefaction facility self. That was the JV; that was the 51\/49 JV. The other is the Elba terminal facilities itself, which were always 100% Kinder Morgan.","And then the third related pieces, the transportation, the upstream gas pipeline transportation that brings the gas into the facility, some of which is being done for Shell but some is being done for third parties, as well, and that's 100% Kinder Morgan.","Becca Followill","Okay, great. And then to clarify on the product pipeline, did you restate you're showing volumes there?","Kim Dang","We adjust for the JV. We may, yes, Becca, we would have adjusted both periods. There were some cases where we were showing JVs at 100%. So, we've gone to our pro rata share on those JVs. And it's an apples-to-apples comparison meaning we adjusted the prior period and this period.","Becca Followill","Okay, got you. And then do you have a new estimate of CapEx excluding acquisitions for 2015? The original was $4.4 billion. There's been new productions in CO2 plus additions there. Is that $4.4 billion still ballpark or are we looking at lower than that? ","Kim Dang","We're looking at lower. So, the original $4.4 billion included a little over $300 million in acquisitions. So, the $4.4 billion is now $7 billion again, including acquisitions of Hiland and stuff. So, on the original budget it was $4.0 billion, really, or $4.04 billion of expansion CapEx. And that number is now $3.6 billion of the $7 billion is associated with expansion CapEx.","So, about a $430 million reduction. And that -- it's got a lot of moving parts in it, but the biggest piece is roughly the $450 million reduction that I talked about in CO2, primarily associated with the S&P development at St. John's and the Lobos 5.","Becca Followill","Okay, perfect. And then last question on Northeast Direct, with capacity of 1.3 BCF a day, contracted 550, I know you said you're comfortable; it's picking up volumes, maybe, especially in the winter. But how do you phase this in? If you don't get any additional contracts do you go forward with the full 1.3 assuming it's only 42% contracted? Or do you -- how do you phase it in so that you can maybe not be so under contracted?","Steve Kean","Yeah, good question. If we get the pipe laid, the compression additions can be separate decisions. And so, when I talk about us being able to phase in as the commitments come in, we're going to ask to authorize the whole thing, but we will be able to make decisions on individual compression capacity additions as the commitments come through.","Jesse Arenivas","Yes, to just repeat what Steve and Rich said earlier, we're really kicking off the project for 600,000 a day. But certainly with the compression expansions we can scale it up as we get additional firm commitments, up to the 1.3, and that won't affect the original timing of serving of original customers because they are just compression expansions. ","Becca Followill","Thank you. That helps a lot. And then, finally, on EMTP, with no storage, or underground storage, up in the area, is that a big chunk of the $4 billion price tag -- having to build above ground storage to run the system?","Steve Kean","We do have some storage additions included in the project. Ron, do you want to cover that?","Ron McClain","We have some storage on the north end plan and we're looking at storage options on the south end. I don't believe they're included. That gets back to where the shipper wants to go with products, whether it's chem for refining or international.","I think a big part of the issue potential on the south end. We do have some plans. To coordinate you have to buffer your product in a batch line. So, some products come in, others are building inventory and eventually will clear in so that there's operational [Technical Difficulty].","Becca Followill","Thank you. And then, I'm sorry, I had one more. On Palmetto, how do you guys proceed without having that permit from Georgia?","Steve Kean","As I said, the permit is not required for us to proceed with the project. It would have been helpful to the project. And I don't want to go into a lot of detail here. We're really exploring the options for how we nevertheless proceed with the project, but don't want to go into a lot of detail here for competitive reasons.","Becca Followill","Understand. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And the next question is from Ross Payne from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Mr. Payne, how are you doing?","Ross Payne","I'm doing fine Rich. How are you doing?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Ross Payne","A follow on question to that. I assume the Palmetto was going to bring additional volumes for Elba Island to export, so I was going to ask--.","Rich Kinder","No, it's not.","Ross Payne","Okay.","Steve Kean","Yes, different product. Palmetto is gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. And of course we're talking about LNG.","Ross Payne","Okay, my bad on that. With the Georgia situation, I guess you've given about as much information as you can, but in terms of your confidence level on being able to move forward with that, how would you gauge that?","Steve Kean","We're still confident enough to leave it in the backlog -- it was already in the backlog -- which is a reflection that we believe that it's a highly probable project.","Ross Payne","Okay. And then if you guys could give us a little bit of an update on where you are in your hedges for the rest of the year and then maybe looking into 2016 in terms of percentage of expected production that you're hedged and perhaps the level.","Kim Dang","Yeah, on 2015 -- the balance of 2015 we're hedged at 81% at $78. In 2016, we're hedged at 58% at $75; 2017 at 36% at $75; 2018 is 27% at $75; and 2019 is 12% at $66.","Ross Payne","Okay. Thank you, Kim, very much. And then one of the rating agencies recently wrote you guys up and kind of inferred that there could be some M&A that's outside of your typical business. If you guys can talk about what that might look like and just expand on that a little bit if you can.","Steve Kean","Not sure what you're referring to there, Ross. Do you have something more specific on it? Or David, do you have an answer on it?","David Michels","Yes, I think he's referring to -- Ross, I think you're referring to the Moody's write-up where they talk about the potential need to reach outside of our typical traditional skills of investments. And I think he referenced the Jones Act tankers, which we are very happy with that acquisition and are supported by long-term contracts.","Ross Payne","Right. I just didn't know if there was going to be anything beyond that box that we've typically seen with you guys. And obviously Jones Act pushed it out a little bit but you could almost call that a moving pipeline. Do you guys envision getting into any other assets outside of the typical energy assets?","Rich Kinder","Look, Ross, as we've said many times, we look at our self as a toll road, and that toll road is a pipeline which is certainly our field of greatest expertise and where the majority of our assets are. That's great. If it moves by rail, we're pretty big in rail terminals. If it moves by ship, we have Jones Act tankers.","We look at all these things that we can do as long as it's in the energy field and as long as we're acting as a toll road and could lock up as much of the cash flow as humanly possible. And that's why these Jones Act tankers have been so good. We've been able to enter into long-term contracts with very creditworthy shippers.","So, we'll continue to look for opportunities like that. We're not going to go out and buy a bakery -- although I'm glad Hostess cupcakes are doing so well. We're sticking to what we know.","Ross Payne","Great. All right. That's what I wanted to hear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And the next question is from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","HI Faisel, how are you?","Faisel Khan","Good. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. Just a couple questions. Going back to somebody else's question on the product pipelines, the throughput volumes there, I just want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly.","It looks like gasoline volumes sequentially dropped off pretty significantly, although they were up year-over-year. I just want to make sure I understand how those numbers move around. Obviously profits were up sequentially and up over last year. But I just want to make sure I understand how the seasonality works on the product pipelines. ","Rich Kinder","I guess I'm a little confused on that. Our total refined products were 159 million barrels -- really 160 million barrels this time versus 304 year-to-date, which would mean it's actually up second quarter over first quarter, just eyeballing it.","Faisel Khan","Okay, sorry, I must be looking at different data then. I'm looking at 110 million barrels in the first quarter down to 98 million barrels, so I must be pulling different data then. That's fine.","Rich Kinder","We're up 4% overall on the refined product. A lot of that is on the West Coast and Pacific. We think lower commodity prices drives more demand. And there's also some recovery of economy. So, we're really enjoying that on both coasts.","Faisel Khan","Okay. So, the volumes are definitely up sequentially on the product pipelines.","Steve Kean","Yeah. And I'm just looking at the same numbers from the release here. Our three months is more than half of the year-to-date so we're up --.","Faisel Khan","Okay, got you. I'm just reading the data wrong. Sorry about that.","Rich Kinder","But you would expect gasoline demand grows as you go into the summer months.","Faisel Khan","Right, that's what I was trying to look at.","Rich Kinder","If you look around here, and as Ron McClain was pointing out, that these lower prices, if they have any advantage, we are starting to see this as the third or fourth quarter in a row where we have seen improvement quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So, that's encouraging. But it looks like maybe lower prices are having some impact on how much people are driving.","Kim Dang","And if you're looking at last quarter's press release, you might look at just this one and do the comparative data. Plantation may have been adjusted, too, our share of Plantation.","Faisel Khan","Okay. That's what we did -- that's what we have.","Kim Dang","For both periods in this press release. But if you're looking at a prior one it might have that issue.","Faisel Khan","Okay. So, we must be getting it wrong. Okay, thank you for clearing that up.","Unidentified Company Speaker","[Technical Difficulty] 282% quarter-over-quarter. A lot of that is because of acquisition and tremendous growth [Technical Difficulty].","Faisel Khan","Okay, understood. And just a couple questions on potential enhancements or expansions of your current asset base. Is there a way for you to make a significant investment in the LPG export end market given the terminals you guys control around the country? How are you looking at that opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis the demand from customers?","Steve Kean","Yea, we're looking at -- we have a great position on the Houston ship channel, a number of facilities, as you know, up and down the channel. And we have been looking at opportunities for export facilities. We don't have anything done yet. Go ahead John.","John Schlosser","There are a number of opportunities present themselves. We're looking at LPG, both in Houston and the Northeast. But it's competing with clean product projects that we're looking at the same facilities as well as potential crude projects. So, the market is very ripe in Houston right now, it's just a matter of which products makes the most sense on a going forward basis.","Faisel Khan","Okay, understood. And if you think about those different options what's the more profitable barrel to ship? Is it gasoline and diesel or is it LPG?","John Schlosser","Our experience on the Houston ship channel is 43 million barrels of gasoline and diesel. And we have had a tremendous amount of success on that and we have a number of projects to continue to grow and expand that. We've gone from four docks to 12 docks. Gasoline and diesel are both seeing resurgence on the export side. So, we'll see more and more opportunities there.","The LPG projects are very profitable so they could compete with potential clean and other expansions. But we see more and more opportunities on the clean side, more so than the other two.","Faisel Khan","Okay. And just going back to a question someone asked about what kind of assets, would you own any other assets outside of the normal footprint you've been in? Would you ever buy a railroad company?","Steve Kean","I think, as Rich said, what we're looking for is secure cash flows and particularly secure and growing cash flows. So, you couldn't say that that was off the table. There may be opportunities like that. But as you know, that's an extremely concentrated industry. We have done well, I think, with our investment in Watco, and that's about, I think, all there is to say on it.","Faisel Khan","Understood. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back over to Mr. Rich Kinder.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you all very much, and have a good evening.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. All parties may now disconnect. Thank you."],"12305":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I\u2019d now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Sharon, and welcome to the investor call. As usual, we\u2019ll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.","I\u2019ll make some introductory remarks, Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer will talk more about operations and our backlog; Kim Dang, our CFO, will review the numbers for the fourth quarter and full-year \u201914; and Dax Sanders, our Vice President, Corporate Development will talk about an acquisition that we just announced this afternoon.","Let me just start by summarizing very briefly that acquisition. We think it\u2019s a very exciting and strategic acquisition that we announced by separate release this afternoon. We are acquiring Hiland Partners, which is a large privately owned midstream company with crude transportation and gathering assets and gas gathering and processing assets, primarily in the Tier 1 sweet spot acreage of the Bakken formation. It\u2019s overwhelmingly fee-based and it gives us the platform for further growth in the Bakken where we currently have no asset.","We think we can do in the Bakken the kind of expansion that we did on our Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate system down here in the Eagle Ford, which has grown from less than 50,000 barrels a day throughput to having virtually all of its 300,000 barrel per day capacity contracted for in future deliveries. So think of what we\u2019re doing as building a spider web that we intend to expand over the coming months and years.","The consideration for the purchase is $3 billion, including approximately $1 billion of assumed debt. We have a bridge loan commitment to finance the remainder. And longer term we will finance that remainder with equity and debt to maintain our appropriate level of debt to EBITDA ratio previously communicated to both the rating agencies and to our equity investors.","The transaction will be modestly accretive to DCF per share in \u201915 and \u201916, with the accretion ramping up thereafter and is supported by long-term contracts with the systems largest shipper. That\u2019s an overview and Dax will give you more details in just a few minutes.","Now let me get back to \u201914 and the outlook for \u201915. As you know, we closed the merger of all the Kinder Morgan entities into KMI during the fourth quarter. And so that made for somewhat of a noisy quarter post closing, but bottom line our DCF per share for the quarter was $0.60 and we\u2019ve declared a dividend of $0.45. That leaves excess coverage for the quarter of $320 million.","Looking at the $0.45 dividend, that\u2019s a 10% increase to the fourth quarter of \u201913. It means that we will have distributed dividends for the full-year \u201914 of $1.74 per share versus $1.60 in \u201913 and $1.72 in our plan. Now we were negatively impacted to a certain extend in the quarter by lower commodity prices primarily in our CO2 segment, but we were still able to produce strong results and in my judgment that shows that our toll road like assets perform well, even when prices for underlying commodities are extremely volatile.","Now looking to the future, we said when we announced the merger of all the Kinder Morgan entities back in August of \u201914 that we expected to be able to declare a dividend of $2 for our calendar year \u201915. To grow that dividend at a compound annual rate of 10% out through 2020, and have more than $2 billion of excess coverage over that period from \u201915 through \u201920.","We are still comfortable with the first two projections and we are still comfortable that we will have substantial excess coverage. But I have to admit it's hard to ascertain exactly what that will be, that amount will be, given the recent volatility in commodity prices. But as an example in an effort to be as transparent as possible, let's just take a look at 2015.","When we released the outlook in December \u201914 for the year 2015, we based it on $70 oil and $3.80 gas. That\u2019s what we assume and we did our budget back in the fall of \u201914, and it represented the forward curves at that time. We projected $2, declared dividend for \u201915 and that\u2019s up 15% from $1.74 in \u201914 and we said we\u2019d have \u201cover $500 million\u201d of coverage.","As we refined our budget, the actual coverage number in our budgets is much greater. It's $654 million to be precise at those prices that I just mentioned. Now in this world of lower commodity prices, we look closely at the impact on our excess cash and found it to be about $10 million per $1 change in crude price. And that\u2019s about $7 million in our CO2 segment that you heard us mention time and time again pretty consistent from year-to-year and about $3 million throughout all of our other business segments in the Company.","In addition, we think we have sensitivity of about $3 million for each $0.10 change in natural gas prices. Like everyone, we are unable to predict exactly where the prices will be for \u201915, but you can make your own estimate and see that almost under any circumstances we have substantial excess coverage and I think relatively little sensitivity compared to a company that will produce about $8 billion in earnings before DD&A.","Now in an effort to be even more transparent, and without predicting prices at all, let me just take you through an example. Let's say you want to take our outlook and say I believe we are going to have an average of $50 WTI crude price this year at an average of $3.20 on Henry Hub natural gas price. What would that do to this $654 -- $654 million of excess coverage on top of the $2 dividend? You would start with the crude and you\u2019d say crude is going down by $20 a barrel, our sensitivity is $10 million per dollar therefore that\u2019s a $200 million degradation.","On the natural gas side, if we went from 3.80 to 3.20, that's a $0.60 degradation, which would be six times $3 million or $18 million. That gets you to a total of $218 million. You take that off the 654, and you got $436 million of excess coverage still there over and above paying a $2 dividend.","Now let me be real clear. There is obviously a myriad of factors beyond price that influence the accomplishment of any annual plan. But I\u2019d emphasize that the commodity sensitivities that I have just outlined do not, do not include the positive impact of cost reductions in our CO2, EOR operations, which we\u2019re working on and believe will happen and which certainly happened back in 2008 and 2009, the last time we had a dramatic change in crude oil prices to the negative.","So hopefully that gives you some guidance and rather than us trying to redo numbers, you can do your own figuring of the outlook we gave you back in December, but the bottom line message from me would be that we still have lots of excess coverage, and you can roll that forward to other years and talk about exactly where the excess coverage is and it gets even more difficult obviously the further out you go, because who knows where the prices will be there -- will be then. But I think the main thing is, this kind of toll road structure that we have allows us to survive and prosper very nicely even in a low commodity price environment.","Now when I'm finished, Steve is going to detail our current backlog of projects which remain very strong and this backlog is to me a clear indicator of future growth and cash flow at KMI.","Now let me close by -- my part of the presentation by addressing succession planning at Kinder Morgan. I have said publicly for some time that our Kinder Morgan succession plan called for Steve Kean, to succeed me as CEO with me continuing as Executive Chairman. We now expect that change will take effect on June 1, 2015.","Let me make a few points for you. First of all, I can assure you this is not going to change in any way the Company -- the way the Company is being run. Secondly, my name is on the door and I don't plan to go anywhere. The Office of the Chair will still consist of Steve, Kim and myself and post June 1st, I\u2019ll still be involved in all major decisions including acquisitions and expansion projects.","I want to also assure you, I\u2019ve never sold a share of my KMI stock and I don\u2019t intend to do so in the future. So to kind of sum that area up as we say in Texas, I plan to die with my boots on. But more importantly, Steve, Kim and the rest of the management team are doing a really outstanding job now and I can assure you they will continue to do so in the future and that this Company will continue to grow and meet its commitments to its shareholders, its customers, and its employees.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right. Thanks, Rich. And briefly I want to say I\u2019m honored to have the opportunity, particularly coming from Rich, who is one of the best and most accomplished CEOs in America, who by the way, still has his boot on.","I'm also ready and committed and determined to do my part here. So I'm excited by the opportunity, but there is no reason for any of you to be -- as Rich said, you can count on his active involvement and you can count on Kim and me, the leadership team here and our 11,000 co-workers to run this great network of assets safely, profitably and reliably everyday and continue to grow the Company. So this will be the most seamless transition in the history of corporate America.","So now let\u2019s do the quarter. Backlog first and then our segment update. On the backlog since our investor conference in January of 2014, we have grown our backlog by nearly $2.8 billion. Our current backlog stands at 17.6, which is down slightly from the last quarter. Over the quarter, we added 1.24 billion of projects, while we put into service $730 million worth of projects for a net addition of about $500 million. But the impact of lower commodity prices let us to reexamine our CO2 investments and we were moved from the backlog a little under $800 million for the quarter and the majority of that came out of the backlog for the CO2 segment.","The additions to the backlog, were in our pipelines and terminals businesses. The largest being the addition of Palmetto refined products pipeline serving the Southeast U.S. That project includes the pipeline. It also includes an upstream expansion of the plantation pipeline system and associated terminal investments and the total to our share assuming others opt in for their shares would be about $800 million. Now the additions to the terminals and pipelines backlog underscore the continued strong demand for our midstream energy infrastructure.","Now brief Segment review and I'm going to focus on the performance on a full-year basis compared to 2013. In gas, earnings before DD&A were up $352 million or 9% year-over-year to $4.069 billion. The gas segment benefited from a full-year of the assets that we acquired from Copano, including some growth in those assets as well as strong performance from our Tennessee and El Paso system.","We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity. So, even in this fourth quarter that we just went through, we added another 242 million cubic feet a day of long-term transportation commitments with an average term of 12.8 years. So if you look at the total going back to December of 2013, since that time over that 13 months we\u2019ve added 6.7 Bcf of new and pending commitments with an average term length of 17 years. That's about 18% of the capacity of the underlying pipeline systems those commitments are associated with.","We expect the demand to continue as I think we\u2019re still at the beginning of what ultimately be needed both for power generation and industrial and PetChem load. We are also seeing improvements in storage opportunities. I think, first in the current market, but also in terms of the long-term commitments. We got a firm long-term commitment of 3 Bcf of storage on our Texas Intrastate system by an LNG customer during the quarter. And I think all of this on the transport and storage side points to continued optimism about the overall value of our gas network.","CO2 segment earnings before DD&A were up $26 million or 2%. But looking at the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, the segment was down 6%. So clearly we faced deteriorating commodity prices in the fourth quarter, but operationally we saw record years at SACROC, which was up 8% year-over-year and was averaging 35,500 barrels a day in the fourth quarter and a record CO2 volumes and NGL production.","Yates was down slightly 2% year-over-year and although Katz and Goldsmith are up on a full-year basis, both continue to perform below plan. But in total, oil production is up due to the outperformance at SACROC which is our biggest field. As I said, we\u2019ve reduced our backlog in the segment while we continue to have many good investment opportunities here. We will lay some of those out at the conference. We delayed plans on various new developments including the St. Johns Field and associated pipeline infrastructure with that development.","Turning to products, segment earnings before DD&A on a full-year basis were up $76 million or 10% with strong year-over-year growth on KMCC and SFPP more than offsetting a decline in our transmix business. The key operational developments in this segment are improved refined products volumes and a ramp up in crude and condensate volume on KMCC.","All refined product lines gasoline, diesel inject were up in 2014 versus 2013, including plantation gasoline volumes were up 4.4% for the full-year versus 1.5% without plantation and 1.1% for the EIA. Much of the full-year difference is due to plantation therefore, but in the fourth quarter, we saw gasoline volumes on SFPP, our West Coast system up 4.4% year-over-year and what we believe is a sign of economic improvement in the markets we serve and also in part perhaps the beginning of a demand response to lower prices.","From a project standpoint and product, we\u2019re experiencing a further delay in our Houston Ship Channel splitter project on the KMCC system. We now expect March 2015 in service. On the other hand, our various build outs of the KMCC system are going very well with several of them coming in ahead of schedule and\/or under budget. And I already mentioned Palmetto, which had a successful open season in the fourth quarter and was added to the backlog.","In Terminals, segment earnings before DD&A for the year were up $181 million or 23%. The growth was split roughly two thirds, one third in favor of organic growth versus growth from acquisition. We continue to see strong performance in our Gulf coast liquids business and benefited from the expansions coming online in Edmonton and the Houston Ship Channel primarily.","During the quarter, we brought online Phase 2 of Edmonton, two crude by rail facilities and our liquids terminal expansion for Methanex at Geismar, Louisiana. In this segment we continue to see strong demand for liquid storage and handling, again particularly in Edmonton and Houston. And nearly all of our $2.1 billion backlog in this segment consists of expansions of our liquids facilities and again on the Gulf Coast and in Alberta.","On Canada, our segment earnings here were down $17 million year-over-year. That was really a result of FX; otherwise the segment had a good year. But the main story continues to be our progress on the $5.4 billion expansion of Trans Mountain. That expansion is under long-term contracts as you remember, they\u2019ve been improved by the NAV. We filed our facilities application in December \u201913 and we\u2019re working through that process under schedule that calls for a decision in January 2016 and we expect in service date late in the third quarter of 2018.","We continue to make good progress in our consultation processes. We also recently completed some important though controversial testing at one of the mountain in Greater Vancouver. And that will enable us to minimize impacts on local residence for the last few kilometers of our build. So that\u2019s it for the segment update and the projects.","And with that, turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Okay. So turning to the attached page numbers to the press release. The first page is our GAAP income statement. As Rich said, it was a -- it\u2019s a bit of a noisy quarter given the closing of the transaction about two thirds of the way through the quarter and we\u2019ve got a number of certain items that are littered through the GAAP income statement. So I\u2019m going to turn to the second page, which is where we have these items delineated, so that you can see them individually, and also is our calculation of distributable cash flow for KMI.","Now this is a new format for KMI. Previously KMI, we use the financial metric cash available for dividends. We\u2019ve now converted KMI for the DCF formula, we previously used for KMP and EPB, which is net income plus DD&A, including our share of joint venture DD&A plus book taxes minus cash taxes minus sustaining CapEx including our share of JV sustaining CapEx and plus or minus some other small adjustment.","This formula will work for all the periods presented, even though its prior to the consolidation transaction, because KMI consolidates KMP and EPB, so net income at KMI includes a 100% of the earnings for all three companies. For periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, we subtract from our DCF formula the declared distributions we made to KMP and EPB public unitholders resulting in a number per DCF that it is equal to what we previously reported as KMI\u2019s cash available to pay dividends.","For the fourth quarter, there will not be distributions made to KMP and EPB unitholders, because the transaction close before the fourth quarter record date. So there will be no MLP distributions to subtract. However, the KMI shares that we issued in November will receive the full KMI fourth quarter dividend. So when our average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter we show the newly issued shares as outstanding for the entire fourth quarter. So with that explanation of the overall format and the new format let me take you through a couple of numbers. This is the format that we\u2019d -- we expect to continue to use going forward.","The DCF for certain items in the fourth quarter was $1.278 billion, that\u2019s up $796 million. You can see that the 2.133 billion shares outstanding again include the newly issued shares for the entire fourth quarter to get us to $0.60 DCF per share available versus the $0.45 dividend.","For the full-year, we\u2019re at $2.618 billion of DCF, up $905 million. Again, the weighted average shares here 1.3 billion shares include a full fourth quarter of the newly issued shares to get us to $2 in distributable cash flow before certain items versus the $1.74.","The segments let me go through a couple of numbers. Steve has taken you through a lot of the detail. The segments produced our earnings before DD&A of $1.972 billion in the quarter. That\u2019s up $98 million or 5% with the big contributors that -- to that being Gas up $51 million or 5% and Terminals up $56 million or 25%. For the full-year, segment earnings before DD&A up $630 million or 9% with the biggest contributors being Natural Gas pipelines up $352 million or 9%. Terminals up $181 million or 23% and Products pipeline up $76 million.","Now versus our budget for the full-year, natural gas pipelines came in above their budget. They\u2019re about 2% above their budget, primarily because of incremental transport revenues on TGP and EPNG. CO2 came in about 6% or $90 million below its budget primarily due to lower oil prices and a higher mid-cush spread and also some higher expenses at our Goldsmith field.","Our products came in about $68 million below its budget primarily because of volume -- lower volumes by KMCC, a lot of which we will receive revenue in later years, make up revenue and the delay in the splitter. And then Terminals came in about $10 million above its budget as a result of the APT acquisition. Without the APT acquisition, Terminals would have been below its budget because of some lower coal volumes, expansion delays and negative impact of FX.","The certain items in the quarter that were totaled $98 million loss. The more significant ones were the $235 million impairment on our Katz field, primarily -- all due to the lower price curves that we\u2019ve to use in that task. And then we also had a benefit that offset that, a non-recurring tax benefit of about a little over $100 million. So that is for the DCF page, for KMI for the quarter.","Looking at KMI\u2019s balance sheet and comparing that to December \u201914 balance sheet to the December \u201913 balance sheet, you can see the impact of the transaction primarily in four or five different lines. In deferred charges and deferred income tax, what\u2019s happening there is KMI was previously in a deferred tax liability position, because of the step up on the transaction and the [indiscernible] tax basis that we\u2019re getting in the assets, we actually now have a deferred tax asset and so you see a big swing between deferred income taxes and the assets deferred charges.","You also see a big increase in other shareholders equity and a reduction in non-controlling interest as the public unitholders of EPB and KMP went away and we issued new KMI shares. The other large change is that which I\u2019m going to reconcile for you in just a minute. We ended the quarter with $40.6 billion of debt, which is about 5.5 times debt to EBITDA relatively consistent with where we expect it to end.","Our debt is up $5.1 billion for the quarter and so let me take you through those the larger changes contributing to that. The consolidation transaction was a cash outflow of about $4.06 billion that was 3.9 for the cash portion of the deal plus associated fees. Expansion CapEx, acquisitions and contributions to equity investments were about $1.1 billion in the quarter and then we made a CPC settlement payment of about $319 million for a cash outflow of $5.5 billion.","We raised equity prior to the close of the transaction at EPB, there was ATM of $126 million and then we have about $250 million cash inflow from other items or working capital source, which is primarily the coverage that we generated in the quarter and that gets you to the $5.1 billion.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Dax.","Dax Sanders","Thanks, Kim. Just to reiterate what Rich says, this is an acquisition that we\u2019re very excited about is it will give us a premier asset in a premier basin. At this point, we have a significant presence in every major producing region in North America, except the Bakken. With this acquisition, we will now have a major position in the Bakken and a long-term partnership with some of the most prolific producers in the Bakken, including Continental Resources.","To give you a bit of detail on the transaction, it is again approximately $3 billion in total enterprise value, very slightly accretive out of the gate, but based on our assumptions , it should be $0.06 to $0.07 accretive a couple of years out. Looking through the lens of 2015 expected EBITDA; approximately 86% of the margin is fee-based with the remaining 14% subject to commodity exposure, primarily through POP processing arrangements in the gas processing and gathering segment.","There are essentially three main businesses to Hiland. The first is oil gathering, which consists of four facilities represents approximately 59% of the EBITDA and it\u2019s almost exclusively fee-based with really no direct commodity exposure. Hiland serves most of the major producers in the Bakken and has over 1.8 million acres dedicated with a large piece of that centered at what many considered to be the Tier 1 portion of the Bakken as Rich mentioned.","The second is oil transportation, which is essentially the Double H pipeline. Double H represents approximately 27% of 2015 EBITDA and it\u2019s a 100% fee-based. Double H is a 485 mile pipe extending from the Dore Terminal in McKenzie County, North Dakota along the North Dakota\/Montana border down to Guernsey, Wyoming where it ties into Pony Express. It includes 500,000 barrels of storage in two trunk stations. It\u2019s in the process of being commissioned right now with the initial capacity of being approximately 84,000 barrels a day, but increasing to approximately 108,000 barrels a day at the beginning of next year.","Just to understand by firm commitments for approximately 60,000 barrels a day with an open-season in process right now for an addition -- for additional barrels, again, currently in process. As of Monday, Double H had nominations for approximately 80,000 barrels for February, which is its first full month in operation.","The third business is gas gathering and process, and which consists of five different facilities, and represents approximately 14% of the EBITDA. It\u2019s almost exclusively non-fee-based or commodity exposed through the POPs that I mentioned earlier. Again, the largely fee-based nature of these assets limits our direct commodity exposure -- exposure to commodity prices. However, it\u2019s certainly not lost on us that there is indirect commodity exposure in that the economics of these assets are in part dependent upon whether the oil behind them continues to be produced.","We believe that the risk of the oil being produced is largely mitigated by the quality of the acreage that is dedicated to Hiland and will be driving the economics of the oil gathering. As we mentioned in the release, the acreage driving our economics is largely located in McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams counties and represents some of the best drilling economics in the Bakken and in North America.","Consequently, we believe this acreage is economic to producers even in the current commodity environment. Some Bakken producers, including some of our customers have publicly revised our guidance for drilling in CapEx in recent weeks to account for the current commodity environment and we have taken that into account in our analysis. Further, while nobody can really contemplate what will result from a substantial decline in commodity prices from here, the relative attractiveness of the acreage should position us well versus other acreage competing for a finite number of rigs in such an environment.","Again, to summarize, we believe this is a highly strategic acquisition with some premier assets that largely fit our toll road concept and are located in an area where we\u2019ve had no presence. We will be inheriting a very talented group of employees, that have built a great company and we look forward to doing great things with this franchise.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Dax. And Sharon, if you will come back on, now we will take any questions that our listeners may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Rich, first wanted to offer congratulations on your accomplishments and Steve also wanted to congratulate you on your upcoming expanded responsibilities.","Rich Kinder","Well, thank you. You\u2019re kind.","Shneur Gershuni","Thank you. Just a couple of quick questions here. I was wondering if we can talk a little bit more about today\u2019s acquisition. You\u2019ve had a lot of pundits out there talking about the Bakken, with production being flat at best possibly declines and so forth. I was wondering if kind of the opportunity over the next couple of years as you see accretion pick up, is that a function of moving some of the trucking volumes onto the pipeline system? Is that kind of how we expect to see the opportunity on a go-forward basis kind of given the bleak environment that we\u2019ve out there for the Bakken?","Rich Kinder","Again, let me start with this, and I'm not sure if we posted this on the Web site, but if not, we should have. If you look at acreage around the country and what are the breakeven price is based on WTI prices, this area of the Bakken is right at the top of the list. It's one of the two top producing basins in terms of breakeven prices. So we don\u2019t think that it is nearly as bleak as other parts of production are if you want to use that word. ","Secondly, obviously a big part of the upside is a ramp up in this Double H pipeline. We are starting out in the 80,000 barrel per day range ramping up to about beginning of next year 108,000. And again, we believe that the combination and as you may know, there is a joint tariff arrangement between Double H pipeline and the Pony Express line that gets you all the way to Cushing and then of course there is several avenues now to get from Cushing on down to the Gulf Coast. And we believe by putting all that together, we provide by far the most economic way of getting barrels out of this very sweet spot in the Bakken. So we think HH is a real winner, both near-term and long-term. So that\u2019s part of it. ","The other thing is that we have looked at the EURs on these wells, we have looked very carefully at the drilling plan of our largest customer, and we have adjusted for exactly what they plan to do, what we believe they plan to do with the rig counts that have already been announced. So we think we\u2019ve been pretty conservative in the way we have assessed this and believe that it\u2019s an incredible asset for us. Now let me say that beyond that I think we have the opportunities I said in my opening remarks to do here kind of what we did in the Eagle Ford on KMCC and that is to build out this system to make it bigger to do some acquisitions to do some extensions and the fact that we have about 1.8 million acres dedicated to this. I think it shows -- will show very well in the long-term. And look -- we had to look at this in the long-term, not in the flavor of exactly what\u2019s happening today. So we think long winded way of saying, we think we\u2019ve been very conservative in looking at the front end of this transaction and still think it has enormous long-term growth potential.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And just a follow-up on that. In terms of permanent financing plans, any sense on an equity to debt ratio that you\u2019re thinking about?","Rich Kinder","Yes, we\u2019ve been very clear since the time we announced the merger last August, after meeting with the rating agencies that we\u2019d stay in that band of 5.5 to 5.0 debt to EBITDA and certainly driving that down towards the lower end of the range as we move on out toward 2020. We\u2019ve been very consistent on that. We\u2019ve said that the Holy Grail for us is maintaining our investment grade rating.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And one final question. You had mentioned in the prepared remarks that you had taken out a little under $800 million from your backlog out of the CO2 business due to lower commodity prices. I was wondering if you can sort of share the commodity price that you\u2019d assume to take that out was that -- was it $70, was it $50, just trying to understand the sensitivity to see if that\u2019s possibly going to change on a go-forward basis given where crude prices are today?","Steve Kean","Yes, I don\u2019t have a specific price for you, but what we did and in a lot of cases what we're doing is delaying our expectation of making these investments and in some cases that was delaying it outside of the five-year window that we typically used for defining the backlog. We are going to give you at conference next week some more specific return numbers to go with various development activities that we have going on. But I think the way to kind of slice it is, it is very economic for us to do CO2 development and pipeline work where we\u2019re expanding kind of off of our existing footprint. So like Southwest Colorado with Cow Canyon and the Cortez pipeline, particularly the North part of that expanding that to make that available and it\u2019s certainly very economic for us to be doing infill drilling in SACROC and additional HDHs at Yates. And so the kinds of things that are building off of and utilizing our existing infrastructure are very economic. And if you have a price recovery that's back in the $70, $75 range I think you'd see some of those projects that we pushed out or pushed off coming back on.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Steve Kean","One other clarification that $800 million, that was predominantly CO2, but there were few other cats and dogs in there as well, but it was predominantly CO2.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Go ahead your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey, Darren, good afternoon.","Darren Horowitz","Hey, Rich. Good afternoon and Rich and Steve congratulations to both of you on your respective announcements. Rich, just a quick question and I realize you are going to get into a lot more detail on this next week, but I\u2019m just curious with the current forward commodity curve, have you seen a big shift away from more producer push to more demand pull or consumer pull type projects and specifically with regard to export opportunities around Galena Park, the Ship Channel. I know we\u2019ve talked about ultra low sulfur diesel exports and obviously that big tank expansion that you\u2019ve discussed that was underwritten by a new shipper, but I\u2019m also thinking about more of an emphasis on Pasadena in addition to Galena Park, further Bosco build out, more ability to get more product on the water quicker.","Rich Kinder","I will turn that over to John Schlosser, who runs our Terminals Group.","John Schlosser","Yes. We're looking at 35 million barrels right now. We have six different projects we're working on that will bring it up to 41 million barrels. We are going from 8 docks to 11 docks. So we feel we have the premier footprints in North America for clean products and we see more projects and more growth opportunities in that area as we go forward here.","Darren Horowitz","In terms of aggregate CapEx and maybe it\u2019s too early to do this, but can you put a rough cost number on that and is it fair to assume unlevered cash on cash returns may be in the low to mid-teen range?","John Schlosser","Yes, we\u2019re managing actively right now a little under $2 billion worth of projects on the Houston Ship Channel between Bosco, Pasadena and Galena Park and some of our other expansions.","Darren Horowitz","Okay.","John Schlosser","And the returns are all in the low to mid teens.","Darren Horowitz","Okay. And then, last question for me maybe \u2026","Rich Kinder","We subscribe over term contracts from our customers. So it\u2019s not like building tankage on spec here.","Darren Horowitz","Sure, sure. And then, Rich last question for me maybe, as you are looking at the existing opportunities that obviously with the challenges across natural gas, natural gas liquids and crude oil prices. In terms of cash on cash returns are the best bang for your buck with regard to allocating capital, is this the biggest area of opportunity for you?","Rich Kinder","Well, I think we have got opportunities across the board. I think - I said last August when we announced this that what we\u2019d have is a much lower cost of capital under the new arrangement or a lower hurdle rate, if you will, which again on after-tax basis is about 3.5%. And not that we are going to do 4% projects, but it gives us a lot more leeway to make accretive acquisitions and we\u2019re certainly going to use that currency to make good acquisitions. And I think that if there is a silver lining in these clouds of low commodity prices, it\u2019s going to be the ability to make some extremely good acquisitions over the next 6 to 12 months. Now we\u2019re not the only player here that\u2019s going to be looking at the same thing, there are other well capitalized midstream companies, but I think you\u2019re going to see consolidation opportunities and everything I said last August I think is even more true today than it was then, given the decline in prices.","Darren Horowitz","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Olsen of TPH. Go ahead your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, Brad. How are you this afternoon?","Brad Olsen","Hey, good afternoon Rich. How are you?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Brad Olsen","My first question is really just a follow-up on some of these others -- on the Hiland acquisition. You guys mentioned that there would be some incremental CapEx and I\u2019m kind of -- I'm just trying to understand where that CapEx is going to go? Is there additional construction left on the double H pipeline or is that further building out the crude gathering or the GMP asset footprint?","Rich Kinder","I\u2019ll ask Dax to answer that question.","Dax Sanders","Yes, Brad. We think that we will be able to invest roughly $850 million from call it 2015 through 2018. There is kind of an aggregate oil well connects, some gas well connects remaining CapEx on the Double H. The Double H has roughly $30 million left spent to spend and a little bit more than that to spend to get it up to roughly 108,000 barrels. Now what that doesn\u2019t contemplated all is substantial expansion of the Double H, Rich is something that we will certainly be put in time and got an opportunity into. But that gets us up to in the 108,000 barrels a day.","Brad Olsen","Got it. And so, safe to say that the vast majority of the remaining $800 million is gathering and processing and crude gathering?","Dax Sanders","I think that\u2019s right.","Brad Olsen","Okay, got it. And when you think about kind of the competitive environment in the Bakken, some other midstream operators have made asset acquisitions up there over the last few years, and when you think about kind of what percentage of the market is spoken for under long-term midstream agreements and what might still be up for grabs? Do you see an opportunity to attract incremental customers?","Dax Sanders","Yes. I guess, what I would say is that as we mentioned in the release we\u2019ve got good long existing relationships with a lot of different customers, including some very prolific producers out there, but we don\u2019t have them all. We haven\u2019t necessarily -- we have really good acreage dedications with the ones we do have which make us feel really good about this business, but there are some that have and doesn\u2019t have the historical relationship with that we do have a relationship with and we will absolutely be spending a lot of time to try to -- to try solidify this relationships with the Hiland assets.","Brad Olsen","Got it. I guess, shifting gears a bit to the natural gas pipeline side of things, it looks like you guys are still pushing forward on the Northeast direct project and I was -- there have been some press releases out about some of the work you\u2019re doing around multiple different rights of way, how is that process going? I guess, from a kind of simplistic view which is really the only view that I do -- the simplistic view is going to New York State, moving along a right of way that\u2019s similar to constitution which has become kind of regulatory quagmire. What seems to be a really encouraging project with a lot of customers who seem excited about it that right of way issue kind of sticks out as something that could delay timing or cause problems. There are -- is that point of view accurate or fair?","Rich Kinder","I don\u2019t really think it is. And let me tell you why we have adjusted this write away so that today the huge percentage of the write away is along utility easements. Now there\u2019s certainly people who are going to say not in my backyard, but that\u2019s why we have Berk as enabling agency and we will have in fact, we are going to have forgotten how many open houses here in the next few weeks actually this is a winner in all these communities talking about it. But in the end we will have a route, and we would expect the Berk to approve that route because it is reasonable and look, you have to look at the underlying economic need here. If there is one area of the United States that needs additional natural gas it is New England. And the area of New England with this ending at Dracut is exactly the location where you need to be in order to serve that market which initially will be LDCs, and you can see how we\u2019ve announced the LDCs in the pass who have signed up. We now have reduced almost all those to PAs and longer term of course beyond the LDCs in the end the power generation market in New England has to have more capacity on pipelines. It just can't work any other way and we plan to be there to catch that ball when it comes off the backboard. So, I think we can do this. We\u2019re proceeding very in close consultation with everybody up there including our customers and including government officials. And I\u2019m astounded sometimes, frankly and this goes beyond this project. I\u2019m astounded that even as recently as a couple of years ago, people I believe -- the general public rightfully believe that natural gas is the savior. It emits half as much emissions as other power generation alternatives for example, and it\u2019s the lowest emitting fossil fuel, this is the bridge fuel for the future even if we -- you believe will eventually move more to renewables. And now we\u2019ve got a cautery of people around the country assumed to be attacking every expansion of every pipeline, and I just -- I still believe in the common sense of the American people and the regulators, and I think in the end projects that are really needy like this will get approved and will get built. Now let me emphasize that there is not one damn set of that North East direct project, either the supply portion or the market portion that is in the backlog that Steve took you through. So this is a project that we\u2019re working on and if it gets built it would be added into everything we projected for you thus far.","Brad Olsen","That\u2019s great color, Rich. I appreciate all the color everyone. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital. Go ahead sir. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Carl, how are you doing?","Carl Kirst","Good afternoon. Good, good. Thank you, and certainly congratulations to both of you. And just, maybe if I could stick with NED for a second, because I\u2019m just curious now from the other aspect, from the commercial aspect. Is there any better sense of how the market is shaking out from the demand pull aspect, i.e. what, perhaps Maine might do to kind of push you over the finish line or anybody else for that matter?","Rich Kinder","I\u2019ll let, Tom Martin who runs our natural gas pipeline to answer that.","Tom Martin","Thanks, Rich. Now as he said, as Rich said we have gotten most of our LDC part of this project summed up. So, it is really going to the State of Maine and ultimately the power customers that will be the next phase. And we think over the next quarter maybe two at the most as we will have a very clear picture on getting those commitments in place to, we believe to move forward with this project. But a lot of work to be done between now and then, certainly need to work with the state and local officials as well as the commercial aspects of the these transactions and all the -- as Rich said, all the people that need this commodity have been very positive towards this project and we are very optimistic that we\u2019ll get this done.","Carl Kirst","Understood. So it sounds like this spring is still at least a potentially still a realistic scenario as far as knowing how the chips are going to fall.","Tom Martin","Spring into mid-year. Yes.","Carl Kirst","Okay. If I could ask a question on the CO2 business only because Rich I think you mentioned that the current budget for instance does not include any of the potential benefits of cost reductions, and I\u2019m just curious in the experience of 2008 and 2009 if there is any sense of magnitude of what that was back then as far as possible offset we maybe looking at this year.","Rich Kinder","Yes, Jesse.","Jesse Arenivas","Yes, thanks. I think our target is going to be at 15% of our total operating budget. Keep in mind our 40% of that is tied to natural gas prices or correlated to the natural gas price which is power. So, we\u2019re shooting for an overall 15% reduction in cost roughly $30 million of the non-committed dollars. In regards to 2008, 2009 we were able to achieve a little higher percentage of that, but what we\u2019ve learned through that period is that we tied a lot of our drilling and well work programs in contracts to crude price. So when we lowered the budget to $70, there\u2019s already a wedge out of that. So in aggregate it\u2019s probably going to be closer to the 20% consistent to what we got in \u201908 and \u201909.","Rich Kinder","And obviously, Carl, he\u2019s talking just about the O&M, the operating budget. There will also be savings on the capital side. But as far as impact on 2015 reducing the O&M cost we believe 15% is a good solid number, and they\u2019ve already achieved about a third of that with contracts. They\u2019ve already renegotiated just since the first of the year. So, I think we will have that. And again, there will be a lot of moving parts obviously in this kind of environment, but we don\u2019t have that in place with our numbers yet.","Carl Kirst","Understood. And then lastly if I could, this is just sort of, I guess a micro question, but to the extent that we saw the excess coverage again keeping the $70 oil plan moving up from $500 million to $650 million -- $654 million. Was that basically just a nuance to the bonus depreciation at year end, or was there something more going on there?","Rich Kinder","Kim?","Kim Dang","Sir. That was just Carl, we went out with our budgets where all the pieces were in place here and so we went with over $500 million. It was over -- it was $600 million at the top, but one of the moving pieces was that we were finalizing some of the tax purchase price allocation and so that\u2019s why we went out with an estimate as opposed to a precise number.","Carl Kirst","Understood. I appreciate the clarification. Thanks guys.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Carl.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Go ahead, your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere","Good afternoon, and congrats Rich and Steve and the whole team. When the market was questioning I\u2019m not understanding as much, a year ago you guys kept a steady sale and simplified things dramatically. Congratulations for job well done.","Rich Kinder","Thank you.","Craig Shere","Couple of questions here, on the EOR side, really great growth at SACROC, Katz was also up I think 6% sequentially. Can we get some more color on that and also the ramping trends that Katz and Goldsmith that maybe was behind schedule over the last couple of quarters and can you comment on appetite for EOR growth CapEx initiatives in the current environment with things like ROZ or the Yates NGL flood?","Rich Kinder","Yes, and Craig we\u2019re going to go into lot more detail next week at the analyst conference. In fact I think Jesse has got a slide that\u2019s going to show you basically what returns are at various WTI prices broken out by SACROC, Yates, Katz, ROZ, so on. But I think the huge story or success story here is that SACROC, and you\u2019re going to see next week that once again that if you\u2019ve attended our conferences every year people asked whether SACROC start this inevitable decline? And I remember at one time it was going to be 2008, 2009, then it was 2014, 2017, 2018. We continue to move that out because frankly it is just a fantastic field and we\u2019re now doing a lot of infill drilling that is very economic. It gets more economic than putting on new patterns by a fair margin. And again Steve gave you the average for the year and for the fourth quarter. Starting this year, we\u2019re right at 37,000 barrels a day at SACROC and our budget that we set for this year is about 33,000 barrels a day and now we\u2019ll have moving parts elsewhere in CO2, but thus far we\u2019re off to a very good start and it\u2019s largely due to SACROC. So we see that. Certainly the ROZ, I think is at the upper end of the curve in terms of clearing price versus something like infill drilling at SACROC, and we\u2019ll just have to see how that comes out. But certainly the money we\u2019re spending now on our test patterns there is economic given the cost we\u2019ve already presented, it\u2019s very economic on a going forward basis. And then we\u2019ll just reassess that for that on where the prices are. Steve or Jesse, do you want to add something? They\u2019re nodding their head, so I guess they\u2019re agreeing.","Craig Shere","Okay. And just one more question, it would be on an ongoing basis quarterly if maybe we could kind of track the growth CapEx inventory or portfolio relative to what was originally envisioned when you issued your original guidance through 2020, I realize there\u2019s some moving parts including commodity prices. But where do we stand right now in terms of maybe needing just a couple of billion dollars more at the same commodity prices you originally assumed to fulfill that long-term growth guidance.","Rich Kinder","Well, go ahead Steve.","Steve Kean","I was just going to say, I think that we can give you some more insight into that. But it\u2019s very hard to define what in -- what people have called our shadow backlog is going to fall into the backlog. But we believe we\u2019re going to get a substantial piece of additional CapEx beyond what we\u2019re showing you in the backlog and our performance over the year and from quarter-to-quarter is generally demonstrating that too. The other thing that\u2019s hard to incorporate in there is acquisitions like the one we\u2019re talking about today. We expect we\u2019re going to see those as well. So those are shots that are just a little bit harder to call. But you have -- you\u2019re making a good point. Certainly with some additional capital deployment in our existing businesses we can call back some of the damage done in our CO2 business from lower commodity prices. So we can help get back some of what would have otherwise been a deterioration from the transaction that we were talking about back in August.","Craig Shere","Sure. I guess, that was my point of just making up the free cash flow that was originally guided and maybe getting to the point eventually being able to increase the 10% CAGR on the dividend?","Rich Kinder","We would certainly -- that\u2019s our intent too. And again as you can see I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of positive cash flow even with lower commodity prices. It\u2019s just harder to judge on a going forward basis. But the reason I took you through \u201915 is that\u2019s something that I can get my pea-sized brain around and so you can see that in the year like \u201915 and I\u2019m not saying that, that\u2019s the same every year, but you can kind of see where you are, and the impact of commodity pricing on the bottom line in terms of distributable cash flow and excess coverage.","Craig Shere","Great. Thank you very much. I look forward to next week.","Rich Kinder","Good.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi, John. How are you doing today?","John Edwards","Doing well, Rich, and congrats on your upcoming transition, I guess, well deserved.","Rich Kinder","We are great. Steve\u2019s as good as they come. Not going to be hanging around. So, go ahead.","John Edwards","Well congrats to Steve as well. But I\u2019m just curious on the highland deal, if you can give us an idea of the economics behind the acreage that\u2019s dedicated in other words maybe what the breakeven costs are for that acreage?","Rich Kinder","Yes, I don\u2019t know if we -- and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Dax. Dax I don\u2019t honestly know whether we posted any slides on the Web site yet. I think we\u2019re going to. And the one that we used with the Board today I thought was very good. Dax, do you want to kind of take it through that?","Dax Sanders","Yes, absolutely. I think John a couple of things -- couple of sources, generally I think if you look at one source I think and this is publicly available is a presentation the Continental Resources who is a pretty well respected producer up there put on our Web site based on a presentation couple of weeks ago, and they show a graph that shows effectively a PV-10 at a WTI price of effectively 40 bucks and assuming no modest amount of cost cut from this kind of department. So, that\u2019s one piece of data out there. Lets just say and again that\u2019s in terms of the WTI price. We\u2019ve got another I guess piece of information from a bank that shows, effectively Bakken, Tier 1 Bakken being, if you look across different acreages across the United States being really second only to the Eagle Ford Tier 1 in having sort of, again kind of a PV-10 or 10% IRR breakeven with the WTI price in the range of call it $35 to $45, and again that assumed some cost cuts that are probably appropriate for this environment. But those are the types of numbers that we think about them. And again, I think what you heard all these producers say, a lot of these guys have said probably is, they\u2019re reducing rig counts but they are high grading their portfolios and substantially increasing the EOR targets in the wells that they\u2019re drilling and they\u2019re really focusing in on the higher grade acreage and focusing rigs on that acreage. And that\u2019s really kind of what we take into account our analysis.","John Edwards","All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Is there, in terms of those ranges, I mean, is there some percentage. I think you said there was 1.8 million acres dedicated, is there some percentage that say the economics or more at the fringe, say it\u2019s not economic below $60 or $70 -- I mean, its -- I assume its some kind of a curve in terms of how this shakes out?","Dax Sanders","Yes, I would just say that the majority of that acreage is stuff that we believe is concentrated in what we kind of defined is that sweet spot which is again the sort of McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams counties. So, I mean we think that\u2019s \u2013 that really is kind of what's driving that.","Rich Kinder","And just again some touchdowns for you, John, and again a lot of different people have other opinions but the North Dakota, Department of Mineral Resources put out a report on January 8 that ranked the counties in North Dakota by breakeven oil price, and the rankings \u2013 the three counties that were primarily, were the heart of what we have is in is McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail and those were three of the top five counties in North Dakota according to the Department of Mineral resources, and McKenzie has the most rigs. Williams has the second number of rigs and Mountrail has the third largest number of rigs. So, I mean, I think certainly its some -- when you that much acreage 1.8 million acreage, some acreage is going to be better than others and then I got to grow up everything. But certainly we think and believe that we are right in the Tier 1 sweet spot of the Bakken, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have done the deal. And the other thing is we\u2019ve got long-term contracts on this. So again whatever happens in that acreage we feel we\u2019re going to be able to benefit from it and benefit our customers for years to come.","John Edwards","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then you indicate, it\u2019s a 10 times multiple by 2018. What's the multiples for like \u201915, \u201916, \u201917, if you can give that?","Dax Sanders","I think the only guidance we have there is that it is modestly accretive in 2015 and then we build through that 10 times by 2018.","John Edwards","Okay. All right.","Rich Kinder","It\u2019s accretive every year from the get-go. So, I think that\u2019s the important thing.","John Edwards","Okay. Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon, Chris.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hi, Rich. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things -- to follow-up on things that may or may not be in the guidance, I know Carl followed up on some of the cost reductions that might be possible at the CO2 business. I was curious you have mentioned in the fourth quarter the times the impact in Canada, just wondering if that was sort of part of the wait of quarter scrub on what you\u2019re offering for 2015. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to go into more detail in the suite, but I was just curious about the widening Canadian dollar impact.","Kim Dang","Sure, and we can go on to this more next week. But what we have in the budget is 0.92 times for the exchange rate.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And is there any sort of broad sensitivity, Kim that you\u2019ve offered on that?","Kim Dang","We\u2019ll have that for you next week.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Perfect. And then Kim, your kind of last quarter call to offer detail on hedge positions and I think you had commented that you might add sort of end of year-end or beginning in the year sort of look to add additional hedge positions. Just curious if you did that, and if so, if we can get an update on where things stand?","Kim Dang","We continue to add hedges. We have on-going hedge programs right now. We\u2019ve got about 80% of 2015 hedge at about an $80 price, 50% of \u201916 and a $79 price, 32% of \u201917 at the $79 price, and 20% of \u201918 and an $81 price.","Chris Sighinolfi","Great. Okay. And I guess, final question maybe for Steve or for Rich. In terms of the CO2 business I know there was the comment earlier about the CapEx that came out of the five year plan. I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about the impact on -- potential impact on sort of volumes, Rich you had talked about SACROC slide and the slide you guys have about. Eventually when does that asset start declining if and when just wondering how we think about in context of some of the CapEx coming out over the next five years, what perhaps we are to be doing from a model perspective and thinking about that sort of base level of decline on the asset?","Rich Kinder","Well, on SACROC and again this is early. We were kind of seeing the best of both worlds here. We\u2019re actually seeing the ability to increase production with less CapEx intensive programs. So that\u2019s a bit of a change from where we even were I would say six months ago, Jesse and so there\u2019s been some -- there\u2019s been some improvement there which is to keep figuring out better and better ways to get at the oil there. When it comes to the other fields again I think its less about, I think looking at it field by field than it is more about the type of development. So, where we have existing infrastructure in the field. So we\u2019ve got gathering lines, we\u2019ve got injection lines, we\u2019ve got tanks, those sorts of things. The infill part of our program is going to be economic. And what moves to the margins is a new build out or new development, new pattern in the same development. That gets a little closer to the edge, and then a brand new kind of Greenfield development is probably outside the edge. And that\u2019s a real summary way to think about it and again we can get more specific with some specific development plans that we have when we get to the conference next week, but is that covered, Jesse?","Jesse Arenivas","Yes, I think maybe to look at, it\u2019s the backlog I think the question is, heavy weighted towards CO2 development, not the EOR business. So, I think the push out of the 800 million or so is more focused on our new CO2 sourced development and not just the EOR projects. I think that\u2019s the way to look at it.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Thanks a lot for the time guys. I appreciate it.","Jesse Arenivas","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Steinberg of Waveny Capital Management. Go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Good afternoon, Adam.","Adam Steinberg","Hi. Thank you. Hi, how are you?","Rich Kinder","Good.","Adam Steinberg","Good. I\u2019ll eco the comments that others have made in the call about extending our congratulations to you guys. But it seems like the market is not really rewarding some of these accomplishments that you guys have achieved, and Rich, I saw your comments in the release today, but I was wondering maybe you can go further than just saying you won't sell and will the company consider buying back some of the stock and or the want?","Rich Kinder","Would the company consider buying back some of my stock? I\u2019m not \u2026","Adam Steinberg","No, no. Some of the stock in the open market.","Rich Kinder","No, that\u2019s not in our present plans. Again, what we have said is that we\u2019re going to concentrate on this tremendous dividend growth story that we\u2019ve got and be very careful about maintaining our investment grade rating by keeping -- by paying close attention to and keeping that debt to EBITDA in the range that we have talked about over the last six months.","Adam Steinberg","Great. And then just one follow up maybe. You talked about -- you reiterated dividend and guidance in the future. Does today\u2019s acquisition add to that or is it sort of the core business a little weaker and that makes up forth?","Rich Kinder","Well, I think this is additive with what we\u2019re doing today with the accretion and the out years is additive to what we had before. I think you have to look at on separate tracks. In other words what we\u2019ve got here is a tremendous set of assets and admittedly are somewhat I think pretty minor -- in a pretty minor way compared to if you were [indiscernible], but impacted by the lower commodity price, we never denied that. We\u2019ve given you guidance on that. And any acquisitions that we do or any new expansion projects that we had at the backlog we don\u2019t have now will -- if you want to say offset that or will add to it. So, I think we certainly won't do any acquisitions or expansion projects unless they\u2019re accretive to the cash flow.","Adam Steinberg","Got it.

All lines have been placed in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Kim. Before we begin, as usual, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call include forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Exchange Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measurement set forth at the end of KMI\u2019s and KML\u2019s earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions, for a list of important material assumptions, expectations and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","Before turning the call over to Steve and the team, let me make a few quick remarks. As you can see from our excellent 2018 results and our 2019 budget overview already released, the assets at KMI are generating strong and growing cash flow. This is obviously a very good thing but the question is how we deploy that cash in most effective way to benefit our shareholders. On that question, we get lots of suggestions from analyst and investors.","As we have said so frequently, we can use the cash for four different purposes; to pay it out as dividends; to buy-back shares; to pay down debt; and to reinvest in capital projects. Over the past three years, we have used our cash for all of those purposes in varying degrees. We have paid off over $8 billion of debt and reduced our debt-to-EBITDA ratio into our targeted 4.5 level, and had our credit rating upgraded by both S&P by Moody's. We've raised the dividend for $0.50 in 2017 to $0.80 in 2018, and reiterated our intention to increase it to $1 in 2019 and to $1.25 in 2020. We have bought back over $500 million worth of shares and we have funded our growth capital without leading to access external sources.","Now in my view that's pretty positive story. You can prevail about how the money gets allocated, but I believe investors should appreciate the overall flexibility that this strong cash flow provides. And we will continue to use our cash flow in a disciplined way that most benefits our shareholders. As we have said so many times the management and board of KMI are significant shareholders, and our interests are pari passu with the rest of the shareholder base. Steve?","Steve Kean","Yes, thanks Rich. As usual, we will be updating you on both KMI and KML as I start with the high level overview, and then turn it over to our President, Kim Dang, to give you an update on our segment performance. David Michels, KMI CFO will take you through the numbers. Then Dax Sanders will update you on KML and we'll take your questions on both companies.","The fourth quarter capped a transformative year for KMI as we grew our business, strengthened our balance sheet, increased our dividend and continued to find attractive new opportunities to expand our network. We experienced outstanding performance in our natural gas segment, our largest segment where we saw significant year-over-year growth. We brought expansion projects online and added new project opportunities to the backlog, highlighted by our Permian Express Pipeline Project, which we outlined to you earlier in the year and which brings an additional 2 bcf a day from the Permian basin to our extensive intrastate pipeline network on the US Gulf Coast. That project, like our Gulf Coast Express Project, is secured by long-term contracts.","We experienced a record increase in natural gas supply and demand across the country, and 2019 is projected to be another solid year of growth for U.S. natural gas. That growth drives the value of our existing network and creates opportunities for us to invest capital at attractive returns to expand that network. We have solid contributions from other parts of our business as well and Kim and Dave will take you through our results. We made tremendous progress during 2018 in strengthening our balance sheet. We self-funded our expansion capital expenditures as we have since the latter part of 2015.","We also sold our Trans Mountain Pipeline and the Trans Mountain Expansion Project to CAD4.5 billion Canadian. That transaction allowed us to return substantial value to our KML and KMI shareholders, while enabling the strengthening of our balance sheet and the de-risking of both entities. A large measure as a result of that transaction, we were able to end the year with our debt to EBITDA multiple at 4.5 times candidly exceeding our goal of 5.1 times, which is what was assumed in the 2018 plans. So we had a very good 2018 and as we showed in our 2019 guidance release, we're expecting good year-over-year growth in 2019 as well.","Now we will cover -- we will be focused on our 2018 results in today's call. The timing of this call as always comes right before we do our Investor Day. We will have that next week and we'll go into the details on 2019 at that time.","With that, I'll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Thanks Steve. Natural gas had another outstanding quarter, it was up 8%. Market fundamentals there remain very strong. For the full year, natural gas demand increased from approximately 81 bcf a day to approximately 90 bcf a day, a 9 bcf a day or 11% increase. This is driving nice results on our large diameter pipes.","For the fourth quarter, transport volumes increased approximately 4.5 bcf a day on our transmission system, a 15% growth. Deliveries to LNG facilities were over a bcf in the quarter and that's approximately 400 million cubic feet a day increase versus the fourth quarter of 2017. Power demand on our system for the quarter was up 300 million cubic feet a day and exports to Mexico on Kinder Morgan pipeline were up a little over 70 billion cubic feet per day.","Overall as Steve said this higher utilization of our system a lot of which came without the need to spend capital resulted in nice bottom-line growth in the quarter and longer-term will drive expansion opportunities. On the supply side, we're also seeing nice volume growth. On our gas and crude gathering systems, volumes were up 21% and 13% respectively, driven by higher production in the Haynesville, the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. In the Haynesville, our volumes more than doubled in the quarter and now are over just slightly over a bcf per day.","A few updates on the large projects. On PHP, we have identified opportunities to increase the capacity by about 100 million cubic feet a day and are currently working to sell that capacity. On GCX, we've secured the 100% of the runway, construction is underway and we remain on target for an October 2019 and further. On our Elba Liquefaction Project, we currently anticipate that we will be in service at the end of the first quarter. Of course this has continued to be delayed, but fortunately we do not expect the delays to have a material impact on our costs, given the way our construction and commercial contract is structured.","In our product segment, we benefited from increased contributions from Cochin, Utopia, and Double H, offset somewhat by lower contributions from KMCC due to lower contract rates on that pipe. Refined volumes were up 1%, which is consistent with the EIA. Crude and condensate volumes were up 10% and that\u2019s due to increased volumes on our pipelines in the Eagle Ford. However, there in the Eagle Ford, as I said on KMCC, the impact of those incremental volumes was more than offset by the lower pricing and higher volumes in the Bakken, where volumes were up 38%. NGL volumes were down 11% due to unattractive product differentials. However, the lower volumes here have minimal financial impact given the nature of our contract.","Our terminal business was down 5% in the quarter. The primary driver is a weak payment from Edmonton South to Trans Mountain, and prior to the sale of Trans Mountain was eliminated as an intercompany transaction. Excluding the lease payment, the terminal segment would have been down less than 2%. Our liquids business was accounted for approximately 80% of the segment was essentially flat with expansions in the Houston and Alberta offsetting weakness from the North East. Our bulk business was down due to certain asset divestitures and lower contributions from coal, primarily due to a customer contract expiration and that\u2019s despite higher coal volumes. Our bulk tonnage was up 10% in the quarter with the largest driver being coal volume. Coal volumes were up almost 1 million ton. Our liquid utilization was essentially flat in the quarter.","CO2 segment benefited from higher CO2 prices but that benefit was offset by lower average crude oil price and lower NGL volumes. Net crude oil production was flat versus the fourth quarter of 2017 with increased volumes at SACROC, largely offset by reduced volumes at our smaller fields. SACROC volumes were up 5% versus last year. They were 8% above our plan as we continue to find ways to access the significant remaining lower plays in that field.","Tall Cotton volumes were up 26% versus last year but below budget, and NGL volumes were down 7% in the quarter due to a planned outage, but that has since been remedied. Our net realized crude oil price was down 6% in the quarter and that\u2019s despite a higher WTI price. The WTI hedges we have in place as well as the increase in the mid-Cush differential offset the increase in the WTI price. For 2019 as we told you previously, we substantially hedge the mid-Cush differentials.","And that\u2019s the update on the segments. And with that, I'll turn it over to David Michels.","David Michels","Thanks Kim. Today, we\u2019re declaring dividend of $0.20 per share, which round out our $0.80 per share dividend declared for full year 2018, that\u2019s consistent with our 2018 budget and the plan that we announced to shareholders in July 2017. It also represents 60% increase over the $0.50 we declared for 2017. We also generated distributable cash flow of 2.65 times our declared dividend for the year and KMI had a very good quarter to cap off a very strong year. We grew meaningfully from last year's fourth quarter and ended the full year nicely above plan and nicely above 2017.","In addition, as Steve mentioned, we significantly strengthened our balance sheet during the full year and that strengthening helps result in recent credit rating upgrade by both Moody's and S&P's at mid BBB each as Rich mentioned. On earnings, our revenues were up $149 million or 4% from the fourth quarter 2017 and operating costs were down $101 million or 18%. However, there were certain items both this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2017 that create a little comparability noise. As a reminder, we define certain items as items that are recorded under GAAP that are non-cash or occur sporadically, which we believe are not representative of businesses' ongoing cash generating capability.","So excluding certain items, operating income would have been -- would be up $35 million or $3% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income available to common stockholders for the quarter was $483 million or $0.21 per share, which is an increase of $1.528 billion or $0.68 per share versus the fourth of 2017, a 146% increase. This very large change was driven by a reduction in our deferred tax assets taking as certain items are in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we go through the Federal tax rates cut. That\u2019s a good example of certain items that can make it difficult to compare our business' operating performance period over period.","Looking at earnings adjusted for all certain items, this quarter we generated $565 million of adjusted earnings versus $469 million in first quarter of last year, that\u2019s $96 million improvement or 20% better quarter over quarter. Adjusted earnings per share is $0.25, which is $0.04 or 19% higher than the fourth quarter of 2017.","Moving on to distributable cash flow, EPS per share is $0.56 for the quarter, up $0.03 or 6% from the fourth quarter of 2017. The natural gas segment was the largest driver of that growth. The natural gas segment was up $3 million or 8%, and that segment benefited in multiple parts. As Kim mentioned, EPNG and NGPL were both driven primarily by Permian supply growth. Kinder Hawk and South Texas assets were up, driven by increased volumes from Haynesville and Eagle Ford. CIG was also up through the growing DJ Basin production. Those are partially offset by lower commodity prices impacting our Highland assets and lower contribution from [geology] due to an arbitration ruling calling for contract termination.","Product segment was up $3 million, terminals were down $15 million and CO2 is down $12 million, and cover the main drivers behind the change into those segments. KMC was down -- Kinder Morgan Canada was down $50 million or 100%, and that\u2019s due to the Trans Mountain sale, which closed in August. G&A or general administrative expenses were lower by $66 million, driven by a greater amount of overhead capitalized due to a greater amount of spending on both projects, the non-recurring expenses we incurred during the fourth quarter of 2017 and lower G&A from the sale of Trans Mountain.","Interest expense was $6 million higher driven by higher short-term interest rates, which more than offsets benefit we received from having a lower debt balance, as well as interest income earned on the Trans Mountain sale proceeds. First stock dividends were down in the quarter due to the conversion of our mandatory convertible securities occurred in October. Cash taxes were lower by $1 million, driven by higher state tax refund. Sustaining capital was $9 million higher versus 2017. Our natural gas product segment was partially offset by lower sustaining capital for the sale of Trans Mountain. That was consistent with what we budgeted, we budgeted sustaining capital for 2018 would be higher than 2017 and are ending the year relatively close to plan except for the Trans Mountain sale.","Total DCF of $1.273 billion is up $83 million or 7%, driven by greater contributions from natural gas, lower G&A expenses and lower preferred stock dividend, partially offset by the sale of Trans Mountain and higher sustaining CapEx. DCF per share was up $0.56 per share, up $0.03 or 6%, same main drivers as DCF but with partial effect on the incremental shares from the conversion of our preferred stock. For the full year of 2018 versus 2017, DCF was up $248 million or 6% and DCF per share was $2.12 per share or $0.12 and 6% above 2017 compared to full year 2018. For the full-year relative to budget, DCF of $4.730 billion was up $163 million or 4% from our budget for the year, and our DCF per share of $2.12 was up $0.07 from our budget of $2.05 and 3% higher. So very nice performance for the full-year versus plan as well, especially considering the sale of Trans Mountain and had budgeted all the liquefaction of NGL differential we receive.","Now turning to the balance sheet, just like last quarter, you are going to see two net debt-to-EBITDA figures. The 4.4 times includes all of the Trans Mountain sale proceeds as we consolidated all of that cash from KML's balance sheet on to KMI. Including the cash, I would say to KML public shareholders on January 3rd, which is estimated at the end of the year of $890 million, our adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA was 4.5 times [indiscernible]. That 4.5 is a little bit better than last quarter of 4.6 with much improved year-end 2017 at 5.1, as well as the 5.1 we budgeted for the full year of 2018.","Obviously, Trans Mountain sales was the largest driver of that improvement, and proceeds have now been distributed to both KMI and to the public KML holders. We used a portion of our share to pay down a little more than $400 million that we had on our revolver and we've included most of the remainder of to fund a $1.3 billion bond maturity that\u2019s coming up here in February. Two largest changes on the balance sheet to note here are from year-end our cash and PP&E, and both of those are largely driven by the Trans Mountain sale. Net debt ended the quarter at $34.2 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion from year-end and a decrease of $400 million from last quarter, while reconcile of those in [Q3].","Quarter change, we had $1.27 billion in DCF, we spend $586 million in growth CapEx contributions to our joint ventures and dividend of $455 million we repurchased $23 million of shares, we had a growth capital source of $184 million, which is largely driven by tax refund we did in the quarter, approximately $400 million reduction for the quarter. For the full year, the $2.5 billion lower debt driven by $4.7 billion of our DCF, growth CapEx and JV contribution is $2.57 billion, $1.6 billion of dividends, $273 million of share repurchases. But the divestiture of proceeds mostly because of Trans Mountain at $3.4 billion less the KML public shareholders' portion of those proceeds of $890 million and then we had a working capital use of $300 million, which was largely driven by our late refund payments that we have reconciled to $2.5 billion lower [debt].","And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay, now we're going to turn to KML and Dax Sanders will give you the updates.","Dax Sanders","Thanks Steve. Before I get into the results, I do want to update you on a few general items. First as in the release mentioned, we made the promised return of capital distribution associated with Trans Mountain sale on January 3rd. More specifically, we distributed almost $1.2 billion to KML restricted voting shareholders for approximately $11.40 a share. We also completed a 3:1 reverse stock split that was approved at the shareholders' meeting last November.","With respect to the sale of Trans Mountain, you will recall that the agreement calls for a customary final working capital adjustment. We are substantially through that process and the review of the calculation with the Government of Canada, and believe that the final adjustment will result in us making a final cash payment back to the Government of approximately $35 million in the first quarter and as such, we have booked this amount. This adjustment should not be viewed as a lowering of the purchase price or an otherwise change to the economics of the deal rather it simply reflects that at closing we deliver less cash to the government than was contemplated. Consequently, and as I'll walk you through in a minute, this will not have an impact on the previously communicated net cash and net debt position of KML.","Moving to the business front, this is the first quarter where baseline was essentially in-service for the entire quarter and it contributed nicely to the portfolio. As of the end of the year, we have spent approximately $348 million of our share with just over $8 million remaining with the total project spend with our share of $357 million. The $357 million compares to the original estimate of $398 million and as I have mentioned previously, it is a result of cost savings on the project.","Finally, a topic that I know is on everybody's mind is KML's ongoing strategic review. While we don't have anything to announce since the review is ongoing, we are hopeful that we will have the review completed in direction to announce by the next earnings call. While this review is taking some time, the time we are taking is necessary given the range of options and cross border complexity, the fact that a strategic combination or sale of the company are among the options and the evaluation of those options require third-party price and term discovery and that process takes time.","Now moving towards the results and of note, as I talk to the results, I'm generally only going to reference results of continuing operations as we believe those are much more useful and relevant. Today, the KML Board declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of 0.1625 per a split adjusted restricted voting share of $0.65 annualized, which is consistent with previous guidance. Earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of '18 are $0.30 and that is derived from approximately $40 million of income from income continuing operations, which is up approximately $22 million versus the same quarter in 2017. The biggest contributors to the increase are strong revenue associated with baseline tank and terminal coming online and interest income associated with proceeds from the Trans Mountain sale.","I do want to offer one comment on the almost $28 million loss of discontinued ops, that is due almost entirely to the $35 million payment on Trans Mountain that I mentioned. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations, which exclude certain items, were approximately $43 million compared to approximately $18 million from the same quarter in 2017. Total DCF from continuing operations for the quarter is $62.9 million, which is up $28.7 million from the comparable period in 2017. That provides coverage of approximately $13 million and reflects a DCF payout ratio of approximately 31%, which is obviously somewhat skewed from the interest income.","Looking at components of the DCF variance, segment EBITDA before certain items is up $9.9 million compared to Q4 '17 with the pipeline segment up approximately $6.1 million and the terminal segment up approximately $3.8 million. The pipeline segment was higher primarily due to the recognition of efficiency revenue on Cochin and the non-recurrence of an inline inspection done in Q4 2017. The terminal segment was higher due primarily to Base Line coming on line as the asset was not in service in 2017 and higher contract renewals rates at the North 40, partially offset by the expiration of the contract on the Imperial JV and the onetime nature of the capital true up via the same asset in 2017.","G&A is essentially flat. Interest is favorable by approximately $24.7 million due to the interest on the Trans Mountain proceeds and lower interest expense. The cash tax line item was essentially flat. Preferred dividends were up $2.6 million given Q4 2018 had both projects outstanding for the fourth quarter [indiscernible]. Sustained capital was unfavorable approximately $3.6 million compared to Q4 '17 due to timing and support on both Cochin and within the Terminal segment. Looking forward to 2019, as with last year, I'll walk you through the details of KMLs budget at the analyst conference next week.","With that, I'll move onto the balance sheet comparing year-end 2017 to 12\/31\/18 and my comments will focus only on the line items related to the retained assets and not the assets or liabilities held for sale. Cash increased approximately $4.227 billion to $4.338 billion, and as I mentioned last quarter, there is a lot of moving pieces and the change associated with Trans Mountain stem from the CapEx spend on behalf of government, the government credit facility and other purchase price adjustments such that I\u2019m not going to take you through all on this call. But if you want more details, feel free to give us a call. Generally, the increase is the proceeds received from Trans Mountain plus DCF generated less expansion capital, less distributions paid net of growth and less the payoff of the debt we had when we received the sale proceeds.","More importantly, let me take you through the pro forma reconciliation of what that year-end cash balance looks like, taking into account immediate uses of the Trans Mountain proceeds following year-end. Starting with the $4.338 billion in cash, approximately $3.977 billion is paid out with special distribution on January 3rd that\u2019s the sum of the 1.195 distribution payables to restricted voting shareholders and the 2.782 billion distributions payable to KMI, both shown on the balance sheet. That\u2019s approximately $308 million of cash taxes from the gain on the sale will be paid in Q1. Finally, you deduct the $35 million final adjustment back to Canada that I have mentioned. Getting all those items leaves you with the net cash position obviously with no debt of approximately $18 million. This is consistent with the comments we have previously about KMI having little or no net debt after taking into account all the moving pieces associated with Trans Mountain sale on associated distributions.","Other current assets increased approximately $2 million due to an increase in AR associated with Base Line coming online, transition services agreement billing from Trans Mountain and interest receivable from interest on the Trans Mountain proceeds. Net PP&E decreased by $7 million as a result of depreciation in excess of net assets placed in service. Deferred charges on other assets decreased to approximately $63 million as a result of write off of the unamortized debt issuance cost associated with Trans Mountain facility that we canceled.","Moving on to the right hand side of the balance sheet, as I mentioned, distributions payable and distributions payable to related parties increased 0 to 1.2 and 2.8 billion respectively as reflected with special distribution. Other current liabilities increased $337 million, primarily due to taxes payable on the Trans Mountain sale. Other long-term liabilities decreased by $283 million, primarily as a result of the deferred tax liability release as a result of the gain on Trans Mountain sale.","And with that, I will turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","Okay, thanks Dax. We want to take a moment to honor our late General Counsel, Curt Moffatt, who passed away on December 28 while skiing with his family. In addition to being a fine lawyer, Curt was a fine human being and deep personal connections with the people he worked with. We lost a trusted colleague, but many at Kinder Morgan also lost a friend and a mentor. Curt loved this work and his heart shown through with it. We'll miss him.","Okay. With that, Tim, if you will come back on, we will take questions. Like we did last time, as a courtesy to everyone who has questions, we ask that you ask one question -- that you hold yourself to one question and one follow up. And if you have more questions, we will get to them. You just get back in the queue and we will take you up in due course. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just want to start off here on the CO2 segment and taking in account some of the volatility we've seen in commodity prices here. Just wondering how of the $5.7 billion in the backlog relates to the CO2 segment. And does the commodity price environment impact I guess the pace or how you think about that spend given this volatility?","Steve Kean","So in the CO2 segment, we got about $1.6 billion of backlog and we'll go through this in more detail on the conference. And yes, CO2 and also in our gathering and processing business, we will get CapEx on an ongoing basis. So we take into account commodity prices and obviously the breakeven economics with the return for the projects that we look at. So we typically will have ins and outs in both of those segments. And obviously, if commodity prices are lower they tend to be out. So the main topic there is Tall Cotton and we will continue to evaluate Tall Cotton, and whether we make substantial additional investments in there and the year goes on.","Jeremy Tonet","And just want to touch on SG&A, and it just seem down 40%, $67 million here year-over-year. It seems like a big step down, and it seems like some of that\u2019s relate to growth CapEx and capitalization there. But just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on that? And is this a new run rate or is the run rate something lower, or any more color you could provide would be helpful? Thanks.","Steve Kean","That\u2019s right, a good bit of it does relate to capitalization. But David, do you want to go through that?","David Michels","About half of it is capitalization. We had greater burnable capital spend in the year of about $300 million relative to the prior year we put a reasonable capitalization rate on that and would get to around $30 million of greater capital SG&A cost. So a lot of that was driven by GCX, which is a pretty major project, Elba liquefaction spend. And so we had a couple of major projects as a percentage here as well as all of our ongoing projects as well. And then a big chunk of that also was one time G&A cost that we had in 2017 and it was really is a result of an internal policy change, which allows more paid time off to be carried over to the subsequent year and then of course we had lower G&A cost in 2018 as we go from Trans Mountain.","Jeremy Tonet","So 130 is more of a real run rate G&A going forward the way to think about it?","David Michels","Well, depending on the capital -- the level of the capital spend, [indiscernible]\u2026","Kim Dang","And we'll show you our G&A budget for 2019 at the conference next week.","Jeremy Tonet","And just my first question just to confirm real quick, 1.6 CO2 is of that 5.7, that's the right way to think about that for the backlog?","Steve Kean","And almost all of the remainder is in natural gas.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Colton Bean ","So you mentioned the improved results there in the Permian network. Is that primarily a result of throughput, or are you still seeing some further increases in negotiated rates? And I guess just as a follow-on to that when you bring GCX in the service later this year. Is there any potential for rate improvement on maybe the Tejas network there in South Texas?","Steve Kean","Yes, so I guess first part of the question, yes, it is improvement in ultimately the rates that come-up for renewal. And I think on the second part just as more gas comes into the State of Texas dispersing that across our network, both for domestic consumption and export demand. I think there are some opportunities, which create so many contracts that have renewal options.","Colton Bean ","Then I guess just on the proposed joint venture with Enbridge and Oiltanking for the coal terminal. Just any thoughts as to how that project integrates with the existing footprint and whether there might be some ancillary opportunities if you were to reach FID there?","Steve Kean","So additionally, there is not integration the initial size that we would expect. And again, this is not in our backlog, this is something that we are working on with our partners and we're in development on. And before we would put it in our backlog, we would need to see substantial commitments from shippers. In the early part of the project, we would -- the first bill, we wouldn\u2019t expect to necessarily see it but we could add connectivity in larger bills to KMCC.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","My first question is on BHP with a little uptick in capacity the 100 million. I was under the impression that you already capped out in terms of MAOB. What were you able to do to get this incremental 100 million squeezed out, and can you do the same things at GCX?","Steve Kean","Well, when we ordered compression, we upsized the compression order. So it was a long lead time item and we though there is market for it if we can squeeze some more out. And so we ordered a larger compression with the large capacity compression equipment. And GCX will look for little pockets here and there, but I would say tapped out there.","Danilo Juvane","And my second question is sticking on the pipes, obviously, what's happening with PG&E in California will be yet to come up with respect to having I think -- and we understand the [$5 million] of contracts. How should we think about that? Has the potential for bankruptcy unfolds there? Are those contracts tied to assets that are base load and month to month, how are you guys thinking about that process...","Steve Kean","I think there's some -- there's always uncertainty in a bankruptcy proceeding, but I think there's some cause for optimism. Let me first -- around the Ruby contracts in particular, let me first start out by pointing out that it is Ruby specifically and exclusively that would be impacted by the potential of PG&E bankruptcy, so two contracts. One of those contracts serves the electric generations that PG&E uses to obviously generate power and service load. The other provides service to PG&E's gas distribution business. So we view both of those as core -- or contracts that are core to PG&E's business. So those two contracts together represent about $93 million a year of demand revenue. So it is a material matter to our interest in Ruby.","Again, while the bankruptcy process is uncertain there's important facts. One is what I said that they serve PG&E's core business. These contracts are used by PG&E and we've been told to expect continued utilization of those contracts. These contracts help PG&E meeting its service obligation to core customers. The contracts were approved by the CPUC when they are entered into. The CPUC does require PG&E to maintain upstream firm transport capacity. And so those reliability aspects we think help improve the chances of affirmation. Again, process is uncertain. And I'd also say those reliability aspects were confirmed recently with the GTN outage and diminished capacity there, which caused an increase it takes on the Ruby contracts.","So even though the current basis is lower and below the long-term contract rate, there are reliability benefits to be considered. And finally, it's our understanding at least that prior -- PG&E's prior bankruptcy proceeding, they did not reject firm transport contracts. So that's not proof of what they'll do this time, but we think there are reasons for optimism with these contracts.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","Just want to start off with 2019 CapEx guidance. Looks like cash flows should fund the majority of that and dividends, but looks like I think back into number about $400 million hole to make up somewhere else. Should the remaining CapEx -- should the assumption be that basically funded with debt at this point, or could we see some non-core asset sale there?","Steve Kean","Those are not really linked we would look at those individually. But at these numbers, there would be an expectation of some small debt financing. So we would be financing more than all of the equity requirement as a substantial portion of the debt requirement for those capital investments. And again we'll take you through that in next week's conference.","Kim Dang","And there's plenty of availability on our revolver.","Spiro Dounis","And then just wanted to touch base again on the Bakken, on your latest thoughts around expanding Double H, now that the projects have been announced, I think there's 300,000 barrel a day open season on the Express Liberty pipeline announced 350,000 barrels in season two, so call it, 650,000 needs to get down to during this somehow if both of these go through. Just curious what that means for Double H here?","Steve Kean","Yes, that\u2019s something that we are actively looking at. Volumes continue to grow and we continue to work on solutions for our customers to get them through Cushing. And there is some expansion capability on Double H.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer","First, just a follow up on Ruby. How should we think about the indemnification agreement that\u2019s in place from KMI on 50% of Ruby's debt? And then just to clarify Steve, have you even talked since the recent bankruptcy headline, or is that you should continue to expect utilization of those gas supply contracts?","Steve Kean","First, the indemnification no longer exists. And second, we are in pretty continuous conversations with our customers.","Harry Mateer","And then David, you mentioned the KMI plans to pay down the February maturities. So I know the Analyst Day is next week. But can you just give us a sense for how you are planning to manage the timing and\/or magnitude of new debt issuance for the balance of the year? Or should we just assume late in 2019 given the bond maturity that comes due in December?","David Michels","We will provide more on that during the Analyst Day, but no near term needs because of the cash we have on hand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust.","Tristan Richardson","Just curious on the projects added to the natural gas backlog in 4Q. Could you give us some highlights there where that is either geographically or around the chain, whether it'd be midstream or transmission in general regions?","Dax Sanders","So it's probably half midstream, which part of that is on our intrastate system other on the GMP side, and the other half I would say is supporting the LNG projects yet to come.","Tristan Richardson","And then just a quick follow up and you talked about the following up on previous question on the Bakken, the volume growth you saw there. And seems like utilization today and whether or not there is further headroom for growth on the existing asset base or the potential for expansion would require capital?","Dax Sanders","So we are investing in our gathering assets in the Bakken, because they are constrained. And so we have investments to expand our takeaway capability there gas and crude. To get more out of Double H, we would have to expand it. We would have to invest capital in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Dennis Coleman","Couple of questions, one if I could go back first to the KML strategic review, maybe this is reading a little bit too much into what I'm hearing. But Dax seemed like you emphasized that the options you listed were just among the options that are available. And I wonder if you might talk about what you mean by that or what other options we should be thinking about?","Dax Sanders","I think the options that are table are all the ones that we've articulated before. KML has good set of assets that can continue as the going concern. It could be one of the strategic transactions that I talked about. It could come back to KMI. So, I think all of the options that there is not anything new that we have previously spoken about. And I think we\u2019re going to be very through in thinking about every single one of those and which one makes the most sense.","Dennis Coleman","Okay, that\u2019s what I -- there is nothing new there that hasn\u2019t been. And then I guess just to dig a little bit deeper on the terminals decline, I understand the Edmonton Terminal. But the other thing that\u2019s talked about in the releases is the New York Harbor issues. I wonder if you might just expand upon that a little bit. And is it a one-time thing, is it season, or is there some impact on the business that is more permanent?","Dax Sanders","It's the same issue that brought up last time, it's Staten Island. We\u2019re roughly 60% utilized there. We've done a great job over the last two quarters of getting our head back above water but we\u2019re looking at strategic alternatives for the site at this point. And we're hoping that we'll have clarity on that in Q2 and we'll be able to indicate it on the next earnings call.","Kim Dang","But the reason that Staten Island is uniquely impacted is because there [indiscernible] and access\u2026","Steve Kean","13.75% on every barrel that goes through there, which makes it -- renders it uncompetitive with New Jersey terminals, our will be two of them\u2026","Operator","Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Is the government shut down having any impact on your actions with FERC, either the federal LNG process or on the pipeline permitting and approval side?","Steve Kean","No, FERC is funded and so the answer there is no. I mean, I think this is separate question about how a deadlocked commission will operate on certain things. But the answer is no. And more broadly, Jean Ann, the government shutdown is not having really much of any impact on it right now. In time with U.S. commission wild life not funded, it could have some impact on permitting but nothing that\u2019s constraining its critical path, nothing that\u2019s on a critical path currently. It's not having much of an impact on us at this point.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And then another question, it seems like there is some debate about whether Permian gas pipeline have good returns. You have a slide in your appendix of the last Investor Day, which shows a multiple in line with or better than your average, but I think some others that proposed the projects have said that mix of returns in duration didn\u2019t meet their bar. Can you just clarity the Permian gas pipe projects that you're working on in line with your backlog average? And are you comfortable with the duration of the projects and just any other color?","David Michels","We\u2019re getting these projects under contract at attractive returns with long-term contracts. And so they're good double-digits unlevered after tax returns and if not a 15% unlevered after tax return but there are good solid returns. And I agree with the observation just generally, I mean we looked at other opportunities out in the Permian crude and otherwise and we haven\u2019t been able to find the return levels that we would require to participate in that. But we're satisfied with the returns and their in-line returns on our gas transportation expansion projects out of the Permian.","Steve Kean","This does have with what we said again in the call, which is we are using a disciplined approach as to how we allocate our capital. So we are not chasing deals that don\u2019t make the bottom sense for Kinder Morgan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Catellier with CIBC Capital Markets.","Robert Catellier","I just wanted to ask what is the impact on operations from the production curtailments in Alberta?","Steve Kean","The contracts that we have are take or pay there and then they're monthly warehousing charge so we have not seen an impact.","Robert Catellier","But you're not -- I understand that take or pay wouldn\u2019t see an impact there. But operationally, are you seeing anything any different\u2026","Steve Kean","No, we actually in our Alberta crude terminal, we had record volumes in the fourth quarter. We have been averaging 77,000 a day. We had 146 in the fourth quarter and in December we were up to 168 and hitting all time one day high of 265. So volumes have been very strong. Now, we have seen it fall off a little bit in January as we would have expected but it had no impact on the bottom line.","Robert Catellier ","And then if I could the net interest impact on the Trans Mountain sales proceeds that impact on the DCF for KML. What I'm trying to extract is the interest income specifically related to the proceeds versus other interest expense you might have?","Steve Kean","Yes, I think you can assume we had what we paid-back for the quarter, we didn\u2019t have any debt drawn during the quarter for KML.","Kim Dang","No, it's how much of interest income or is it with DCF\u2026","Steve Kean","So I think it's the 24.7, it's the full amount there. So I am saying that total amount, we didn\u2019t have any amounts during that piece, so the full amount is the\u2026","Robert Catellier ","And that's for pretax or post tax amount, 24.7\u2026","Steve Kean","That\u2019s [pretax] amount\u2026","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Can you quantify what the impact on volumes being move towards Mexico was that in your system either for the quarter or for the full-year?","Steve Kean","Impact on volumes moved to Mexico\u2026","Michael Lapides ","Yes, or volumes directed to Mexico through your system. I'm just trying to get a gauge of whether your system is seeing a material benefit yet and if not now when?","Kim Dang","So we moved 73 million cubic feet a day incremental to Mexico on our system during the fourth quarter versus the fourth quarter of '17.","Michael Lapides ","So it's relatively small relative in the grand scheme of things?","Kim Dang","That's incremental\u2026","Steve Kean","We're in excess of 3 bcf a day on average.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","I guess following on the question -- the last question. I just want to ask about export trends you are seeing on the refined product side. It looks with rush of articles recently about growing gas prices to Mexico with efforts where government cracks down on pipeline sub. So curious if at all how that's impacting you and how that seems might be responding.","Steve Kean","We had record volumes on the ship channel from an export standpoint. We were up almost 8.5% from a volumetric standpoint over our ship docks and 10.1 on total volume so very, very strong movement on the gasoline and diesel over our docks. In Houston alone, gasoline was up 8% and distillates were up 6%.","Chris Sighinolfi","Those figures, are those 4Q numbers you're reporting or are those full year?","Steve Kean","Full year numbers\u2026","Chris Sighinolfi","And has that changed in August, we're very early in the New Year but it seems like a lot of this has escalated once the calendar turns. Just curious if the conditions there have altered in any way.","Steve Kean","No, the only thing we've seen a little more of is we're seeing more volume move via rail out of our former crude by rail facility, which is now been repurposed to handle gasoline and distillates and that's starting to ramp up, and that\u2019s all Mexico.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Beck with Citigroup.","Eric Beck","Just a quick one from me, in the CO2 segment, the mid-cush differential that you have to hedge mostly for 2019. Are those levels fairly similar to what we saw in fourth quarter?","Kim Dang","It's roughly $8 a barrel.","Eric Beck","And just one quick follow-up, regarding the acquisition of the [indiscernible] Field. Are you looking to potentially do additional acquisitions of this type going forward, or might that depend on how you see Tall Cotton develop over time?","Steve Kean","That was a bit unique given its relationship to our SACROC field and our ability to use that field for multiple purposes. Meaning it produces oil and NGL, but also the CO2 that it uses could be perhaps better used elsewhere in our portfolio and perhaps offsetting capital investments that we might make in order to expand CO2 production. So I would call it somewhat unique, but it's an example of the things that we look out for and things that -- and that integrate well with our existing operations.","Operator","Our next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Two questions, one given that you're in settlement discussions on EPNG and pre-settlement on Tennessee. Any change to the guidance you've given for roughly $100 million impact over time and no impact in '19?","Steve Kean","No change -- yes, we're early in those discussions. We're encouraged to be engaged on those two systems but we don't have any update in our guidance or outlook there. I think the $100 million is still good from our perspective, it reflects the tax only component of that. And we'll just have to see where the discussions come out. But we prefer this environment, we've traditionally been able to work things out with our customers and we would rather be doing it here than in a FERC process, so we're happy to be engaged on both of those systems.","Becca Followill","And then back to Ruby, can you remind us of the structure there? I think Pembina has a preferred and so that carves off a big chunk of the EBITDA. So if by chance PG&E were to abrogate or to re-cut that contract. Would that disproportionally hit KMI?","Steve Kean","It would disproportionally hit KMI. And you're correct, Pembina's interest is the preferred and that\u2019s why as I said, it is a material matter to our interest and Ruby. But as I also said, we think that there is reason to be optimistic about these contracts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane","Couple of quick follow-up questions for me, firstly on KML. Are there any major second points that may cause a potential slippage beyond the next earnings call?","Steve Kean","There is always a potential for that. But I think we feel like we will be able to give you an update at the next earnings call.","David Michels","Yes, I think that\u2019s right. That's our estimated time. It takes on and we feel like we will have an answer about that one.","Danilo Juvane","And as a follow up to Jean Ann's question on the Permian pipeline returns. The 6 times multiples that you have outlined before. Is that over the course of the 10 year contract duration?","Steve Kean","Yes, what that is showing, I think we stated the same way and all these are 6 times the second year in EBITDA multiple, and the contracts -- the underlying contracts are for 10 years. And when we make the decision of the project investment, we are careful to look at a variety of terminal value assumptions to make sure that we are satisfied with returns that we are getting on our capital in a variety of scenarios.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Just a quick little follow up, I want to touch base in Elba here. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more and the drivers to the delay. And I think it was during first quarter you said before now end of first quarter, you guys feel comfortable with the timeline. Or what's happened there exactly?","Steve Kean","Yes, so the delay continues to be associated with contractor productivity. We are obviously getting into the final days here. We have people on the ground watching the progress that we are making. We are in commissioning activity simultaneous with the completion of the project. And so we think end of Q1 is a good and reasonable estimate for when it will be compete. There is obviously a band of uncertainty around that date, but we think we are closing in on it here.","Operator","At this time, I'm showing no further questions.","Steve Kean","Great. Well, thank you all very much for spending time with us, and we will see most of you next week at the Investor Day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"12303":["Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE:KMI) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 16, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","Rich Kinder - Chairman and CEO","Steve Kean - President and COO","Kim Dang - CFO and VP","Tom Martin - President, Natural Gas Pipelines","Jim Wuerth - President, CO2","Ron McClain - President, Products Pipelines","Analysts","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Welcome to the Kinder Morgan Quarterly Earnings Conference. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer portion. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to your host to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin, sir.","Rich Kinder","Okay. Thank you, Holly. As usual we\u2019ll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We will be referring to Kinder Morgan, Inc., as KMI, to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners as KMP and to El Paso Pipeline Partners as EPB. And we\u2019ll cover all three.","Let me kick it off by saying we had a very good quarter and we are on-track for a very good year. We expect all three of our entities to meet or exceed the distribution or dividend targets that they have for the full year.","I am going to mention just a few significant matters before turning the presentation over to Steve Kean our Chief Operating Officer, who will talk about the specific performance of our business units and also about our backlog and then Kim Dang our Chief Financial Officer, who will go through the details of the financial results for the first quarter.","Let me start just with the high view of our operating performance, three or four things come to mind, we had extraordinary gas throughput during the first quarter and we moved what we think as an all time record for us 33 Bcf a day during the month of January on average. And that\u2019s about 33% about a third of all the natural gas consumed in the United States during that month.","In our refined products group, we actually had a pretty nice increase in refined product volumes. We\u2019re actually have up 5.3%, if you count our Parkway project, I think it\u2019s fair to script that out, script that out with 3.7% in refined product volumes, and that\u2019s versus our estimate from the EIA of 1.1% across all of United States.","Over in our CO2 segment we had another very nice quarter, our SACROC unit where the oil production increased by 4%, lifting the overall oil volumes in our CO2 segment, allowed it to be up by 5% overall and on a debt basis net to our share up 7%. But I think SACROC is a more meaningful number because we did have some improvement in some of our newer startup projects also.","In our terminals we had a very nice increase in earning for DD&A driven by both new projects coming online and organic growth, as well as the Tanker and APT acquisition which was closed in January of this year. On the business development front, we had an outstanding quarter. Steve will discuss the project backlog which increased by 1.6 billion during the quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we put 800 million out of the backlog into service during the quarter. So we really generated $2.4 billion worth of new backlog projects and most of the increase came in the natural gas business segment.","Now, as you look across Kinder Morgan, we like to think that there are many opportunities to grow business across all of our business segments, but if you look back a couple of years to when we made the El Paso acquisition, that represent a huge investment on our part based on the future use of natural gas in United States, not the price of natural gas, but the supply demand equation for natural gas. And we felt at that time there was going to be a tremendous need for capacity to transport natural gas around the country as both the demand and supply side grew. And it represents an enormous long-term upside for all three of the Kinder Morgan companies, so I thought I would just spend a little time sketching out for you my view of the national market and the significant recent impact on our pipelines in terms of new long-term agreements with customers to utilize our system.","Some of you may have seen that Wood Mackenzie just put out its spring 2014 preliminary outlook. In that outlook for natural gas supply and demand they estimate that demand this year in the United States will be 71.5 Bcf a day. And they projected by 2024 in 10 years that demand will escalate to 94.5 Bcf a day or an increase of 23 Bcf a day. And we would do that as a real understatement because the way Wood Mac computes it, say actually have the increase in Mexico, exports from Mexico as a deduct on the supply side rev, but a increase on the demand side, so really this 23 Bcf a day potential increase in our view is a little bit understated.","That\u2019s coming from a number of sources, all of which we\u2019ve discussed before, but it\u2019s LNG exports additional electric generation fueled by natural gas, an increase in industrial use and then an increase in exports to Mexico. All of these we think bode very well for a national pipeline network like us. A couple of other facts that have come out very recently that I think that are also important from a national basis is that, you may have seen the recent article that we now have $70 billion of announced U.S. petrochemical development almost the great bulk of it along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana where we have a tremendous pipeline network.","And they have also seen just in the last couple of days the estimate for May, Marcellus Utica production at approaching 15 Bcf for the month of May 2014, the same Wood Mac study that I referred to on the supply side sees that increasing to 28.5 Bcf in 2024, our net increase of about 13 Bcf a day. Some of these are pretty much mind boggling figures, another is that EGA recently commissioned ICF to do a survey of infrastructure needs over the next 20 years, they projected that infrastructure needs would require $641 billion of investment between now and 2035, an average of about $30 billion a year, now not all of this is natural gas it is overall infrastructure. But the relevant thing I think is that that\u2019s versus an \u201911 estimate that EGA had done which turned out to be $10 billion a year, a tripling of potential investment. All of these facts I think are very relevant to saying that we are at the beginning of what we view as a tremendous upswing in the need for natural gas transportation in the United States.","Now you would expect us as the largest owner, operator of natural gas pipelines to benefit from these nationwide trends, but the real issue that you all consider is are we benefiting and what specific examples do we have to talk about that show Kinder Morgan is benefiting. Let me give you some numbers, since December of \u201913 we have executed long-term binding contracts with an average life of approximately 15 years or about 2.8 Bcf a day. And these binding contracts over 1.4 Bcf a day is on our Tennessee system and about 800 million a day is on our El Paso natural gas system in the West.","In addition to that we have executed a long-term contract to supply still another Gulf Coast LNG terminal with volumes estimated 700 million a day, contingent on final FERC approval of project, and we had three very successful non-binding open seasons, one on NGPL to move gas from the REX interconnect in Illinois with NGPL to the Gulf Coast, and two on our Tennessee system for Northeast capacity, all three of these open seasons were vastly oversubscribed and we\u2019re now working to advance those projects. Again I want to emphasize those were non-binding open seasons, but the results we received were very encouraging and very positive.","I think two points come home very clear and very important. The first is that Tennessee is now on its way to becoming a bifurcated system with gas moving from the Marcellus Utica to the Northeast and also from the Marcellus Utica to the Southeast and the Gulf Coast. And this will only increase as the production in Appalachia increases. Secondly EPNG is filling its previously underutilized south line largely with exports to Mexico and will be expanding system later this decade to beat all the demand. All-in-all, we see all of these events and the national statistics for that matter as a very positive trend that will drive growth at Kinder Morgan in the years to come.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Kean","Thanks Rich. I am going to give an update on the backlog and then I\u2019ll go through the segments quickly. So starting with our January Investor Meeting last year we\u2019ve been giving -- we gave out our backlog and we\u2019ve been updating that pretty much every quarter since then. As Rich mentioned we went 14.8 billion to 16.2 billion across all of the processes on a combined basis. So we added this 1.6 billion in the backlog also putting into service over $800 million in the projects.","Our project petitions grew, total backlog was offsetting of the process we put into service. On the larger projects we put into service where there is a $100 million KMP swinging lateral to serve the Phillips 66 Refinery there. Almost $500 million with the terminals group projects went in including phase one of our Edmonton internal expansion and expansion in our Pasadena Galena Park facility and some coal export facility expansions. We also had about $150 million of projects come into service in the CO2 segment during the quarter.","Now a reminder about the backlog, it consists of those projects that we view as highly probable, highly confident that would be done, not a guarantee but a very high probability. We actually expect to add to this and do more and invest more capital than what we have in the backlog, but unless we have a project that\u2019s highly probable we don\u2019t add. So here is the business unit composition, the gas group is up from 2.7 billion to 4.1 billion that 1.4 billion is by far the biggest increase across the business units.","Here the biggest additions were the $780 million expansion for Antero to increase south bound EPB capacity the Utica and Marcellus. This demonstrates again the strong demand for additional capacity and comes on the heels of an oversubscribed, open season for that same path that we had in December. Second we\u2019ve got firm contracts supporting a $500 million plus expansion on the EPNG system, so it\u2019s not just Marcellus and Utica we\u2019re seeing strength and demand for transport capacity in the other parts of network too. The third big contributor to the increase is the expanded scope in our liquefaction project and associated facilities at Elba Island, bringing the total to our share to 1.2 billion. That\u2019s an EPB investment. And overall EPB was up about 200 million from quarter-to-quarter historically.","The products group backlog is down from $1.1 billion to $1 billion, and that\u2019s due primarily to the Sweeny Lateral going into service. I want to point out here, we have a $300 million plus project the UTOPIA Utica and Ontario pipeline the NGL line which we have an LOI on. We view it as pretty probable, hope to and expect to firm that up and put it in the backlog shortly. But it\u2019s not currently in the backlog.","The terminals portion of the backlog is down 300 million from 2.3 to 2. We added about $200 million with the projects in the internal sector. But as I mentioned, they had almost 0.5 billion going to service during the quarter. We continue to see really good growth opportunities in this sector. We\u2019re rapidly expanding our Edmonton position by about 50%, our Houston Ship Channel position by about 26% to just under 40 million barrels of capacity. We\u2019re also in the very early days of growth in demand for midstream infrastructure that we expect our Company to massive build out of new chemical facilities primarily along the Gulf Coast.","The backlog in our CO2 business is up 600 million, S&T is essentially flat at 1.8 million, but the enhanced oil recovery part of our backlog is up to 2.1 billion, a $600 million increase, and that\u2019s primarily our ROS or residual oils on new development projects. So we continue to see strong demand for CO2 and plenty of places to put it to use and see that our projects are out there. And the bigger project of course the last one Kinder Morgan Canada 5.4 billion TMX expansion which is unchanged since last update.","Now in the segment update I\u2019m just going to focus on how we came out for this quarter versus same quarter last year, and Kim will take you through the details on all the numbers. So for the Gas Group, earnings before DD&A we\u2019re up 226 million in KMP, 46%. So that\u2019s due to the Copel acquisitions which closed in May of last year and the dropdown of the remaining 50% of EPNG in El Paso midstream, which closed March 1. But if you strip those out, earnings before DD&A for the segment were still up $62 million.","And as Rich pointed out, we saw strong demand for transport capacity really across our systems. If you look at the volume on KMP, our transport volumes were up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. If you factor in the increase, year-over-year increase in storage results on the Texas intrastate which don\u2019t counts on those transport numbers that increase was 6.2%.","And on the 2.8 Bcf of sign-up, new capacity sign-ups that Rich mentioned, it\u2019s worthy of note that a quarter of that was on existing capacity. So we signed-up capacity, previously unsigned capacity, but not really requiring CapEx to get those deals done. So that\u2019s again showed I think the strength and demand for transport capacity, both new and existing. And actually if you take just one project, which had a very small amount of capital associated with it, it goes up to about a third, so a very good signs of increase in transport value that we\u2019re beginning to see.","On EPB asset earnings before DD&A were essentially flat up $2 million, there it\u2019s radiated impacts on S&G and where it\u2019s being offset by some positives on TIG and the express pipeline. And looking ahead we\u2019re very bullish on the opportunities presented by natural gas as the exports demand from electric generation and industrial users and the need to transport and process gas out of shale plays I think we\u2019re seeing customers really beginning to view again transport out as the value path.","In CO2 our segment earnings before DD&A were up 26 million or 7%. Higher CO2 oil volumes and higher CO2 oil and NGL prices the volumes are driven as Rich mentioned by SACROC being up almost 4% also Katz and Goldsmith with record CO2 volumes for the quarter driven by an 8% increase in Southwest Colorado volumes primarily due to Doe Canyon in California. We continue to pursuit several large development projects [indiscernible].","On products the segment earnings before DD&A were up 4 million or 2% increases in southeast terminal\u2019s advancements and Parkway offsetting year-over-year decreases at SFPP and Cochin. Cochin saw lower volumes at its origin point at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Also note as Rich mentioned is our refined products volumes are up as a good signs that doesn\u2019t take CapEx and you\u2019ve got refined product lines going up and some tariff escalations as well that\u2019s an overall positive. Looking forward, we continue to see really condensate and NGL driven growth in this sector with projects of our KMCC system at Eagle Ford and additions to our Cochin Reversal project in Utopia.","On terminals our segment earnings were up 41% -- $41 million or 6% from last year now 11 million of that is due to the acquisitions that both the Jones Act and two smaller acquisitions but the 26 million was organic growth and that\u2019s expansion projects. But also I think good pricing on our services we had $7 million improvement attributable to our Gulf Coast region alone associated with price escalations on our tanks or on better terms on renewal. Other highlights here we brought a phase 1 of our scale in the Houston Ship Channel, we brought on phase 1 of our Edmonton Terminal expansion as well. Also those who had expansions under contract before we even finished phase 1.","Kinder Morgan Canada finally, segment earnings before DD&A we\u2019re down 4 million primarily a result of the weaker Canadian dollar, but the main story here continues to be the progress on the expansion. We passed another milestone there. We filed the facilities application in December and we now have the scheduling order in hand. And long story short, it\u2019s going to be a full fair but finer process. We\u2019ve got a deadline of July 2nd of 2015 for the NEB order and kind of hard of compressors, we just got our first set of information requests and a primarily statement of condition. So things are moving along very well there.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kim Dang","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Turning to the numbers, first on KMP, today we are declaring the Board approved declared dividend at KMP of a $1.38, that\u2019s a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2013. And this is on the first page of numbers for KMP which is on the bottom of the GAAP income statement. On the GAAP income statement I\u2019ll point out that net income is down -- net income attributable to KMP is down $37 million, but this has all the certain items which we will outline for you on the next page. The largest one being $141 million gain on the sale of Express, that was a benefit in 2013 and obviously not recurring in 2014.","So going into the next page and looking at our calculation of distributable cash flow which is reconciled back to our GAAP net income. We\u2019ve produced Dcf per unit of a $1.55 for the quarter, comparing that to the $1.38 for our cleared distribution that is $76 million in excess coverage in the quarter, as we tell you almost every quarter we expect to have excess coverage in the first quarter, in the fourth quarter, and typically we will have negative coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter, and we will have excess coverage for the full year.","Right now, our excess coverage for the full year is nicely above our plan as a result of the new contracts that we\u2019ve signed on TGP and EPNG and also as a result of the APT acquisition, which is why you see us guiding to our guidance, which says we\u2019ll declare at least $5.58 per unit. On the $1.55 on a total basis, Dcf is $699 million that\u2019s $143 million increase or 26% increase over the quarter of 2013. Looking at what drives $143 million increase segment earnings before DD&A $1.569 billion that\u2019s up $293 million or 23%. Steve took you through pieces, but the biggest piece of the 293 million is 226 million increases in the natural gas segment and in CO2 and terminals also contributed nicely to the $293 million.","Versus our budget for the full year, we\u2019re expecting that we will exceed our budget for segment earnings before DD&A largely again as a result of the APT acquisition, on the contracts on TGP and EPNG. And then that\u2019s being slightly offset by the lower volumes on KMCC. Interest in the quarter was $149 million expense, that\u2019s $26 million increase versus the first quarter of 2013, sorry that\u2019s G&A, and that is G&A is above our budget for the quarter, and we expect it to be above our budget for the full year by about 2%. Interest $228 million expense in the quarter that\u2019s up $41 million versus last year largely on increases on balance associated with our expansion capital program.","For the quarter, we -- our interest is very close to the budget, and for the full year, we expect it to be close to our budget. Now you would think that interest would be higher than our budget because we issued incremental debt versus our budget of 500 million to finance about 50% of the APT acquisition. That higher balance is being offset by lower rate from what we budgeted and higher capitalized interest. Sustaining CapEx $24 million increase in the quarter, that is, we are right now behind our budget in terms of spending but that\u2019s going to be timing because for the full year we\u2019re expecting that sustaining CapEx will be slightly above our budget, probably about 2% or so.","As a result of the APT acquisition and then also some additional expenditure on the Texas intrastate, so $293 million coming from the segment increased expenses of 26 million on G&A, 41 on interest, $24 million increase on the sustaining CapEx and then you have the GP increase as a result of the increases in the distribution and the increase in units of 52 million, that gets you to $150 of the $143 million increase and then there is $7 million of small other items.","On the certain items for the quarter there were 34 million the largest piece was regal reserves and that was associated with two unfavorable decisions that we got in, two unfavorable court decisions. You also see there the insurance deductable in casualty losses, $8 million that\u2019s timing these are expenses that will be either reimbursed by customers as we rebuilt their assets or largely reimbursed by insurance. And then we have severance of $6 million and that is an item that will be paid by KMI and not be borne by KMP. So that gives you the main certain items for the quarter.","Looking at KMP\u2019s balance sheet, there\u2019s a $1.194 million increase in total assets and the APT acquisition is the biggest piece about at $960 million. We ended the quarter at $20.5 billion in debt and that results in debt-to-EBITDA about 3.8 times, we still expect that we will end the year at about 3.7 times which is consistent with our budget.","The 20.5 billion in debt is an increase of just $1 billion versus a 19.5 billion at the end of last year. It\u2019s actually $996 million. Just looking at the sources and uses that drive that, we have $1.76 billion in acquisitions expansion capital and contributions to equity investments, the largest feature of that is 960 or the largest pieces are 960 from the APT acquisition. And then we spent a little under 740 million on expansion CapEx.","We raised capital of 803 million through equity offerings and then we had a use of cash of working capital on other items of about a little over 40 which is primarily crude interest, it\u2019s the timing of when we make our interest payments. And then we had a, obviously $76 million of coverage is the biggest offset to the use of cash from a crude interest. So that is KMP balance sheet.","Turning to EPB, it is GAAP income statement and you can see there that we are declaring a cash distribution today of $0.65 which is an increase of 5% or $0.03 over the first quarter of 2013. Looking at EPB\u2019s calculation of distributable cash flow which is also reconciled to GAAP net income, Bcf per unit is $0.75 for the quarter comparing that to the $0.65 distribution, we\u2019ve get coverage of about $21 million in the quarter.","Similar story here on coverage we expect to have positive coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter. And we expect to have negative coverage in the second quarter and probably slightly negative coverage in the third quarter and for the full year we expect to have positive coverage and beyond our budget. Total Bcf $163 million is down 6 million or 4% versus last year. And just reconciling that $6 million for the year earnings before DD&A up $2 million versus last year\u2019s, Steve took you through the reasons for that.","G&A is flat. Interest expense is actually down meaning reduced expense versus last year of about $2 million and that is a result of maturing debt being replaced with lower rate debt. Sustaining CapEx is about a $1 million increase and expense versus last year. And then the GP is about a $7 million increase in expense associated with the higher distribution per unit and more units outstanding and then you had other items of about 2 million to get you to your total change in Dcf of $6 million.","Looking at EPB\u2019s balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter at 4.1 billion in debt which result in debt-to-EBITDA of 3.7 times and consistent with our budget we still expect to end the year at about four times debt-to-EBITDA at EPB. The 4.12 billion in debt at the end of March is a decrease of about 66 million from year-end and to reconcile that decrease for you, we had about $17 million in expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We\u2019ve raised equity of about 36 million and we had working capital and other items that were source of capital of about 47 million, the two biggest pieces of that being a source of working capital on a crude interest and then coverage was $21 million in the end of quarter.","Finally, turning to KMI, KMI we are declaring a dividend today of $0.42 that is $0.04 increase or 11% over the first quarter of 2013. Cash available per share is $0.55 which is a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2013 and $0.55 versus the $0.42 results in about $138 million of coverage. Similar to KMP and EPB we expect to have positive coverage at KMI in the first quarter and the fourth quarter negative in the second quarter and third and positive coverage for the full year. Right now we expect that our coverage will be slightly above our budget and that because we will be slightly our $1.78 billion in cash available to pay dividend, and thus you see the guidance in the press release to meet or exceed our cash available to pay dividends.","$573 million of cash available to pay dividends in the quarter it\u2019s about $60 million increase or a 12% increase versus the first quarter of last year. And just breaking that down the cash generated from KMP and EPB saw assessments in the two MLPs is up about 69 million as a result of the increase in the distributions at those MPLs and the increase in the unit count.","Cash generated from other assets is down about $11 million as a result of the dropdown to KMP in the first quarter of last year. G&A is reduced by about $2 billion versus last year, interest expense is reduced by about $6 million at $160 million of expense, and that\u2019s a result of the pay down in debt from the dropdown. And then cash taxes are higher by about 6 million to get you to your $60 million.","So we had a nice quarter at KMI, we are slightly ahead of our budget in terms of cash available to pay dividends, largely as a result of our performance by NGPL and SACROC and we expect most of that to carry through for the full year. Looking at KMI\u2019s balance sheet, KMI ended the quarter with just over $10 billion in debt and we still expect that we will in the year a debt-to-EBITDA at KMI on a fully consolidated basis at about 4.9 times.","Debt increased about $181 million in the quarter, just going through the sources and leases. Share repurchase was a use of cash of $94 million more repurchase was a use of cash of $55 million. We made a pension contribution for $50 million. We had payments in the legacy El Paso marketing book and on from environmental expenses of about $30 million and then cash available versus the cash actually received and there is a difference there of about $67 million, 22 on that for fact that we didn\u2019t sell the KMR units and in the balance is timing on cash distributions we received out of equity investments. And then we had a source of working capital of about $117 million from other items the largest piece of that is $138 million in coverage for the quarter.","And so with that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Rich.","Rich Kinder","Okay and Holly if we\u2019ll take any questions you may have, Holly if you\u2019ll come back on and give them their instructions. We\u2019ll go from there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Alright Brad how are you?","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Doing well Rich how are you?","Rich Kinder","Pretty good.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","A quick question on the Tennessee gas reversals, it seems like you guys have been able to line one of these major by directional or reversal projects up on TGP every few months. And it seems like your projects are generally able to go from planning to realization faster than a lot of the other pipelines in the Northeast. How many more potential reversals could we see out of TGP? And would the reversal or the potential reversal for the NGL Y grade pipeline down to the Gulf Coast impact how much of the pipeline could be used in a gas reversal?","Rich Kinder","Yes I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom Martin who runs our Natural gas pipeline group.","Tom Martin","Yes I think we certainly have the opportunity to look at more backhaul or south bound capacity, any other used capacity that we\u2019re creating for the NGL projects that ultimately if that doesn\u2019t go we could use do that for additional gas or as needed. We\u2019re also very excited about our results for the non-binding open season to take additional Marcellus gas ultimately into New England between those two projects we would see anywhere from 1 to 1.2 Bcf a day incremental volumes going into the New England market. So we think both from the demand that we\u2019re seeing southbound as well as the interest to go, to bring additional volumes into New England. We\u2019re very excited about our growth prospects going forward.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Great, thanks Tom and I guess just may be push a little bit harder on that on the northeast reversals. Are you -- is there a number we can think about in terms of potential additional reversals on TGP or is it difficult to give a precise number?","Tom Martin","Yes, I mean it all depends on what rates the market ultimately will bear, but I think all the -- relatively speaking the lower cost expansion projects have been done but I think we\u2019re continuing to see interest even at higher level, so it'd get hard to speculate on volumes but I think we\u2019re certainly talking to our customers every day and there is still interest for more capacity.","Rich Kinder","Yes I think that again Brad the key thing here is if you just look at these numbers, the numbers tell the story. Again, we expect across 15 Bcf of production this quarter up there. There is not nearly that much demand particularly this time of the year in the northeast. If you look at this ramping up in fact Wood Mackenzie would show it ramping up just in five years to 22.5 Bcf, so a ramp-up of 7 Bcf just in the next five years and those volumes have to go some place. And of course what we have is we have essentially it\u2019s a little bit of a simplification, essentially a pool of big lines that were originally tended to go south and north. Now we\u2019ve in essence reversing two of them on what we\u2019ve done so far. So there is more opportunity but Tom is right, the further you get the more expensive it gets and we\u2019ll just have to see are there people willing to pay freight. But obviously there is a tremendous need for more capacity to get natural gas as well as NGLs out of Marcellus Utica.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Great. And just one last one from me on the natural gas front, sounds like there is a lot of growth potential coming out of Mexican demand. And I would imagine given the fact that that country continues to import high cost LNG that that could be a real growth market. When we think about kind of how big that volume opportunity could get, are there limitations on the southern side of the border with Pemex\u2019s pipeline system or do you see quite a bit of running room to continue to expand exports south bound?","Rich Kinder","I think they will continue to expand their infrastructure south of the border. And the real test of that is when they sign-up for long-term contracts on our side of the border. So I think we believe that over the next 10 years demand will more than double from the present throughput that goes into Mexico today and the reason is very simple. They are converting electric generation at industrial use from oil to natural gas, the opening of the energy business in Mexico we believe will concentrate primarily on oil not on natural gas and the only alternative as we switch to natural gas is to import LNG which is very expensive and of course that led to I don\u2019t know all the details, but essentially the closing of the Altamira plant which I think was a mutually beneficial thing from both the Mexican importers and shale that could take that LNG and move it elsewhere. So cheaper a source of natural gas is clearly from Texas and the rest of the U.S I think you\u2019ll see some Rockies gas and in fact going into Mexico and of course EPNG is just -- again if you think about Tennessee being ideally positioned in the Marcellus Utica, EPNG is tremendously well situated for the exports to Mexico.","Tom Martin","Just one other point there, they are building out the infrastructure south of the border it\u2019s not dependent though on Pemex getting it done, so in Tennessee is or Tennessee\u2019s power plant developments that they\u2019re putting up, they are having private companies are coming into developed and build out the transportation capacity that\u2019s going to be acquired south of the border, you get it from our line basically to the power plant to the vehicle.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Great, and when we think about 800 million of demand on EPNG for those new contracts that you mentioned in the press release. Is it fair to assume that most if not all of that volume is coming from demand south of the border?","Rich Kinder","High percentage of it but there is some up [Multiple Speaker] and in addition to that there we think there will be significant additional opportunities. We think the 800 is just kind of a starter.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company","Great, thanks so much everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hey Darren, how are you doing?","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Fine, thanks Rich. Two quick questions from me, the first regarding that March announcement that you guys made of additional billion dollars of CO2 investments. If I\u2019m just thinking about that 700 million that\u2019s going to be focused on drilling wells and building out that fuel gathering infrastructure at St. Johns. Can you give us a sense of the average unlevered rate of return across that project set? And I\u2019m trying to think about it with regard to how that compares to the average unlevered IRRs on that 1.5 billion in EOR backlog CapEx that you outlined at the Analyst Day over the next five years?","Rich Kinder","Jim Wuerth?","Jim Wuerth","Yes, I think unlevered we\u2019re looking in the mid-teens on the pipe in the infrastructure there. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at as mid-teens.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay.","Rich Kinder","We\u2019re building a new pipe from St. Johns over to intersect with our Cortez system just South of Albuquerque.","Jim Wuerth","That\u2019s correct.","Rich Kinder","And overall, we think we will be in the mid to upper teens on the returns on that billion dollar investment.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Do you think Rich though that just based on the large upfront capital that you spent there that your incremental returns theoretically should get better?","Rich Kinder","Well it could, and it just depends on exactly how the contracts work out in the end.","Jim Wuerth","Obviously, if you look at McElmo Dome 30 years ago when Shell and Mobil operated it, they had to make a decision to put in the Cortez pipeline. It\u2019s very expensive when you put that first build-in and the numbers don\u2019t look that great, in today\u2019s world it looks like a great investment. We\u2019ve had it now for close to 14 years and the volumes just continue to go up without not a lot of infrastructure being added on the pipe, so I think you\u2019ll see the same thing within St. John\u2019s and the Lobos pipeline.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Okay. And then last question for me, Steve. Back to the products by segment and that growth in cash flow that you talked about, as we\u2019re thinking about the backend of this year and into the first half of 2015, can you give us an update on KMCC capacity utilization? I know that we talked last time you said it was about two-thirds book but obviously, there is this -- there is big supply growth of south Texas condensate that\u2019s moving east. So I\u2019m wondering from your perspective how you think about if you do changing the scale or scope of that 1.8 billion of capital that you\u2019re going to spend across the ship channel? So maybe some additional ship docks at Colina or more interconnects between Galena and Pasadena. It seems like there is a lot of opportunity and you could spend more money, so I\u2019d love you thoughts there.","Steve Kean","I know you\u2019re right. And capacity utilization tends to be -- is still running well under contractual commitment. And so one thing that to understand there is that we are getting cash in now into deficiency payments, but we are not able to reflect that in our current results until we get either they start moving the volumes or they -- their makeup rights expires and. And so that\u2019s kind of holding back the performance of KMCC a little bit, but again the cash is coming in the door. But you\u2019re exactly right, the way that system is now being developed, I mean, it is gone from in a very short period of time -- it is gone from kind of the point-to-point system to being a network. A network that we can build off of and then we can invest and invest at very high returns on those incremental capital spend. And so we\u2019ve got about $300 million worth of laterals and associated facilities like truck offloading and tank facilities that are in our backlogged that we haven\u2019t yet seen the revenue off but they run fairly quick built outs that we can do and we are doing. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to find more of that. And Ron do you have anything to add to that?","Ron McClain","I just think there is a lot of option now until you, and once you get to the Houston Ship Channel it can -- no one can move to petrochemical plants. [Indiscernible] I just think there is tremendous flexibility for shippers and so that capacity will go pretty soon.","Steve Kean","And the other example of that so we had one lateral that we were able to get into service early but we don\u2019t have the tonnes in the other facility that\u2019s going to be necessary to achieve the full throughput. While we\u2019re unloading trucks into that lateral right now and we just ramp that up over the coming year. So again if you look at that system, it\u2019s now connected to multiple producers, kind of CDPs and also truck offloading facilities, connected to the multiple producers. And we can now take it to multiple markets. It goes to the Phillips 66, Sweeny refineries in South of Houston. It goes to the Houston Ship Channel. And we\u2019re connecting it up with Double Eagle so it can go to Cortez as well, so just a great network that allows high return project to be built off of it.","Darren Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Zarahn with Barclays. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Hi Brian.","Brian Zarahn - Barclays Capital","Hi Rich I appreciate the project backlog update. And what\u2019s the status of the Y grade line of the Marcellus, Utica? Where do we stand?","Rich Kinder","Yes, we continue to work on it but we don\u2019t have commitments yet. So we are not putting it in the backlog. There is some indication from the market that people have been very focused on getting some of their dry gas outlet taking care of course and they\u2019re going to turn their focus and attention to additional wet woods or NGL outlets. So I would say that the interest in the project continues to grow. So the update for the quarter is people are interested and more interested than they were the quarter before. But until that turns itself into signatures on contracts again it\u2019s not going in the backlog and we\u2019re not going to call it done.","And as Tom pointed out, we do have the ability to use that line. We\u2019re preserving the ability to do both. And that\u2019s our preference. We want to do residue gas outlets on the TGP system. We want to presser the Y grade option assuming our customers are willing to sign-up. But ultimately if they\u2019re not, then we can put that line in residue gas service and put it to good use that way. So long story short, we don\u2019t have the commitments we need yet, but I think interests from the customers continue to grow and we\u2019ll keep working on it.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","And then I guess that and the other project that are not in your backlog and how should we think about the potential growth and the inventory now through 2017 if some of these projects are added, maybe currently 16.4, I mean can we got to a $20 billion number or how should we just think of a range with potential outcomes?","Steve Kean","Hi Brian and as you know we\u2019re being very conservative about that different people take different approaches to how they articulate their backlog. People sometimes put in projects that they think ought to get done or have a good reason to get done, but we have tend to put in the ones that are just very high probability. And so for example UTOPIA I think is a project that gets done but we\u2019re not quite there yet. We got to have an open season, we got to firm that LOI up in to a real firm transport commitment. That's another 300 plus million dollar project there.","If you remember from Investor Day, Tom articulated about $15 billion worth of projects in the natural gas sector alone, adding on to what we\u2019ve signed up here recently on EPNG may be getting at a couple of those northeast expansion, both of the northeast expansion projects so we did the non-binding open season in. Those are billion dollar, multibillion dollar moves or additions to the backlog. But again we\u2019re going to continue. I think we\u2019re going to maintain the same methodology here. We\u2019ll identify some of those things for you but we\u2019re going to keep the backlog limited to those things that we\u2019re highly confident we\u2019re going to put in service.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","And then turning to\u2026","Steve Kean","Just to say we\u2019d be highly confident we\u2019re going to put in service.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","Okay. Turning to Ruby, it looks like GIP is ready to sell its remaining 50% stake. How do you think about that option?","Rich Kinder","Well, we'll just see how that develops. Clearly as we\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to drop -- KMI is going drop its half down to EPB this year and we\u2019ll just see how the GIP sale goes and really don\u2019t have any counting on it other than that.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","Okay. And then on the CO2 business, what impact if any is backwardation having on your hedging program?","Rich Kinder","Well we maintain the discipline under our hedging program and we hedge whatever the price is and obviously the backwardated market that hedged price in the out years is lower than the front-end. We believe that will probably change but we\u2019re not in the business under our hedge policy of guessing on that, so we stay within our parameters. Obviously within those parameters we try to pick off the days when the out years are a little stronger. But we\u2019re maintaining that as we always do, we have we\u2019re more heavily hedged obviously in the front-end than in the back-end.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","And just a last one from me on the warrants how many are standing at the moment?","Kim Dang","317 million.","Brian Zarahn - Barclay Capital","Thanks Kim.","Operator","Next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Ted, how are you doing?","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Hey doing well, thanks Rich. Just want to come back to gas here and may be again push a little bit more on -- what\u2019s the sort of incremental capital you think you need to put in two, three ups in other Bcf a day of volumes out of the Marcellus to get to the Gulf Coast?","Rich Kinder","Tom?","Tom Martin","Yes, I mean that\u2019s a tough one. Again it really just depends where the source of supply is and ultimately where we\u2019re trying to get to. I mean I think right now the biggest volume opportunity is going to be the Marcellus supply project into right New York and right New York into New England, those are going to be the most cost effective expansions right now and then we\u2019ll look at -- we\u2019re continuing to look at how we can get more volume down to the Gulf Coast but those are going to be more expensive.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then can you give us any more color around whether it\u2019s the most recent supply project, you have done a project with Antero or the future ones, how are you thinking about sort of the option value of the capacity you have. Would you charge max rates? Should we expect negotiated rates that would be higher than what your sort of tariff that is on file with the FERC?","Rich Kinder","Yes, I think you can expect it all on our new projects. These are negotiated rate contracts.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Got it.","Tom Martin","Higher than a non-filed tariff yes they have to justify the capital expenditure.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Right. Got it. And then if we\u2019re thinking about and this is a small one but just the impact of weather on some of the volumes just may be in the gas segment or any other segments. Can you quantify that at all?","Rich Kinder","The impact of weather was -- Steve can take you through the exact increase year-over-year, but a lot of what we\u2019re seeing now is longer term demand across the whole system and to me that\u2019s much more important than weather. Steve can give you\u2026","Steve Kean","I think that\u2019s the key as that when Rich was talking about the 2.8 Bcf of contracts, those were 15 year average commitment or nearly 15 years commitment. So that\u2019s not about the weather, that\u2019s not about a cold winter. That\u2019s obviously -- that\u2019s about long-term need or long-term demand for the capacity. I think we saw benefits from the colder weather certainly on the Texas intrastate we saw it on NGPL, the NGPL asset. On a lot of our other assets, intrastate assets we\u2019re pretty much looking at demand charge, primarily demand charge based revenue received so it\u2019s a little less whether dependent in the short run, I mean, again everybody got a real wakeup about the need to hold firm transport capacity this winter and I think that again holds promise for demand for future capacity and maybe for some of the expansions into the northeast for example, but that\u2019s not really a short-term phenomena, that\u2019s really just driving long-term demand for transportation. And as I mention you know we had record, we got very high storage results on the Texas intrastate and for good sales opportunities for us there as well.","Ted Durbin - Goldman Sachs","Great. I leave you at that. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.","Rich Kinder","Great. Craig, how are you doing?","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Good. Thanks Rich. Good afternoon. Let\u2019s stay on the potential growth opportunities, can you just update us on the FERC application at Elba prospects you are securing FTA-based export contracts for Gulf LNG and if you are any more optimistic around non-FTA authorizations now that I think Elba six in line and Gulf LNG is seventh and Russia is saber rattling?","Rich Kinder","Yes. [Indiscernible] On the FERC application we have filed the FERC application for Elba now and I of course remember that that\u2019s not contingent, really that\u2019s the only contingent left just getting the FERC approval because it\u2019s not contingent on non-FTA approval, although we think we\u2019d like to have that that would give our customers show a little more of leave way and work loose the LNG out of Elba. But we filed and are moving forward on that so that\u2019s about to grow.","On Gulf LNG we and our partner there just primarily GE have now authorized money on a pre-feed expeditor. We have a lot of interest there. And we think that about the time we complete the pre-feed we will have MOU signed for that capacity at Gulf LNG. Now, let me be very clear the MOUs are MOUs and that doesn\u2019t mean they are fully binding on either side because we will certainly want to go beyond the pre-feed to nail down the cost of the project and our customers will want to nail down the cost, the tariff is going to be charge them, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve turned more optimistic on that and we and GE together have decided to go forward with the pre-feed based on the conversations we\u2019ve had over the last two or three months.","I think this whole LNG export market has become more interesting, I don\u2019t know if they are going to move up the liquidity of approval on a non-FTA request given what\u2019s happening in [indiscernible]. I would think they should and that as others have said they should use FERC as a clearing agency as opposed to DOE making decisions, they should just approve ever by like FERC started out, and let the contract work started out. But we\u2019ll see how that turns around but we believe that Gulf LNG does have some potential and we\u2019ll count on that.","Steven Kean","Yes I think we have a feeling over there that as you know Gulf LNG is the last remaining ground field with the fraction opportunity and I think what our balance sheet I think the customer response and the interest has been very positive so far.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Great. And if I can get Jim for a second, it looks like your oil production fell 1.5% sequentially, but they are obviously out year-over-year. Can you provide any color on the progression of production this year? And do you have any updates you can share about the potential CO2 supply sales in the California, the LNG flooding or ROZ?","Jim Wuerth","From the volumes SACROC continues to be strong, month to-date we are so running about 32,000 barrels a day. And Yates, you know it\u2019s a slow decline there we\u2019re trying to do what we can to maintain that as best as we can, the other two new ones are both responding pretty well in a last few days, at Katz we\u2019ve been close to 4,000 barrels a day and at Goldsmith we\u2019re 15,000 barrels a day, so both are moving up. So I think the outlook on the crude side is volume is still really good.","As far as potential of CO2 to California, obviously that\u2019s going to be a long haul project, we do have some -- obviously we have some interest out there from some customers, we\u2019ve signed some documents there, but that probably be putting on can you get approval to move CO2 into California, so that\u2019s where we are working today. As far as the Yates had to cover miserable project where we should be kicking that off here this quarter, the test I filled it on that and based on the results of that, we\u2019ll move that forward.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","And anything on ROZ that you could share at this point?","Rich Kinder","Obviously we\u2019ve done some additional phase I drilling and continue to be very bullish on what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re actually out in the phase I area now drilling, start-up couple of wells out there, so hopefully we should have something that where we\u2019re injecting CO2 by the end of the year.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Okay. And one general question, when you say that CO2 is recycled over many years each time it\u2019s not the same quantity right, because you\u2019re getting 30% to 50% each time. So ultimately like when you buy 100 million cubic feet of CO2 to inject, how many times do you think you\u2019re going to inject that twice or three times?","Rich Kinder","One ways you can kind of look at it is on a normal field you have to purchase about 6 Mcf per barrel of oil. What really happens is you have about 11 to 13 times that you inject the volumes of CO2. So a little about double, little over double basically it says that rolls to at least twice.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","That\u2019s very helpful. And last question back to Rich, if Jim does as well as it sounds, it\u2019s possible and ROZ and EUR still looked at as a negative roll for KMP. Could you see an argument long-term for why the broader CO2 segment may make more sense to trade separately than stay in EPB?","Rich Kinder","EPB, you mean as a separate MLP?","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers","Yeah, I mean people always ask you once in a blue moon would you ever consolidate EPB. Obviously that makes some sense over time, the question is if it\u2019s getting the respect and it\u2019s laying down the rest of the business and there is other natural interested investors in it. Why long-term when we just have a good portion of CO2 just trade separately?","Rich Kinder","Well we look at all alternatives certainly there is a lot of issues on what the tax basis would be, spotted out. Lot of issues we\u2019re doing, separating and we\u2019re very bullish on the CO2 business I think right now not being appropriate time to do something like that. We saw at the analyst presentation the kind of uptick in distributable cash flow, we expect from those operations. It\u2019s a unique entity because everybody right now is in love with the Permian basin in terms of E&P activities there; well that\u2019s where we are. But the thing that separates us from most other people is we have our own in house supply of CO2 which we certainly will and can sell to third parties. But we can also use for our own efforts which gives us I think a tremendous leg up and enable to continue to grow things like ROZ if that turns out and certainly sack (Ph) rock is just a big field, things are getting bigger we\u2019re really pleased with the way everything is going here. So we are very pleased with, again we always consider all kinds of alternatives at Kinder Morgan but we think CO2 is a good fit the way it is.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","With all of the opportunities in the natural gas pipeline segment, I was wondering if you could provide an update on investments in the partnerships coal terminals and also by Kinder Morgan resources. And somewhat related I think \u201814 budget called for about 23% increase in coal export volume due to increased capacity along the Gulf. Is that still your expectation in light of the weak met coal pricing?","Rich Kinder","We have actually a budget of 27 million tonnes as we mentioned at the analyst meeting 25 million of that is under a long-term take or pay. And we were off slightly on tonnage in this quarter 1.3 million tonnes we were actually up $2.3 million over our plan owing to short haul payments from our customers there.","We did complete one transaction at Kinder Morgan resources our first one, it was a Blue Eagle and Central App, it was 25 million tonnes acquisition -- $25 million, 25 million tonnes of proven capacity, proven reserves. First one has a very nice high-teen returns and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing others as they progress.","Unidentified Analyst","And then also with regard to the BOSTCO, I was wondering how is the market for black oils right now including like micro fuel. And how have your plans evolved with regard to developing BOSTCO as you move into considering Phase 2.","Rich Kinder","We just commissioned our 49th of 51 tanks last week, it\u2019s ramping up nice, we expect it to be completely online by the end of the second quarter. And we\u2019re looking at a Phase 3 expansion right now. Phase 3 can go one of two ways we can look at more distilled or more black oils there. I personally believe there will be leaning towards the distillate side as we go forward. And the market seems to be very strong we\u2019re looking at expansion and a further expansion at our Pasadena and Galena Park on the gasoline side and strong demand on distillates as well specifically on the export side.","Operator","Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","I had just a few questions, on the broad run pipeline expansion and associated sort of infrastructure investments. What do you guys expect for the revenue contribution from that $782 million investment?","Rich Kinder","We\u2019ve got effective mid teens unlevered rate of return on and it really comes into service in two pieces. So we have fairly low capital portion of it that will compete in 2015 but that\u2019s a fair amount of revenue associated with that. And then the rest of it comes online in 2017. I don\u2019t know -- I don\u2019t think we have this specific separate number representing what that revenue after that CapEx will be that I think just used the kind of mid teens return, if you guide.","Rich Kinder","I think fair enough.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","And then it\u2019s on the CO2 business with the expansion project you guys announced how much of the 300 million cubic feet a day is for third parties versus yourself?","Rich Kinder","We\u2019ll see how that turns out what exact mix is. We have lot of demand for it right now and we\u2019re going to see, wait a little bit to see how that ROZ wells turnout before we make a decision on how much to sell to third party. But it will be a mix of sales to third parties and utilization to our self and that\u2019s one of the nice position that we\u2019re as we can kind of make that call as we\u2019re drilling up St. John and building Lobos pipeline.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup","Okay, got it. And then can you give us a sense of sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the timing on making a decision on whether - there is a potential combination for EPB into KMP?","Rich Kinder","That would be up to the two sets of independent directors, Faisel. At some point and I\u2019ve said this all along, it probably does make sense to put two together but it\u2019s got to be on terms that both of them agree and so we\u2019ll see how that plays out over the remainder of this year. And again we\u2019re going to complete dropdown to EPB that we\u2019ve agreed on and get that done and then we\u2019ll how see the whole thing plays out. But it will be a primarily decision of the two, the two sets of independent directors.","Operator","And the next question comes from John Edward with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Edward - Credit Suisse","Just a couple of questions. You\u2019ve talked about the increase to the inventory of backlog projects and I know you sort of had inventory of identified but not put in the backlog yet at Analyst Day and I think it was something like 24.5 billion or thereabouts and I\u2019m just wondering what changes your scene there and if you can give us kind of rough idea of where that stands?","Rich Kinder","We didn\u2019t really update that since the Investor Conference. So I think as you saw the guidance as anything, I mean, I think we have seen stuff particularly on the GAAP sector I think pop on to the radar screen not going to the backlog, the top onto the radar screen since the conference. And I think one of the things we\u2019ve showed in the conference that had been on the backlog, but sort of jumped from not on the horizon to the backlog with the Magnolia project for example our transport capacity off of Kinder Morgan Louisiana in support of the Magnolia project. But look I think that the trend generally -- we haven\u2019t updated that number but the trend generally is that we\u2019re seeing more opportunities as driven by the things that Rich was talking about infrastructure investment in North America to support all this production. And the demand side which we\u2019re now just speaking and\/or kind of on the front with appear on the GAAP side has the tendency the direction on it is to add to that project.","John Edward - Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just kind of following on Brad\u2019s earlier questions on TGP. In terms of say BCF per day available for reversals, what do you have available this point and then I know you negotiate the rates but just broadly speaking about what kind of rate that does it take to ship gas on TGP now from on a reversal type project, broadly not asking to disclose your confidential rates but just kind of in broad terms if you talk about that?","Rich Kinder","I guess everything they were shipping now will be under expansion project that was going to take additional capital and create more capacity. And as I said earlier, all the low hanging fruits have been picked, so the cost of the next project will be greater than what we had to dispense due to Ontario project with broad one project. I don\u2019t we\u2019re done, but I think as I said earlier, I think the most cost effective next expansion that we do will actually be Marcellus project that ultimately feeds into New England as opposed coming next to Gulf Coast, but we\u2019ll certainly look at it. And we\u2019re seeing rates generally in market from projects out in open seasons to be somewhere approaching the dollar now from Marcellus to the Gulf Coast, so I think in general terms that\u2019s probably a number to be thinking about.","John Edward - Credit Suisse","Okay that\u2019s helpful. So just to confirm and when you say the low hanging fruit is now gone at this point, there is not really a lot of available capacity because you haven\u2019t spent some fairly significant dollars to do reversal, is that a correct way to interpret that?","Rich Kinder","I mean we\u2019ve got everything under contract now to support all these expansion projects and we\u2019re fully sold out.","John Edward - Credit Suisse","Okay great and then in terms of you did mention you\u2019ve bought back both warrant and KMI stock during the quarter. I think you said 55 million on the warrant and 84 million on the KMI stock during the quarter, so in terms of weighing those two how you\u2019re looking that tradeoff between buying those back?","Rich Kinder","The analysis that we do is same that we described you in our quarters. During the quarter, the repurchases of stock were done first and then we completed that $150 million authorization and then you probably saw the 8-K in March where we announced $100 million authorization and we spent about 55 of that and that was all warrant repurchased.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Christine Chou with Barclays. Your line is open.","Christine Chou - Barclays","Can we go over the expectation for the four-time that the EBITDA number by yearend 2014 at EPB? The Gulf LNG and Ruby asset will be coming with over $1 billion of debt and I think your budget assumes 600 million of issuances. So taking all that with the EBITDA that the drops will contribute partially offset by lower rate fund SNG and WIC. I get a number close to the 43 now just wondering if something has changed or if there is anything I\u2019m missing.","Rich Kinder","Ruby and Gulf LNG are joint ventures and the debt will not be consolidated. We do not believe and so the four-time is without consolidation of those joint ventures.","Christine Chou - Barclays","Okay, perfect. And then just following up on the Ruby question that Brian asked and I know you\u2019ve talked about your intent to drop Ruby into EPB, but is there possibility of selling your half on the table at all kind of similar to what happens when the other partners of Express-Platte hold our stakes?","Rich Kinder","Yes, we look at any reason probably but we\u2019re not actively marketing it Christine. We\u2019re in the process of dropping it down and to good long-term asset with what a good contracts that run out into the next decade. But we wouldn\u2019t rule out any possibilities on it.","Christine Chou - Barclays","Okay great. And then can you provide us any update on the TGP abandonment process for the capacity that you would like to convert for the Y-grade line?","Rich Kinder","Yes, I can say we have not filed to seek abandonment of it. We would want to see the commercial part of this to make sure further, but we believe we worked closely with good advisors to articulate a clear path to get to abandonment. But we\u2019re not other than sort of getting prepared we\u2019re not at the point of filing.","Christine Chou - Barclays","And then once you, if and when you do file it\u2019s about 9 month, is that the process?","Rich Kinder","Now we have assessed probably more, more like a year then working on.","Christine Chou - Barclays","Okay and then last one for me. This is just a broader question as we try to figure out how gas flows are going to involve in the next year or two? With respect to the NGPL reversal once the gas gets into the system from racks we should first have the option to go North or South?","Rich Kinder","On the secondary basis but on the firm basis, the path will be held down.","Christine Chou - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rich Kinder","Okay and that\u2019s it Holly. So we thank you very much for your questions in a good call. We think we had a good quarter and we look forward to talking to you again soon.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect at this time."],"12451":["Kinder Morgan, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this point.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the meeting over Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Richard Kinder","Okay, thank you, Shaun, and welcome to the KMI first quarter investor call. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s earnings release and this call include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","We encourage you to read our full disclosure on forward-looking statements and use of non-GAAP financial measures set forth at the end of our earnings release, as well as review our latest filings with the SEC for a list of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward-looking statements.","I\u2019ll start the call and before I turn it over to our CEO, Steve Kean, and our CFO, Kim Dang, I\u2019d like to give you a quick overview of our strategy at KMI. The first point I would make is that this quarter\u2019s results again demonstrate that we remain a strong generator of cash even in these chaotic times for the energy sector.","Second, as we\u2019ve said previously and at our meeting in January, we do not anticipate any requirement to access the equity markets for the foreseeable future. We also do not see any requirement to access the debt markets for the foreseeable future, except for rollovers in years subsequent to 2016.","We\u2019ve again reduced our expansion CapEx, Steve will take you through that, for 2016 and we expect that trend to continue in subsequent years through both high-grading our projects and entering into selective joint ventures. We expect to fund the necessary CapEx out of our cash flow and continue to improve our debt to EBITDA ratio, thereby preserving and strengthening our investment grade balance sheet.","As our cash flow achieves those objectives, funding our CapEx and strengthening our balance sheet, we will obviously have excess cash which we will then use to either raise our dividend, purchase our shares, or for new projects and\/or acquisitions, but only if they are solidly accretive to our distributable cash flow per share.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over Steve.","Steven Kean","Okay, thanks Rich. I\u2019m going to hit on three topics before giving you some segment highlights for the quarter. First, an update to our capital projects and our expected growth spend for 2016, an update on our outlook for the balance of 2016 and some thoughts on our counterparty credit risk.","With respect to the capital update, we announced today a reduction in our project backlog of $4.1 billion, so from $18.2 billion down to $14.1 billion. The two biggest adjustments are the removal of the Palmetto Pipeline project, which is a reduction of $550 million and the market portion of the NED project, which is a reduction of $3.1 billion.","With respect to NED, we worked very hard; this is our Northeast Direct project, serving \u2013 or that would have served New England market. We worked very hard to get customer commitments on the project. And while many of our LDC customers did sign up, we did not receive enough contractual commitments from electric customers to make the project viable. So we will fulfill our obligation to consult with our customers over the next 30 days or so, but this project is not economic, so we\u2019re removing it from the backlog. In both cases, NED and Palmetto, based on all the facts, we believe this is the right outcome for our investors.","To be specific, the return on the NED project at the level of commitments that we have would be less than 6% unlevered after tax. That\u2019s clearly not viable and we are far better off having that cash available for other uses, whether that\u2019s continued and even accelerated delevering, other investment opportunities or returning value to shareholders.","We value our New England customers and continue to believe along with many others that additional capacity is needed in the region, but we\u2019ll have to look for other ways to serve some part of those needs. We didn\u2019t get there on this one and the action we\u2019re taking is undeniably the right call for our investors. We previously wrote off, I\u2019ll remind you, our NED Supply project and we never had that one in the backlog.","On the Palmetto pipeline, essentially the Georgia legislature prevented us from getting eminent domain and also prevented us from getting other state permits. We were making good progress with land acquisition even without eminent domain, but we needed other permits which Georgia has now put a moratorium on. We needed environmental permits, for example, which they\u2019ve now put a moratorium on until mid 2017. So as a result, we are not moving forward with Palmetto.","We had some other small adjustments to the backlog, including putting about $160 million worth of projects in service during the quarter. We had some cost changes which netted to a reduction of $254 million in the overall backlog and we had some other scope additions and removals which essentially offset each other.","So looking at the bigger picture on our capital project spend, we continue to high-grade our capital investments to ensure that we\u2019re securing our investment grade credit metrics and maximizing the returns we get for the capital that we do deploy. We\u2019re aiming to reduce spend, improve returns, and selectively joint venture projects where that makes sense.","We\u2019ve reduced our expected 2016 spend by an additional $400 million to $2.9 billion. So that compares to the $3.3 billion that we projected in January for 2016, which in turn was $900 million down from the $4.2 billion that we projected in our preliminary 2016 guidance, which we sent out last December. So we\u2019ve continued to work through our backlog and high-grade where we\u2019re spending our capital.","With respect to joint ventures, as we discussed at the January conference, we\u2019d be pursuing these where they made sense that is where we could share the capital spending obligation on a particular project with a third party, get paid a reasonable value for having originated the opportunity, et cetera. Those processes are competitive and confidential, so only going to be able to give you limited details. But the summary is that the process is going well and we currently expect to achieve the results that we built into our plan.","We\u2019re also taking care to not be dependent on any one transaction. These processes can be unpredictable and we will be in a position to back away from a given transaction if acceptable value does not materialize. Overall, as we complete projects and further high grade the backlog, as Rich mentioned, we will free up cash that we can use to reduce debt, return cash to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends or invest in attractive projects or acquisitions or some combination of those.","Now for the 2016 outlook update, we have looked at the potential impacts for the remainder of 2016 due to continued weakness in the sector. We now estimate on a full year basis for 2016 a negative impact of about 3% to the EBITDA that we showed in January. But because of our ongoing efforts to high grade our capital spend and to pursue the joint ventures where it makes sense, we expect to meet our investment grade credit metrics, notwithstanding the 3% reduction.","That 3% EBITDA reduction translates into a 4% reduction in DCF. As the year goes on, we will try to mitigate that negative, but we are not assuming in this outlook any dramatic turnaround for our producer customers by the end of the year as some analysts have predicted.","Now, we\u2019re not happy about any negative to plan, but I think when you put this in the context of the dramatic production declines particularly in the Eagle Ford, which is down 28% on oil from its peak and 15% on gas and credit weaknesses, our business is really diversified and insulated from the full brunt of the weakness in the producing sector.","So here are the two main contributors. A little under half of the deterioration is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes and those flow through both our midstream group in the gas business unit and also in our products group. And again this is all comparing to our original outlook, so this is not a year over year look. This is versus our January outlook that we presented at the conference.","So a little over half attributable to the Eagle Ford; another 20% is attributable to the coal customer bankruptcies. So there are a lot of other pieces and Kim will take you through some additional details, but those are the two big chunks contributing to the degradation in the forecast.","So while the current year outlook for North American energy production is experiencing weakness, we\u2019re still bullish on the longer term. We believe that we\u2019ll continue to see more of our North American energy needs met by North American energy production that will grow our exports; we\u2019ve already been growing refined products, natural gas to Mexico. I think we\u2019ll continue to see growth in natural gas and natural gas liquids exports. And those long-term trends are good for North American energy midstream companies like Kinder Morgan.","Okay, the third general topic is counterparty credit. We\u2019ve been monitoring counterparty credit very closely, but beyond monitoring we\u2019ve been taking action, have been calling on collateral, putting other credit support arrangements in place. A few points about our particular circumstances.","Given our diverse business mix, we\u2019ve got a very broad and diverse customer base. We\u2019ve got producer customers, of course, but we also have integrated energy companies, gas and electric utilities and industrial users of our services. We\u2019re not exposed to any single sector, commodity or service. That diversifies our exposure, which reduces our risk.","Our top 25 customers constitute 44% of our revenue. And of that revenue, 85% is investment grade. Of our total revenue, about 75% is investment grade or has substantial credit support and 86% is rated B or better. In our business, real exposure is more complicated than simply looking at our customers\u2019 rating.","In many cases, the rights our customers hold are valuable to third parties or essential to the revenue generating activities of those customers and therefore will be needed on an ongoing basis by the customer or in the worst case the debtor in possession in bankruptcy or a subsequent purchaser.","We analyze all of those factors and mitigation to get to our credit concern list. Our identified credit concern list amounts to about 5% of revenue and about half of that is mitigated by credit support or underlying resale value of the capacity that the customers hold. And those numbers, that 5% and that half of five percent include Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy which we\u2019re now reflecting, so the going forward number is less than that. We\u2019re reflecting Peabody, the Peabody bankruptcy in our forecast update.","So in the segments, few highlights looking at the first quarter 2016 to Q1 of 2015. The overall summary is this. On an earnings before DD&A and certain items basis, three of our five business units grew year over year. Gas was up 4%; products pipelines was up 17%; terminals was up 2%; Kinder Morgan Canada would have been up year over year but for the effect of a weakening Canadian dollar; and CO2 was down 21% as a result of lower commodity prices and some lower production.","On natural gas pipelines, we had very strong performance on TGP and the contributions from our Highland midstream acquisition. So we split the Highland acquisition between our midstream business unit in gas and our products pipelines for the Double H pipeline. So contributions from really, really strong performance on TGP and the contribution from our Highland midstream acquisition that we made in the first quarter of last year and those two things more than offset weakness in our other midstream assets and in our western pipelines.","The midstream weakness is largely gathering and processing in the Eagle Ford, and on a year over year basis, gathering in the Haynesville. In the west, year over year growth on our [ET&G] system was more than offset by weakness in Cheyenne Plains, WIC, CIG and TransColorado as the fundamentals for bases pipes out of the Rockies continues to degrade.","Natural gas needs for transportation and storage services, we believe, should grow over the medium and long term as power generation exports including L&G and exports to Mexico and pet chem and industrial demand continue to grow. Over the last two years, the gas group has entered into new and pending firm transport capacity commitments totaling 8.2 bcf and I think importantly about 1.8 bcf of that was existing previously unsold capacity. And we currently estimate that we move about 38% of the natural gas consumed in the United States on our pipeline.","Moving to the products segment, the 17% year over year growth in segment earnings was driven by growth in KMCC, that\u2019s our Crude and Condensate pipeline of Eagle Ford and the full quarter operation of the splitter, the first splitter in the Houston Ship Channel. We have both splitters up and running in the Houston Ship Channel.","We also saw good refined products transportation growth, 2.3% increase year over year. And while Eagle Ford volumes have declined overall and we are projecting some decline on our assets as we look forward, we have seen volumes grow on our KMCC pipeline as projects have come on and we think that\u2019s due to the pipe is in a great position, it\u2019s serving a great part of that market, it has good upstream and downstream connectivity and good contracts.","Now, we think we\u2019ve just started to see some flattening in that pipeline. But if you think about what\u2019s happened in the Eagle Ford overall, what we\u2019ve done on this pipe is essentially dramatically grow our market share out of the basin on that pipe.","CO2, we saw earnings before DD&A decline 20% year over year to $223 million for the quarter. Production net to our interests was down 7%. And I will point out SACROC was down, but [just you can] confirm this, but I think we had our highest quarter probably in the fourth quarter of 2014 at SACROC and then our next highest was in the first quarter of 2015. So a very strong quarter in 2015 that we\u2019re comparing to our 2016 performance.","The CO2 group has \u2013 while I also mentioned price, the weighted average realized price has declined about 18% year over year and of course that\u2019s a big part of the explanation for the downturn on a year over year basis. CO2, on the bright side, CO2 group has been very diligent in reducing costs and husbanding our capital to the very highest available return opportunities. And I will say perhaps somewhat counterintuitively third party demand for CO2 under our arrangements with them has stayed strong or roughly flat year over year on CO2, notwithstanding the deterioration in commodity prices.","Moving to terminals, terminals was up 2% year over year. Growth in this business came from expansions and acquisitions which slightly more than offset the weakness in our bulk business and that\u2019s been driven primarily by bankruptcies of our coal customers. Most of our liquids terminal business is in refined products and we\u2019ve continued to see high utilization and generally good pricing on rollovers and renewals there and we continue to have a very strong outlook for the great liquids terminals positions that we\u2019ve built in the Houston Ship Channel and Edmonton.","Kinder Morgan Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion project, so again, this is under long term contracts with customers. The three key areas of focus for us remain getting the NEB recommended order and the cabinet-level Order in Council from the federal process, consultation and accommodation with first nations and thirdly satisfaction of the BC government\u2019s five conditions.","We\u2019re making progress on all three. With respect to the NEB, we got our draft conditions last August. We believe that they are manageable, but we did seek some important changes, particularly around the time required to approve certain portions of the build. We now have the outline of the further process to be conducted by the federal government during the Order in Council process, which is expected to result in a final order. They have scheduled the final order for December 20 of this year.","We\u2019re making good progress in meeting the consultation and accommodation obligations we have with the first nations and we\u2019ve added mutual benefit agreements that bring us to a number, a majority of the bands that are most directly affected by the project actually supporting the project.","On the five conditions, we\u2019re still working on those. We are engaged actively with the BC government on those. The BC government is also going to be conducting an environmental review under their provincial process. We expect that both of those things will be concluded within the same time frame of the federal process, maybe not the same day, but within the same general time frame. And we have this project in the backlog and we are aiming for a 2019 completion, end of 2019 completion.","And that\u2019s it for the segment updates. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kim.","Kimberly Allen Dang","Okay, thanks, Steve. Today, we\u2019re declaring a dividend of $0.125 per share. That\u2019s consistent with our budget and the guidance we gave you in December of last year. But most importantly, we generated $954 million of DCF in excess of our dividend, which as Steve and Rich pointed out insulates us from the challenging capital markets and significantly enhances our credit profile.","Let me explain what I mean when we say significantly enhances our credit profile. If you compare our coverage ratio and that\u2019s DCF divided by the dividend, in the first quarter of last year which was 1.2 times versus the 4.4 times in the first quarter of this year, we have significantly more retained cash flow, approximately $750 million and therefore we have no capital markets risk to getting equity raised.","In addition, our previous funding policy was to fund our expansion CapEx 50% equity and 50% debt. Now, we\u2019re using 100% retained cash flow and therefore our balance metrics will improve more quickly than under our prior funding model.","Before we get to DCF, let me point out a couple of things on a GAAP income statement. You will see that revenues, net income available to common shareholders and earnings per share are down. As I say many quarters, we do not believe that these measures or changes in these measures are necessarily a good predictor of our performance.","We have some businesses where revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices, but margin generally does not. In addition, these numbers can be impacted by non-cash nonrecurring accounting issues or what we call certain items. For example, if you look at revenues, revenues are down $402 million or 11%.","However, if you strip out the certain items, with the primary certain item impacting revenues being the CO2 and the mark to market on our other hedges, revenues would be down $316 million. When you compare that $316 million to the $359 million reduction in cost of goods sold, gross margin is actually up. Again, that\u2019s largely because we have some businesses where both revenues and expenses fluctuate with commodity prices.","With respect to net income, if you strip out the certain items, and I\u2019ll go through those with you in a minute, net income before certain items was $446 million compared to $445 million for the same period in 2015 or essentially flat.","EPS before certain items, and here when you do EPS, earnings is defined as net income to common shareholders, so after the payment of the preferred, EPS before certain items was $0.18 versus the $0.12 that you see on the page for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.20 in the first quarter of 2015.","So while stripping out certain items from earnings does help, we still believe that the best indicator of our performance is the cash we generate, which we measure as distributable cash flow and distributable cash flow per share. So let\u2019s turn to the second page of the financials which I believe will give you a clear picture of our performance.","We generated total DCF for the quarter of $1.233 billion versus the $1.242 billion for the comparable period in 2015. Therefore total DCF was down approximately $9 million, essentially flat between the two periods. The segments were up by $28 million as Steve mentioned or 1%, with the increases in natural gas and products which combined for an increase of $85 million, slightly offsetting the $58 million reduction in CO2, which was driven largely by lower crude price.","The $28 million increase in the segment was offset by a $39 million increase in our preferred stock dividends. If you remember, we issued preferred stock in the fourth quarter of last year. Now, there are other moving parts, but if you take the $28 million from the segments offset by the $39 million, that gives you a decrease of $11 million versus a decrease in DCF that I mentioned of $9 million. So that gets you almost all of the change.","DCF per share in the quarter was $0.55 versus $0.58 for the first quarter of last year. DCF per share was down slightly due to the additional shares we issued during 2015 to finance our growth projects and maintain our balance sheet. Therefore, despite an almost 30% decline in commodity prices versus the first quarter of last year, our performance was relatively flat and we believe that this demonstrates the resiliency of our cash flows generated by a large diversified platform of primarily fee based assets.","There are a couple of certain items in the quarter that I want to highlight for you. Certain items in the quarter totaled $235 million loss on a pretax basis, about $132 million loss on an after tax basis. $170 million of the pretax loss was driven by the write off of costs associated with the NED market and the Palmetto project, which as Steve mentioned have also been removed from the backlog.","$85 million was associated with losses on asset disposals and impairments in four of our business segments, with the most significant items being in CO2 and terminals. And CO2 is primarily associated with the write off of the CO2 recapture plant due to lack of expected volumes and in terminals it was due to lost business at three of our bulk terminals. There was a certain tax benefit of $103 million and that\u2019s primarily just the tax impact of the certain items at approximately 35%.","As Steve mentioned in the comments, we currently expect EBITDA for the year to be approximately 3% below our budget and DCF to be approximately 4% below. Now, for the first quarter, we did better than that with EBITDA about 2% below our budget and DCF about 1% below our budget. We believe our outlook is consistent with the current environment and producer decisions and we\u2019re not assuming any improvement.","Let me give you a little more granularity on expected segment performance for the full year versus our budget. We expect natural gas pipelines to come in approximately 2% below its budget, primarily as a result lower volumes, mainly in the Eagle Ford. The other factor impacting our natural gas for the full year is the delay on EEC, SNG pipeline expansion project as a result of the FERC certificate being about three months later than we anticipated.","CO2 is expected to end the year on its budget. We expect prices to be essentially in line with our $38 per barrel in our budget and cost savings to offset any weakness in oil production or CO2 volumes. We expect terminals to end the year approximately 4% below its budget, primarily due to the impact of the Peabody bankruptcy.","We currently expect products to be about 6% below its budget, primarily due to lower crude and condensate volumes on KMCC, Double H and Double Eagle. Right now, we are projecting KMC to be slightly below its budget for the full year due to higher book taxes, but remember the book taxes while they impact the segment have no impact on EBITDA or DCF.","With respect to interest, cash taxes, G&A and sustaining CapEx, on a combined basis, those items are expected to come in slightly positive to budget or said another way generate a favorable variance, with the positives interest and sustaining CapEx more than offsetting the negatives on G&A and cash taxes.","The negative variance on G&A is driven by lower capitalized overhead as a result of the lower expansion capital that Steve mentioned and interest expense is expected to be lower than budget due to lower LIBOR rates.","And with that, I\u2019ll move to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $41.555 billion and EBITDA for the trailing 12 months was about $7.4 billion, which results in a debt to EBITDA of about 5.6 times, consistent with where we ended the year last year. And as Steve mentioned, we still expect to end 2016 at 5.5 times, consistent with our budget.","Our debt was up in the quarter, an increase in debt of about $330 million since the end of the last year. So let me reconcile that for you. We generated DCF in the quarter, as I mentioned a minute ago, of $1.233 billion. We spent about $700 million in CapEx, we spent about $245 million roughly on acquisitions, with almost all of that being associated with the BP acquisition and we contributed about $44 million to equity investments, about $990 million roughly attributable to our expansion CapEx program.","We paid dividends of $279 million and then there were working capital and other items that were a use of roughly $300 million. When you look at the use of working capital, about \u2013 over $150 million of that was associated with accrued interest. And when I give you the DCF figure of $1.233 billion that has three months of accrued interest in it, but we make interest payments twice a year.","We make them primarily in the first quarter and the third quarter and so we make cash interest payments in the first quarter attributable to six months. So you have a working capital use associated with that incremental six months of cash going out the door, which is different from the three months of accrual that\u2019s in DCF.","The other working capital use in the quarter was primarily associated with property tax and there\u2019s probably about $100 million associated with that. Again, we have about three months of property tax accrual in the quarter. By the time you get to the end of the year, you have 12 months of accrual, but a lot of our property tax payments are made for the full year in January. And therefore, relative to DCF, you have a working capital use in the quarter. In future quarters, you will have a working capital source. And that gets you to about $330 million increase in debt.","And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rich.","Richard Kinder","Okay. And at this time, Shaun, we will take questions that people may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","I was just wondering if you \u2013 as far as the guidance reduction, what were the different drivers there, if you could walk through that just one more time for us that would be helpful.","Steven Kean","I\u2019ll start with the two big pieces and then Kim has some additional detail. But as I said, about just \u2013 a little under half of it, a little under 50% of the reduction is attributable to lower Eagle Ford volumes than what we had in the plan. So I talked about volumes being up year over year, but versus what we had in the plan, we had lower Eagle Ford volumes. And that impact \u2013 that\u2019s trying to sum up everything.","So that is on our Eagle Ford gathering system itself, on our [TK header line] and the processing facility. It\u2019s also volumes that we\u2019re entering into our Texas Intrastate system that we expected to be able to move on that system and collect transport fees. So it\u2019s kind of from end to end almost on the Eagle Ford volumes through our Texas assets.","The other place where we have exposure of the Eagle Ford volumes is in our products pipelines where we have the KMCC pipeline and the splitter. And we\u2019d expected the splitter in our plan to run a little bit above its contract minimums. We have good contracts with good protection there. It\u2019s running \u2013 we\u2019re expecting to kind of just run at the minimums, which are pretty good. I mean, it\u2019s a pretty high percentage of the capacity of the facility, but we had budgeted a little bit more there.","And KMCC, we expect we\u2019re now going to start to see some volumetric decline on that. Again, that\u2019s all versus plan. So that\u2019s a little \u2013 if you just say \u2013 and look, there are lots of different ways to rack up these numbers, but that\u2019s \u2013 those factors, the Eagle Ford volumes as they impact two of our business units amount to about half, a little less than half of the adjustment. Another 20% is attributable to the coal company bankruptcy. So those are the two very big pieces.","Jeremy Tonet","And then as far as the decision to take NED off now versus later, can you just walk through the timing to it? And then also just if you\u2019re looking to high grade the growth CapEx backlog, are there any other items that are kind of coming under closer scrutiny that you could point us towards or you kind of feel like where the backlog is right now is a good place for where you want it to be?","Steven Kean","So on the first point and I want to separate that a little bit from the high grading discussion because, look, we gave it our all on NED. I mean, we pursued customers hard, we pursued approvals hard. In the end, the customer commitments just weren\u2019t there. Now, that makes the project uneconomic not surprisingly and that\u2019s why I wanted to specify the return for you. It\u2019s apparent, it\u2019s objectively apparent that the project is not economically a viable project at that customer sign up level.","And so we said at the conference we\u2019re going to make a big push in the first quarter to try to get customer commitments in and sell down some of the equity to customers, not a lot of takers at that return as you might expect and so we put on a hard push to try to get done and it\u2019s just not forthcoming. We have one significant prospective customer who determined to put their volume someplace else and that was a significant negative for the project.","So that\u2019s how we got to that decision in the time that we\u2019re talking about now, but I want to go back and underscore again from an investor standpoint, in light of that return, we are a lot better off with that $3.1 billion back in our pockets and being put to some other use. The project wasn\u2019t going to produce the return that would be required to make it viable, because again the contracts weren\u2019t there. We\u2019re better off having that money back.","I think if you look through the rest of the backlog, my guess is we\u2019ll find some bits and pieces here and there that will either will save some money on or may change the timing a little bit. I still think those are high probability projects though and ones that we want to build out and do and they contribute to our DCF per share growth that we\u2019re aiming to achieve by building it out.","Kimberly Allen Dang","And just to underscore the average, the year one EBITDA multiple on the projects in the backlog excluding CO2, so as we said on CO2, we look at the project at the time we enter into, I mean, it\u2019s a forward curve at that time and we target at least a 15% unlevered after tax return. But on the non-CO2 projects, the average year one multiple, EBITDA multiple is 6.7 times.","Jeremy Tonet","And then one last one if I could, just curious how you guys think about high level now as far as \u2013 with the backlog standing at $14 billion, the size of the entity as it is right now, what type of EBITDA growth do you guys see yourself being able to achieve? Is there anything different than what you guys have communicated historically as far as base growth that this business can throw off?","Richard Kinder","One very simple way to look at it is take the 6.7 multiple off of $14.1 billion and divide that by the number of shares outstanding and you can see what that works out to be. And it\u2019s $0.70, $0.75 per share.","Kimberly Allen Dang","You take out the CO2 from the $14.1 billion and then you\u2019ll get roughly \u2013 it\u2019s going to be in the range of $1.8 billion and all but [$175 million] is incremental to 2016.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","First question just a follow up on the discussion on CapEx, when I look at it for 2016, you\u2019ve now revised it lower again, which I guess is good in this environment. You also mentioned that in terms of pulling NED out about how you\u2019re focusing on returns, I think you\u2019d made a general comment about just trying to high grade returns and so forth.","The change this year, how much is related just to the removal of NED and Palmetto verses \u2013 have there been any improvements in costs, are you able to beat up your contractors a little bit further to improve returns? I was wondering if you can also talk about I guess on a delta basis what the impact would be of the removal of NED and Palmetto on the 2017 budget? I realize that obviously that has not been presented, but just what the delta of what you would have expected to spend on those two projects in 2017?","Steven Kean","I don\u2019t have the 2017 CapEx numbers. I think Palmetto \u2013 and I\u2019m speaking with respect to the backlog, so Palmetto was about $550 million and of course NED was about [$3.3 billion]. So that explains most of the backlog reduction. On the CapEx front, it\u2019s a mix of things. We had some spend for NED in there, but we don\u2019t really have construction spend for NED in 2016.","So that would not have been a huge component of the $3.1 billion and Palmetto was primarily a land acquisition and maybe the start of construction. So it was not just those, it was also \u2013 we got cost reductions; we had other projects that we moved. As we said at the beginning of the year we made some JV assumptions as well.","Richard Kinder","We have one project, the timing has moved out on.","Shneur Gershuni","The cost reductions, is that something that we can see more on a go forward basis, because it was interesting you used the language of improving returns or if that\u2019s just totally about high grading?","Steven Kean","It\u2019s a number of things. So we have seen \u2013 so a lot of our focus now is on build outs of our existing network and we have seen some improvement in returns partly because we\u2019ve made scope refinements and other cost reductions that call it more market oriented, it\u2019s costing less to do things now than it did in the more heated environment and we\u2019ve also added customers to some of our expansions.","One example I\u2019m thinking of is on our Texas Intrastate. So we\u2019re marching \u2013 so in other words, even within an individual project, we\u2019re trying to march returns up by doing those three things: optimizing scope, reducing cost and adding revenue.","Shneur Gershuni","And then I was wondering if you can just sort of turn to Trans Mountain a little bit, I mean obviously you took NED out because of returns issue. At this stage right now, is Trans Mountain at risk for the same thing regardless of what happens on the approval process or are the returns that you expect, you know what, it\u2019s your latest update, does it look \u2013 is it close to your return hurdles, well above your return hurdle and I was wondering if you can comment about some of the comments that the Canadian government made last week with respect specifically to pipelines, do you view that as a positive or do you just sort of continue your focus as this?","Steven Kean","Huge, huge difference between NED and Trans Mountain. Trans Mountain is under contract. That\u2019s an enormous difference. We were fighting to get NED under contract and didn\u2019t get there. Trans Mountain has the contracts in place, 20-year contracts for 93% of the volume and the other 7% is on a 15-year contract. So long term contracts and look the overall picture, I mean, the overall picture in Canada is notwithstanding very, very difficult [net backs] up there, right.","They are taking a very long view, producers are taking a long view and they\u2019re finishing out projects that they\u2019re well into and the oil sands become a very stable source of production. It\u2019s not like the shales where it ramps, you get a high ramp up in the beginning and it falls off rapidly, so there\u2019s an actual projection of an increase in production in Canada. At the same time, the transport options out of Canada are becoming more limited. So our customers still want to do this project and we do too and the returns are good.","Switching to the public opinion or the governmental outlook, I would say just very broadly that the tone of the comments in the public arena up there are improving. I think that there is a recognition that getting Canadian natural resources to points where they can be exported and no longer dependent upon solely the US market is a good thing across Canada. And that\u2019s starting to show up as people are being constructive about, okay, we need to approve projects, we want to approve them with \u2013 we want to have the right conditions and the right process around that approval, but there\u2019s been a switch I think toward, momentum toward getting the project approved.","Now, I\u2019ll say that with an important caveat. We don\u2019t know what their conditions ultimately are going to be in the end and we\u2019ll have to make an assessment of that when it\u2019s all in. We certainly have a good handle on what the NED proposed conditions are going to look like, but we don\u2019t know what if any other conditions may be imposed. So we\u2019re going to have to watch for that very carefully, but we\u2019ve got good returns, good underlying customer support and contractual support and an improving tone, I think, in the in the public sector today.","Shneur Gershuni","And one last final question, if I may. Earnings up year over year and if you sort of take out some of your negative charges related to coal bankruptcies up a little bit more, I was wondering if you can sort of break down how much the delta is due to acquisitions for example like Highland verses some of your growth projects coming online? Is that a good way for us to assess the returns relative to the CapEx that was spent last year?","Steven Kean","I don\u2019t have a breakdown of what is attributable and aggregate to expansions and acquisitions. But I mean I think you can assume it\u2019s probably more than that year over year change.","Kimberly Allen Dang","But I think you can also just include the capital from the acquisitions in your denominator you\u2019re trying to get a return. We think about our acquisitions as investing capital and it\u2019s important to get returns on that capital as on the expansion CapEx.","Shneur Gershuni","Absolutely. I was just more trying to figure out if the returns were higher from organic versus your acquisitions and so forth?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Generally that is the case.","Steven Kean","Yes, generally yes. In the acquisition context, you look a little differently at something that\u2019s already up and running, already producing cash flow versus a start from scratch investment and an expansion where you\u2019re going to be putting money out before you see the cash in and you\u2019ve got construction risk and other things to take into account. So you generally aim for higher return.","Operator","Next question is coming from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Brandon Blossman","I\u2019ll start smaller line item, but interesting nevertheless, I think. NGPL, there\u2019s a little bit of balance sheet support there during the quarter, any incremental color available on how that balance sheet progresses over time on a look forward basis and EBITDA expectations as we move through the year into next year and maybe some incremental contracts of that pipe?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Generally, I mean, we contributed $311.5 million. That contribution is the original $3.3 billion expansion CapEx budgeted, it is in the $2.9 billion revised. So all taken into account and our guidance generally versus 2015, NGPL\u2019s EBITDA is increasing as a result of some of the expansion projects that it is bringing on line.","Brandon Blossman","And Kim, any expectation of incremental support there or does it look good on a go forward basis?","Kimberly Allen Dang","No expectation for further contributions in 2016. And in 2017 and beyond, we\u2019ll just have to evaluate that as we get there.","Brandon Blossman","And then I think Steve you mentioned some other alternatives to getting gas to the northeast other than the Northeast Direct, is there anything that we could look to or think about in terms of alternate strategies there or incremental projects that may be possible?","Steven Kean","I\u2019ll give you a couple things, but then \u2013 and Tom if you have anything to add. I mean, I think we haven\u2019t even \u2013 we\u2019ve just barely started those discussions and so it\u2019s just too early to give you anything that\u2019s very specific. I do think that one general observation is that the NED project had scale and so the tariff was better likely than what smaller project development tariffs would be. So it\u2019s not likely to \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be anything that\u2019s going to add up in the end to an NED size project. It\u2019ll be bits and pieces here and there. Tom, is that...","Tom Martin","Yes, that\u2019s a fair assessment. I mean, we\u2019ll just have to work with particularly our LDC customers and see what we can do on an expansion of the existing [PTP] system and see if there\u2019s something there that works. But probably there is need both in the near term and ultimately we believe in the long term in the region, but we\u2019ll just try to scale up with that demand as it develops.","Brandon Blossman","And then as a follow up on that one, this is a big picture question, not Kinder specific, but just generally about Northeast infrastructure, any comments that you care to put out there in terms of projects that are needed, but contrasted against producer balance sheets and the ability to kind of backstop those projects, do you see any issues over the next two or three years in terms of getting gas out of the basin?","Steven Kean","I think it\u2019s obviously harder for producers to commit and we\u2019re seeing that in our business to commit to large expansions, to move gas out of the basin. I think on the other side of the \u2013 the other end of the pipe, I mean, we think and a lot of other third parties have pointed out that the New England market needs natural gas and needs additional natural gas. And so we think that need is already there.","But there is a regulatory process that has to get sorted out up there for how the power part of the business is going to procure the needs for their generating assets. And that\u2019s been a work in progress and who knows when they ultimately get that resolved. So there\u2019s definitely less producer push activity for anything large. And we think on the demand side infrastructure is still needed, but they\u2019ve got to come to terms with how it can get contracted for.","Operator","The next question on queue is coming from Brian Gamble of Simmons & Company.","Brian Gamble","I wanted to start on the NED project and if you just finished up chatting about that, when you mentioned essentially the commitment level is not enough from the electric customers, was there any single reason Steve that you can point to is kind of the biggest reason for non-commitment and then any color you want to give on why that one specific customer that you mentioned went a different direction would obviously be helpful, just to get a little flavor for what\u2019s going on up in that market?","Steven Kean","I\u2019m not sure I want to get into that customer\u2019s particular thinking and thought process and the choice they made. I think that the main thing from our standpoint is we needed that and we needed additional sign up. And the insight into why we didn\u2019t get it, we don\u2019t think it had anything to do with the quality the project, it\u2019s a good quality project.","We think it relates to the thing I closed the last answer with which is that the processes up there just have not fully formed in a way that will allow the electric generation load that needs firm natural gas infrastructure on a long term basis to get approved and costs passed through. And so I think those are the two things that really kept us from getting where we needed to go on the electric part of the business, not because that was in theory already in our proposal.","Brian Gamble","And then on the impact to the 2016 outlook, you walked through the Eagle Ford volumes and where they\u2019re hitting your system. Stepping back from that, why do you think those volumes are lower? Do you think from your previous expectation it\u2019s lower activity level in the basin or do you think you\u2019re getting lower contribution from existing wells, so the decline curves are higher or is it a combination?","Steven Kean","It\u2019s really lower activity. I mean I think the rig count there is 40% below what we were looking at and thinking about in October. And so it doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t come back at some point, there\u2019s oil window, there\u2019s an NGL window and all this is associated production, the gas that\u2019s coming out is associated gas. But I think that takes commodity price recovery for people to come back and start deploying rigs and completing wells and the rest of it.","Richard Kinder","It\u2019s a nationwide phenomenon. I think we gave figures at the start which you might get again, the decline built in oil...","Steven Kean","Oil was down 28% from its peak, gas 15% and so there are big declines. I mean, again I think KMCC\u2019s resilience has been surprising and it\u2019s really driven by the fact and you see this in the Bakken too that there are some places which are really core that there\u2019s still some activity going on and that\u2019s kept KMCC at relatively lofty volume levels comparatively, but the overall basin is in decline and will be until there\u2019s price recovery that draws the rigs back out.","Brian Gamble","And what type of rig changes are you expecting from where we are today that\u2019s baked into the new guidance?","Steven Kean","We just assumed that things did not improve and built in kind of an observed decline rate going forward and so we didn\u2019t \u2013 so our numbers don\u2019t translate into rig counts or numbers just like a continued decline rate, an extrapolation from current decline rate.","Brian Gamble","So I\u2019d assume that Eagle Ford production from current levels continues to degrade throughout the year?","Steven Kean","Yes.","Brian Gamble","And then you touched on some of the progress from a JV standpoint, you gave a little color there, really just wanted to kind of touch on big picture, nothing specific, but the general attitude of third parties since the beginning of the year, any color you can give us on any changes that you\u2019ve seen, any improvements, people that are more pessimistic than they were, what direction are they trending?","Richard Kinder","I think all we can say is that the response to our JVs has been positive. And as Steve said, we anticipate getting completed what we talked about earlier in the year and what we have in our book.","Operator","The next question on queue is coming from the line of Darren Horowitz of Raymond James.","Darren Horowitz","Two quick questions for me. Kim, the first one on gas pipes, regarding that contract renewal deterioration that you discussed a few quarters ago, if you back out the Eagle Ford and the SNG expansion project issues, how much of that 2% segment profit shift is coming from areas where re-contracting is an issue like in the Rockies on either WIC or CIG?","Kimberly Allen Dang","So you\u2019re asking about the 2% versus our plan down for the year?","Darren Horowitz","Right.","Kimberly Allen Dang","There is maybe less than 10% that\u2019s coming out of the Rockies pipes and it\u2019s primarily associated with CIG.","Darren Horowitz","And outside of any of the intrastate systems, just across the aggregate asset landscape, is there any other material re-contracting work or otherwise that we should be watching over the next 12 months?","Steven Kean","I think I\u2019ll probably refer \u2013 in our conference presentation, I think we had a sensitivity over the years that this would be \u2013 I think this was actually in the appendix, right.","Richard Kinder","Darren, we have those numbers in, here it is, yes, so 2017 total TPG and this is stated in terms of our share of re-contracting exposure, 0.7% 2017 and 1.3% 2018. And I think, look, that\u2019s probably attributed a fair amount to the Rockies assets.","Darren Horowitz","And then last question either for you Steve or Rich, with regard to this common theme of being focused on return for equity holders here and obviously recognizing the ability to fund 100% of the growth projects with retained cash for the next few years that being at the top of the priority list, what is the quantitative target on leverage that you\u2019re looking to achieve before you consider enhancing that equity value and also your preference between share buybacks, dividend increases or maybe a balance between both?","Richard Kinder","Well, let me answer the first question first and that is we remain consistent with what we said previously that as we promised the rating agencies we will be in the range of 5.5 going down to 5 times debt to EBITDA and we would anticipate achieving the bottom end of that range on a going forward basis.","With regard to the second thing that will be a decision that we will make as that cash flow comes to fruition. And at that time, we would just look at all the factors and see what makes sense. I think it\u2019s an enviable position to be and I feel that way as a large shareholder. And we\u2019ll look at it. If it makes the most sense to buy back shares at that time, we will buy them back.","I can tell you if the prices are where it is today, $19, we would buy it back. But we\u2019ll see where the price is and see what the market looks like and whether we benefit our shareholders in a better way by buying back their shares or by raising the dividend. But we\u2019ll have the capacity to do either one if we want to do that once we get more funding of our capital projects done and once we get our balance sheet in shape we want to get it in.","Operator","The next question on queue will come from the line of Kristina Kazarian of Deutsche Bank.","Kristina Kazarian","Thanks for the update on the backlog numbers. From my mind, it makes sense on those removals. But when I\u2019m taking that lower backlog now and thinking about looking in a little longer term towards 2017 and especially with your comments you just made Rich in terms of getting to that 5 times number, do I now have line of sight on getting to that maybe in 2017 time frame or am I thinking a little too ahead of myself there?","Richard Kinder","We\u2019ll just see how everything comes together and we want to get these joint ventures closed, we want to look at all of the high grade, we want to see exactly what comes out over the remainder of the year. But certainly, we\u2019re getting closer to getting to that happy sun meadow where we can afford to make those choices.","Kristina Kazarian","And then when I am in that happy sun meadow at the end of 2017 on my numbers that means in 2018 I could have those conversations which you mentioned in the beginning of the call more strategically around growth than buybacks or deciding out on longer term additional incremental projects and stuff like that, right?","Richard Kinder","I think that\u2019s right.","Kristina Kazarian","And then my next question is we\u2019ve had a bunch of conversations with peer \u2013 or you had a bunch of peers out there as well talking about contract written negotiations [in lines of] maybe given up on fees in return for longer term contracts or acreage dedication, can you just touch on what you guys are seeing on your side?","Steven Kean","Interestingly, we\u2019re kind of in a net positive right now on the contract renegotiation front. We went through a process in our Highland midstream assets of \u2013 I think the easiest way to think about it is we had a deal to enable us to hook up more production out there and that was advantageous to the producers as well as to us.","We fixed our fees and took commodity exposure off and the producer wanted that, wanted to have the commodity upside. But the bottom line for us is we improved our position on a 2016 basis and improved our fee recoveries on those renegotiated contracts. So we\u2019re up so far this year. Now, other customers do approach us in the gas group occasionally on contract restructurings.","So far we haven\u2019t had to do anything that we didn\u2019t want to do, meaning finding something that had mutual benefit, finding incremental revenues that we could \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, incremental volumes that we could put on. At the same time, we made some concession that they wanted. So I think they\u2019ve been generally win-win situations, Tom, and so I think a pretty good story so far for us.","Tom Martin","And we\u2019ve done some credit enhancements.","Steven Kean","We\u2019ve done credit enhancements as part of the trade too.","Kristina Kazarian","And can you maybe talk in terms of credit enhancements, I know you mentioned earlier about conversations with customers asking them to put some more collateral, just how those are going, have you had any resistance on that side or just any color on that?","Steven Kean","We\u2019ve pulled a lot of collateral and we\u2019ve also done some other alternative things. We have interactions with customers sometimes in a number of places where we can put netting arrangements in place, for example. Some of our producers, the cash flows through us before we net their recovery out and so we have other ways of enhancing our credit position.","And I think to me at least the instructive number is what I said. We net everything through comp all of our collateral up, look at our position and the underlying value of the capacity. If the customer decided they didn\u2019t want it and went into bankruptcy, we see our credit concern list amounting to about 5% of revenue and about half of that is mitigated. And as I said, that already included the Peabody and so that\u2019s now out of our forecast. So the going forward number is very small.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin","Just on Elba, can you just walk us through the milestones that we should be looking for? And I think you said that you pushed out some of the timing on the CapEx for this project this year.","Steven Kean","The big upcoming milestone is May when we expect to get our FERC certificate and a milestone that just recently passed that we, I think, mentioned in the investor conference is we \u2013 well, it\u2019s announced publicly, so our contract with IHI, so they\u2019ll be our engineering procurement and construction contractor. That\u2019s a good milestone for us to get behind us that takes care of a lot of the construction risk. So we\u2019re looking for our FERC authorization upcoming in the next month and we have our EPC contract behind us.","Ted Durbin","And what do you need still left on the FERC certificate, you have the EA, I think, but what\u2019s left exactly?","Steven Kean","So they circulate it for inter-agency comment and we had hoped that, in fact, Kim mentioned the delay in \u2013 the impact of the delay on our Elba Express and SNG expansions that are hurting the south pipeline group in 2016. What happened essentially is FERC put together all of the \u2013 on the same timeline, all of the certificate discussions. So we ended up with that delay as those projects were dragged into the overall Elba conversation, I guess, you\u2019d say.","What they\u2019re doing right now is they\u2019re getting inter-agency commentary. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time with those agencies. We think we\u2019ve addressed, we think that the concerns are largely addressed and that\u2019s the part of the process that they\u2019re in now. So we do expect to get a 7C certificate in May.","Ted Durbin","And then if I can just ask, again just coming back to the JVs, there\u2019s something you\u2019re still pushing forward there even though you\u2019ve dropped the backlog a lot, I guess, at some point we are going to run into a lack of growth potentially given delays in Trans Mountain and what not, how are you thinking philosophically about, do you back off of that if anything else falls out of the backlog, wanting to JV these projects. And then if you can give us a sense of the returns that your JV partners would look for on an unlevered basis?","Steven Kean","I\u2019m not sure I can give you one of the latter other than to emphasize what Rich said, which is there\u2019s a lot of interest out there, so there is a fair amount of competition for people wanting to invest in these. We\u2019re maintaining flexibility. We think that the JVs that we\u2019re pursuing do make sense and making sense in two ways, one is getting someone else to share the capital burden on the development end of it, but also we do believe that we will see a nice promote, nice compensation if you will for having originated the project and that helps boost our return on the capital that we do deploy. So in other words, Ted, I think we think that these make, the ones that we\u2019re pursuing make sense and we expect to continue to pursue them.","Operator","The next question on queue will come from the line of Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers Investment Research.","Craig Shere","Not to beat a dead horse with regards to the JV funding, but Steve, I think in your earlier answer to Jeremy, you kind of noted that NED was obviously expected to have some JV partner CapEx support. With NED gone, can you quantify how much in terms of as yet uncommitted but budgeted JV dollars are left in the budget?","Steven Kean","We haven\u2019t really included, we did attempt to get JV partners on NED, but we never really included that in our outlook. As I said at the conference we had kind of two placeholder numbers, two placeholder JV opportunities and it won\u2019t be \u2013 it won\u2019t match perfectly what we had in the original outlook in terms of which ones we pursue. But we expect to meet our targets for what the JVs will do for us this year in terms of our capital, a reduced capital spend.","Craig Shere","And in terms of juicing the returns on CapEx you do spend because of your value you get from originating the projects with JV partners, do you see this simply taking projects already earning 15% plus and juicing it all the more or do you see it taking projects that initially may not have been up to those standards, but can be pushed to those standards with the JVs?","Steven Kean","I mean, I think we first start by looking at what we need to do for our balance sheet metrics, but we do keep an eye on what the longer term impact of the JV decision is. And we are picking projects that I think are attractive returns and that other people will find to be attractive returns, but we think that we can make better use of the capital that comes in from their participation in the JV, meaning them buying into the project and funding the CapEx. We can redeploy that in any of the ways that Rich mentioned better. So I think it\u2019s kind of both things that you are saying.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from John Edwards of Credit Suisse.","John Edwards","Just a couple quick ones for me, I\u2019m just curious how much \u2013 what was \u2013 maybe I missed it, what the write up amount was for NED and Palmetto?","Kimberly Allen Dang","It\u2019s about $100 million on NED and it was $65 million \u2013 $64 million on Palmetto.","Steven Kean","Pretax.","John Edwards","And so you\u2019re looking at that in terms of \u2013 how does that flow through on your budget, is it you\u2019re looking it as kind of a non-cash item or is it hitting the EBITDA budget, is that part of the 3%, how should I think about that?","Kimberly Allen Dang","We\u2019ve set that aside as a certain item. And so you can see that on the certain items on the project write off, there\u2019s $170 million and I just gave you $165 million of it.","John Edwards","And then I\u2019m just curious you know, you brought the CapEx number down to $2.9 billion, is the bias here to reduce the CapEx budget more or I mean do you think you\u2019re going to go forward here around this level?","Steven Kean","I think we believe this is a reasonable estimate here, but we will keep looking at it. And ideally what we\u2019d like to do John is keep finding ways to save cost, improve scope, add customers to project to boost returns. So we\u2019ll continue to look at it to improve it. We are authorizing small additional projects, they\u2019re very small, they have very good returns that build up on our existing network, but this number reflects all of that along with the reductions that we\u2019ve been talking about on the call. So I think this is a reasonable estimate. There\u2019s the possibility of taking a little bit more out of it, but this is a reasonable estimate to use.","John Edwards","As far as taking a little bit more out of it, I mean do you think that\u2019s going to come more from project deferrals or more cost reductions, how are you thinking there?","Steven Kean","I think it will be more within the project. In other words, we look at the project and it gets delayed or deferred or we find a cost saving in it.","John Edwards","And then with crude oil prices improving here obviously off mid quarter, we\u2019re up about 50% or so, I mean what\u2019s your read on customer mood now? I mean, is it cautiously optimistic, people still resisting project proposals or what\u2019s the read through you guys you\u2019re getting?","Steven Kean","I think that they\u2019re being cautious about their next move. I think they want to see generally they wanted to see some additional recovery and see some stability in that recovery. I also think that as a group they\u2019ve made themselves very, very flexible. I mean they are updating their outlook and updating their decision making. It\u2019s no longer an annual process.","It seems like it\u2019s a biweekly process or something now as they\u2019re looking at things which suggests that when they do decide to turn things back up, they\u2019ll be able to turn it back up relatively quickly. But look, as I said before, people signing up for a long term multi hundred million dollar or a billion dollar infrastructure on the producer side, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s in the cards in the near term.","Operator","Next question on queue will come from the line of Becca Followill of US Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Believe it or not, there\u2019s still questions. Broad Run was delayed a year, can you guys talk about that a little bit, why the delay on that project?","Steven Kean","That was the Broad Run expansion project, so we have the first tranche of Broad Run in and that\u2019s up and running. We talked to our primary customer there, Antero, about whether they still wanted to pursue the expansion project. They did, but they were interested in and we were interested in a delay in it. So we mutually agreed to a delay.","Becca Followill","And then along the same veins of the answer to the last question, in your CO2 business, at what point do you start to put capital back to work and what kind of commodity prices do you need to see?","Steven Kean","We have capital going to work there right now. We have just elevated the return criteria to, as Kim said, 15% unlevered after tax or better. We actually approved a project today that had a 43% return. These are small. The capital program on CO2 is now just a little over $200 million, but we continue to approve small program spends in the CO2 group.","And I think that the easiest way to think about it, Becca, is where we\u2019ve got an existing flood that\u2019s up and running and so what we\u2019re doing is using shared facilities, maybe adding an injector, converting a current producing well to an injector, drilling a new producing well, we\u2019ve got all the other facilities, all the central facilities in place. The return on the incremental capital spend that we make is still attractive.","Now, if you\u2019re talking about a brand new CO2 flood and getting one of those started, that\u2019s ways off. I think you need to see a fair amount of oil price recovery before you start to see 50, 55, you need to see significant oil price recovery before you start to see that.","Becca Followill","And then last question on interest expense, certain item of $69 million in interest expense, can you help us out with what that was?","Kimberly Allen Dang","On the interest expense is that the fair value accounting, okay, so Becca, when we \u2013 and that should be a recurring certain item that happens every quarter. When we acquire other companies and assume their debt, we have to fair value that debt. And once we fair value that debt, then the interest expense that we recognize is not the same as the interest expense that is on the note and the interest expense that we pay. And so we classified the difference as a certain item.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from the line of Matthew Russell of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Russell","I understand the stance on funding CapEx through cash flows, but just given the recent strength that we\u2019ve had in the credit markets, any reason you don\u2019t consider tapping the debt markets that have had $3 billion you have maturing in 2017?","Kimberly Allen Dang","We\u2019ll continue to watch the market and if we think it makes sense we may do that at some point. But obviously we don\u2019t need to.","Steven Kean","I think that we don\u2019t need to, but we have the ability to if it looks advisable.","Matthew Russell","And then just thinking about the leveraging strategy more broadly, sitting at 5.5 times at the end of this year with $42 million in debt, the simple math is you could take out $4.5 million of debt and that would get you to 5 times or you could grow $900 million of EBITDA. How do you see that mix between debt pay down and EBITDA growth playing out to get you to that 5 times?","Kimberly Allen Dang","I think it\u2019ll be a combination of the fact that we\u2019re finding everything with 100% retaining cash flows, so 100% equity and then EBITDA that comes on line from the projects.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from the line of Danilo Juvane of BMO Capital.","Danilo Juvane","With respect to the 6.7 times multiple, are there opportunities for you guys to continue to realize cost reductions and scope improvements to get that even lower?","Steven Kean","I don\u2019t think they\u2019re dramatic, right, but we continue \u2013 we look at our projects every month within the business unit, certain of them are looked at every week and we\u2019re pressing our vendors fairly hard to get concessions on construction costs, equipment and materials. We have found scope that it turns out on closer examination we don\u2019t need or we don\u2019t need right away and so we can either defer or eliminate those.","And it\u2019s just part of our normal process too. I mean, we ramped it up a little bit here, but I mean it\u2019s just part of the normal review process to look for those. But they\u2019re not huge, they may be material to an individual project, but not huge in the overall scheme of things. But I think we\u2019ll keep finding them.","Danilo Juvane","Last question for me, what was the CO2 CapEx for the quarter?","Steven Kean","CO2 CapEx for the quarter, hang on, it looks like about $55 million.","Operator","Next question on queue is coming from the line of Chris Sighinolfi, we have Corey Goldman of Jefferies.","Corey Goldman","Just a quick follow up to Shneur\u2019s question on TMX. So it looks as though NED pushed its final approval back seven months. Steve, can you just confirm it\u2019s just a one quarter delay on the in-service there?","Steven Kean","We\u2019re still aiming for end of \u2013 think of it as very end of 2019. So we had been looking at late third quarter and yeah it\u2019s about a three month delay.","Corey Goldman","And so I think this was a question asked on the third quarter earnings call, but given that some of the shippers do have an opt out if cost begin to creep, is there a specified date that you guys have in mind in which you want to decide go, no-go before or do you think shippers will have a go, no-go decision if and when those costs begin to creep up?","Steven Kean","Let me lay out what the process is. So in the \u2013 we\u2019ll be getting \u2013 again we have \u2013 we\u2019re looking at costs right now, but we\u2019ll have our final conditions and know what all of our obligations are going to be, we think December, January, right. I mean, it\u2019s December for the federal process to conclude and I think again out in that same time frame we will understand where we are with British Columbia. And then after that, we owe our customers an updated cost estimate. So you\u2019re talking about \u2013 your question about timing that\u2019s really kind of a first quarter of next year event.","We don\u2019t have an update on the 6.8 because we\u2019re still evaluating what we think the projects are going to cost us, what the project is going to cost us and it will be a bit dependent upon the conditions. I think a couple things. One is that there is some cost pressure, the Canadian dollar has weakened relative to the US dollar. A lot of the goods and services are provided in US dollar terms, so there\u2019s been some pressure there. There have been some conditions that we\u2019ve agreed to and that have been added over time which has put some pressure on.","But I think at the end of the day what matters is do the customers want the project and we still have very strong interest from our shippers in the project and we even have interest from shippers who are not currently customers, potential customers who are not currently shippers on the project. So we talk about this all the time, but I think this is still a project that our customers want.","Corey Goldman","And then Kim, if you can, can you just \u2013 I think you guys are alluding to some movement in the CO2 volumes as it relates to 2016 and perhaps beyond, can you just provide us an update on the hedges and then the price there from the analysts data if any?","Kimberly Allen Dang","So in 2017, we have 51% hedged at $68 and 2018 it\u2019s 36% at $72; 2019, it\u2019s 24% at $60; and in 2020, it\u2019s 6% at $49.","Corey Goldman","And 2016?","Kimberly Allen Dang","This year, this is for the remainder of 2016, we\u2019re 77% hedged at [$63.55].","Corey Goldman","And then just if you can, last question for me, if you can remind me, of the $14.1 billion growth CapEx that you still have, how much of that considered overhead?","Steven Kean","5%.","Corey Goldman","Is that 5%?","Steven Kean","Yes, 5%.","Corey Goldman","So it\u2019s not a huge amount, but would you recommend capitalizing that at 6.7 times multiple you\u2019re referring to kind of including that in there?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Yes.","Steven Kean","We\u2019re including that.","Kimberly Allen Dang","Yes, we\u2019re including that one, we are using the full $14.1 billion which includes overhead, less the CO2 CapEx. And then that\u2019s the 6.7 times multiple on that capital.","Operator","The next question on queue is coming from Ross Payne of Wells Fargo.","Ross Payne","And Rich, thank you so much for your clarification on the leverage. And you guys are obviously going to get to 5.5 times by the end of the year, moving towards the 5.0. Can you speak to what is the progression for 2017 and 2018, when do you need to be at 5.0, what do you expect in 2017 in terms of your leverage metrics as well?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Ross, we haven\u2019t done 2017 plan yet and so I don\u2019t have a projection for you for exactly when we will get to the 5.0 time. But I think over the next couple of years, we will get to the target and that\u2019s what Rich was referencing at that point that we will make a decision what to do with excess cash flow beyond that point.","Ross Payne","Do the credit agencies have certain levels that they have in mind for 2017 and 2018, or they just thrown out of 2016 and then a general migration to the 5?","Kimberly Allen Dang","Let me tell you I think the rating agencies based on our conversations with them are comfortable with our current rating and our current outlook. And I think at this point we are funding 100% equity because we\u2019re using cash flow. And what we\u2019ve said is we\u2019re going to use that cash flow to fund our CapEx and to improve our balance sheet.","And until we get that balance sheet improved to the 5.0 target, we\u2019re not going to do other things with that cash flow. So we will absent our cash flow going away which as we said every year for the last 18 years that we have very stable fee based cash flow, we will have that cash flow, we will improve our leverage metrics and once that happens then we will look at other uses of our cash.","Operator","At this time, we have no question on queue.","Richard Kinder","Okay. Well, thank you all very much for listening in and have a good evening.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the end of today's presentation we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded, if you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Executive Chairman of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Rich Kinder","Thank you, Brendon. Before we begin, as usual, I'd like to remind you that today's earnings releases by KMI and KML and this call includes forward-looking and financial outlook statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and applicable Canadian provincial and territorial securities laws, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures.","Before making any investment decisions, we strongly encourage you to read our full disclosures on forward-looking and financial outlook statements and use of non-GAAP financial measure set forth at the end of KMI's and KML's earnings releases, and to review our latest filings with the SEC and Canadian provincial and territorial securities commissions, for a list of important material assumptions, expectations, and risk factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated and described in such forward-looking and financial outlook statements.","Before turning the call over to Steve and the management team, I usually begin these quarterly earnings calls with a few words about our financial strategy at Kinder Morgan. I hope by now we've made it very clear that we are managing our assets and the substantial cash flow they generate in a financially responsible way that maximizes returns to our shareholders. ","That said, it's important to understand and appreciate what underpins that cash flow, and whether that business will continue to generate strong and growing returns with the opportunity to expand our asset base.","As you know, majority of our segment earnings before DD&A comes from our natural gas segment, and through our 70,000 plus miles of natural gas pipelines, we handle about 40% of all the gas consumed in this country.","In addition, the bulk of our current and projected capital expansion dollars are also devoted to the natural gas segment. We are very bullish on the future of natural gas from both a supply and demand perspective. Natural gas is critical to our American economy to satisfy the growing energy needs around the world, and very importantly, to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner.","Our optimism is borne out by actual results over the last few years and by the consensus estimate of those firms and governmental agencies which follow the energy field most closely. Sometimes we lose sight of the actual facts involved, so looking first through the rearview mirror U.S. demand in 2018 was up 12% from 2017 and 44% above the demand of a decade earlier. 2019 is shaping up to be another strong year.","Looking forward, as we previously said U.S. demand is projected to grow by over 30% between now and 2030 that demand growth is being driven by L&G, power and industrial demand and by exports to Mexico.","Turning to the supply side, the U.S. is projected by 2025 to be producing one quarter of all the natural gas in the world, and accounting for over 50% of the growth in supply -- in global supply by that year.","Now look I\u2019m aware of Mark Twain saying that making predictions is very difficult, particularly when they concern the future. But I believe that under almost any scenario natural gas is a winner for years to come. Connecting these vast supplies -- these vast U.S. supplies to growing demand markets will drive new infrastructure and higher utilization of existing assets.","KMI is very well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, especially in Texas and Louisiana where our extensive network of pipelines is very well situated to serve the rapidly growing LNG export and petrochemical facilities. That's a big reason why we feel good about the long-term future of this company.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve. ","Steve Kean","All right thanks, Rich. We will be updating you on both KMI and KML this after afternoon I am going to start with KMI and turn it over to our president Kim Dang, to give you the update on our segment performance, our CFO David Michels will take you through the numbers, Dax Sanders will update you on KML number, and then we\u2019ll take your questions.","The summary on KMI is this we\u2019ve been adhering and continue to adhere to the principles that we've laid out for you. We have a strong balance sheet having met our approximately 4.5 times debt to EBITDA target and with rating upgrades now from all three ratings agencies.","We're maintaining our capital discipline through our return criteria, a good track record of execution and by self-funding our investments. We're returning value to shareholders with the 25% year-over-year dividend increase and we continue to find attractive growth opportunities. We have a strong balance sheet, capital discipline returning value to our shareholders and finding additional growth opportunities those are the principles we operate by.","Our performances this year so far has been solid and we project it to be solid. We\u2019ve had headwinds on commodity prices in our CO2 segment and we\u2019ve had a delay in the in service of our Elba LNG facility. Also as we said at the beginning of the year, we did not budget for rate case settlements resulting from the 501-G process, but we are pleased with the settlements we were able to obtain.","Now we had tailwinds in terms of lower interest rates, and good performance in our west, north and midstream gas groups helping to offset these negatives. Putting it all together, as we said last quarter, we expect to be slightly under plan on an EBITDA basis, but on plan from a DCS standpoint.","So here are some updates on a few key projects starting with our Permian Natural Gas Pipeline projects. Our customers are anxious to have us get their gas out of the Permian so they can get their oil and NGLs out as well. We got two projects to get the gas out Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway and we are in discussions on a possible third pipeline, which were calling Permian Pass. ","GCX and Permian Highway are each about 2 BCF a day of capacity, both are secured by long-term contracts and both are in the execution stage. GCX is expected to be in service slightly ahead of schedule. The original schedule was October 1 of this year, we now expect to be at the full 2 BCF a day the in service level in the last week to 10 days of September. The pipe is in the ground, there is still commissioning work going on on the compressor and meter stations, but our expectation is for a slightly early in service date.","Permian Highway is receiving pipe and acquiring right of way, we hired our pipeline and construction firms and we are on schedule for a completion in October 2020. We had a significant court decision last month, which essentially affirms the existing eminent domain process that has been used in use for four decades in the state of Texas. Felt confident in our legal position, but is nevertheless a good thing to have prevailed in the case.","So both of our current projects are on schedule, both projects are at attractive returns, and both projects bring us additional opportunities in our downstream pipelines. Combined, they bring 4 BCF a day of incremental gas to a system that moves about 5 BCF a day today. Those projects bring opportunities for downstream expansion and optimization as we find homes for all that incremental gas through our connectivity with LNG facilities, Texas Gulf Coast power, industrial and petchem demand.","We are working with customers on a third 2 BCF a day pipeline the Permian Pass pipeline. This is a work in progress. It's not in the backlog at this point, certainly, but it is moving along. These Permian projects show us taking advantage of a very positive situation. There's large supply growth in Texas, and large demand growth in Texas, we can bridge the two and connect to our premier Texas Intrastate Pipeline Network and stay entirely within the state of Texas, where we have more commercial flexibility. As we pointed out at the conference this year 70% of natural demand -- natural gas demand growth between now and 2030 is expected to be in Louisiana and Texas, and our systems are well positioned to benefit from that.","On another key project Elba, our Elba liquefaction facility, we are closing in on in service. We are now mechanically complete on 4 of the 10 MMLS units. The cold box on the first unit is now uniformly cold at cryogenic temperatures and we are ramping up the volume. We are producing LNG unevenness in the temperatures between the bottom and the top of the cold box had been plaguing our startup over the last several weeks. We are now past that and ramping up to full service.","We expect to be in service on unit one soon and that unit represents 70% of project revenue. I'd like to be more definitive about the exact in-service date. But it is a function of whether we have to suspend the production of LNG for additional troubleshooting.","The delay we've experienced is certainly unwelcome, but the risk allocation between us and our contractor and our customer provides significant protection and mitigates the impact to our internal rate of return. The impact of the delay is expected to be approximately 100 basis points unlevered after tax on a still attractive return. We'll make a separate announcement when we have the first unit in service.","Also of note we added $400 million worth of projects to the backlog this quarter, partially offsetting $800 million worth of projects that are placed into service or removed from the backlog. Most of what we removed from the backlog was in CO2 segment, we remain - our team in CO2 remains very disciplined here and we reduced capital spend when we find the economics do not justify the expenditure. The backlog now stands at $5.7 billion. And most of the new capital investment is in natural gas, which now makes up nearly 80% of our total backlog.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim. ","Kim Dang ","Hey, thanks Steve. Natural gas had another outstanding quarter, it was up 7% and the underlying market fundamentals remain very strong. Between 2018 and 2019 natural gas demand is expected to increase by over 5 BCF a day. Almost 60% of KMI segment earnings before DD&A come from our natural gas business and of the natural gas consumed in the U.S. we move about 40% on our pipeline. So the fundamentals underlying our largest business are very strong.","Transport volumes on our transmission pipes increased approximately 3.1 BCF a day second quarter versus the second quarter of 2018 are about 10%. This is the sixth quarter in a row in which volumes exceeded the comparable period by 10% or more. If you look at where these volume showed up in our transmission pipe PNG volumes were up 760 million cubic feet a day due to increased Permian volumes and increased California demand.","KMLA volumes were up 670 million cubic feet a day due to LNG exports. And overall for Kinder Morgan's deliveries to LNG export plants increased approximately 1.4 BCF a day. CIG volumes were approximately 500 million a day due to increased DJ Basin production and colder weather. Ruby volumes were up 370 million cubic feet a day due to colder West Coast weather and outages in the Pacific Northwest. And rig volumes were up 370 a day due to increased DJ production.","On gathering assets, volumes were up approximately 16% or 450 million cubic feet a day and that was primarily due to higher volumes on our Haynesville and our Eagle Ford gathering system. ","Overall natural gas wellhead volumes out of the key basins that we serve continue to increase. Permian Natural Gas wellhead volumes increased approximately 30% versus the second quarter of 2018, Haynesville increased approximately 27%, Bakken increased approximately 27%, and Eagle Ford increased approximately 5%. ","Overall, the higher utilization on our systems a lot of which came without the need to spend significant capital resulted in nice bottom line growth for the segment in the quarter and longer term will drive expansion opportunities as the market continues to grow in our [indiscernible] capacity. ","Our product segment was down in the quarter slightly. Here increased contributions from our Southeast Refined Products Terminal, our Central Florida Pipeline, our Double Eagle Pipeline, and our Condensate splitter were more than offset by the lower contribution from KMCC and SFPP. Volumes on KMCC were actually up 12%, but that was more than offset by lower rates. SFPP was impacted by higher operating expenses. ","Overall crude and condensate volumes were up 2%, refined product volumes were flat in the quarter and EIA refined products volume the estimate is that they were down approximately 0.9% is a little bit better than the national average.","Terminals business was down in the quarter. The liquids business which accounts for about 80% of the segment had nice increases from expansion projects, the largest of which was our baseline thermal expansion projects in Edmonton. We also saw higher throughput and ancillary charges in our Houston ship channel facility.","However, these increases were more than offset by the lease expense in our Edmonton South Terminal which became a third party obligation posts our Trans Mountain sale and impact from historically high water levels on the Mississippi River that resulted in reduced volumes and contributed to off-hire time on our Jones Act tankers.","We added approximately 1.2 million barrels of tankage in the quarter versus the second quarter of 2018. Now it's primarily results with a baseline project and that brings our total leasable capacity to around 89 million barrels. The bulk business was also down in the quarter due to lower volume. Bulk volumes were down approximately 11% due to lower coal, pet coke and steel.","Our CO2 segment was down in the quarter and that was primarily due to lower crude and NGL prices. Our net realized crude oil price was down about $8 a barrel for the quarter and that's largely driven by our mid\/cush basis hedges. NGL prices were down approximately $9 per barrel. On the crude oil production side, volumes were down approximately 2%, primarily due to lower production at Katz and Goldsmith. While cotton production increased 8% versus the second quarter of 2018. But offset substantially below our plan.","The reservoir is processing slower than we expected and until we can determine how to address this issue starting to reduce 2019 capital expenditures associated with this asset. Largely as a result of this decision, free cash flow from our CO2 business has increased by approximately $80 million for 2019 as almost all the production associated with these investments benefited future years.","In CO2 as with all our assets we diligently monitor our investments to make sure that they're going to achieve our projected return. To the extent that we think there's a material risks with its return either take steps to mitigate our downside, or we do not move forward with those investments as we did here.","At SACROC which accounts for almost two-thirds of our current production, production was up 1% in the quarter, and we expect to be above budgeted volumes for the year. So nice current performance in SACROC. When you look at the longer term, the story has also improved. In our mid-year reserve review, SACROC proved reserves increased by about 5.5 million barrels, which represents approximately 33% increase improved reserves. This was driven primarily by increased recovery factors as a result of increased performance.","On our CO2 sales and transport business, it was up slightly in the quarter. And that was driven by an 11% increase in CO2 volumes, which more than offset a 4% decrease in the price.","With that, I'll turn it over to Dave Michels.","David Michels","Thanks, Kim. Today we are declaring a dividend of $0.25 per share, same as last quarter and in line with the budget, $1 per share for the fourth [Technical Difficulty] 25% increase over dividends 2018.","KMI\u2019s adjusted earnings in DCF grew from last year\u2019s second quarter [Technical Difficulty] generated DCF per share $0.50 two times or approximately $560 million in excess of the declared dividends. ","Revenues were down 6% this quarter, compared to the second quarter in 2018. But a decline in cost of sales more than offset our lower revenues that our gross margin was up relative to the prior period. Some of that came from the benefit of non-cash losses on derivative contracts during the second quarter of 2018. We treat as certain items and exclude from our non-GAAP metric. Including certain items gross margin was in line period over period.","Net income available to common stockholders was $518 million, were 388% better than the second quarter of 2018, largely to impairments taken during the second quarter of 2018, which we treat as certain items. Before certain items, net income available to common stockholders was up $34 million or approximately 7%. That includes the benefit of zero preferred dividend payments down from $39 million as a result of the conversion of our preferred equity securities in October of last year. ","Adjusted earnings per share was $0.22 for the quarter, up $0.01 or 5% from the prior period.","Moving on to distributable cash flow performance, our natural gas business, which you've already heard was up nicely $73 million, or 7%. We saw greater performance versus last year across multiple assets. EPNG was up, driven by Permian supply growth, more than offsetting the impacts that that asset received related to our 501-G settlement. We had increased contribution from multiple expansion projects placed in-service, KinderHawk and South Texas GMP assets were up driven by increased volume.","Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline was up due to our Sabine Pass [indiscernible]. And Kim provided the main drivers for our products terminal and CO2 segments. Moving on to our Kinder Morgan Canada segment that was down 100% as a result of our sale of the Trans Mountain pipeline.","G&A expense was lower by $8 million due to greater overhead capitalized growth projects, as well as lower G&A from the Tran Mountain sale. Partially offsetting those was higher pension expenses relative to last year. Those pension expenses that hit G&A or non-cash, can we add them back to our DCF and replace those with our actual cash contribution to our pension fund.","Interest expense was $22 million lower and that was driven by lower debt balance and greater interest capitalized to projects as well. Those are partially offset by a higher LIBOR rate versus last year would impact our interest rate swaps. ","Preferred stock dividends are down $39 million as a result of the conversion of our preferred securities. Cash taxes were higher by $18 million and that\u2019s related to payments at citrus, greater taxable income there versus last year and higher taxes at KML, which Dax will walk through. Those impacts were expected and our cash tax forecast is actually slightly favorable to our budget for the full year.","Sustaining capital was $26 million higher versus the second quarter of 2018, mainly due to pipeline integrity work in our natural gas segments. Again, we have budgeted for greater expenditure [Technical Difficulty] in fact our full year forecast is slightly favorable budget [Technical Difficulty].","Total DCF of $1.128 billion was up $1 million or 1%, to summarize the main drivers greater contributions from our natural gas segments, lower interest expense, preferred stock dividend, mostly offset by our sale of Trans Mountain, lower commodity prices impacting our CO2 segments, higher sustaining CapEx and higher cash tax payments. DCF per share $0.50 per share was in line last quarter, same drivers as DCF, but it includes the impact from the incremental shares that were issued as a result of our preferred security conversion.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter at 4.6 times debt to EBITDA, which is consistent with our budget and slightly higher than where we were at year end at 4.5 times. At the end of the year leverage is forecasted to be 4.6 times, which is just slightly unfavorable to our budget of 4.5 and is consistent with our long-term leverage target of approximately 4.5 times.","As we said last quarter forecast for that full year EBITDA to be slightly lowered than budget or a little less than 2% below budget. Drivers there include the first 501-G impacts, the Elba delay, lower commodity prices impacting CO2, higher pension expenses, partially offset by the very strong Permian supply growth.","All of those impact DCF as well, but DCF includes the benefit of favorable interest expenses expected for the year and it also adds backs the non-cash pension expense. As a result, we expect our full year DCF to be in line with budget.","Items to note on the balance sheet with regard to some of the larger changes from year-end cash has $3.1 billion use, driven by a $1.3 billion pay down of bonds which happen in the first quarter, $800 million distribution to the public AML shareholders and $340 million of Canadian cash taxes related to the sale of Trans Mountain.","Other current liabilities [Technical Difficulty] this is where we booked payable for the public shareholders distribution for the quarter also includes movements in accrued interest and taxes. Long-term debt was down mainly due to us paying off $1.3 billion of bond. Adjusted net debt ended the quarter at $34.8 billion or about flat with last quarter and an increase of $689 million from year-end. Reconcile the quarter change [Technical Difficulty] the $1.128 billion of DCF, had growth capital and contributions to JVs $770 million, paid dividends of $570 million, we have a working capital source of $200 million mainly interest expense accrual that gets us to about flat net debt for the quarter.","To reconcile from year-end, we had about $2.5 billion of DCF, paid $1.52 billion out in growth CapEx and contributions to [Technical Difficulty] paid dividends of $1.20 billion, paid $340 million of taxes [the Mountain sale][ph] and working capital use of approximately $300 million, which were mainly interest payments, bonus payroll and tax very close to [Technical Difficulty] year-to-date. Finally we\u2019re posting or we have posted to our website supplemental earnings information that include an alternative format for our financial presentation, it also includes some commodity hedging information [Technical Difficulty] for your modeling.","Beginning in the third quarter, we plan to use that new format in our earnings release, it represent an enhanced presentation of our financial. For now it just been provided an addition to our standard format so you can [indiscernible] of our implementation [Technical Difficulty]. ","With that, I will turn it back to Steve.","Steve Kean","All right thank you. So turning now to KML, in KML we had strong performance during the quarter, we continue to advance our expansion projects at our Vancouver Works facility. We have a good business here, good midstream assets and a good team and we will continue to manage it and look for opportunities to grow it for the benefit of all of our shareholders.","Dax will give you an update on our financial and commercial performance for the quarter.","Dax Sanders","Thanks, Steve. Before I get into the results, I want to update you on a couple of general business items. First as we announced the KML Board purpose stock repurchase plan that will allow us to repurchase up to 2 million restricted voting shares over the next 12 months, we will use selectively and opportunistically. This is the maximum number of shares allowed under the Canadian normal course issuer bid rules taking into account 10% [Technical Difficulty].","On our announced diesel export project we received material permits and had commenced construction activity. Consistent with previous statements this is an approximately $43 million project that contemplates two distillate tanks with combined storage capacity of 200,000 barrels underpinned by a 20 year take-or-pay contract that we expect to put in service during the first half of 2021.","On the shed six reactivation projects that we have discussed, which as a reminder is an $8 million expansion project at Vancouver Works, we continue to expect to have that in-service in [Technical Difficulty]. ","Now moving forward to the results. Today the KML Board declared a dividend for the second quarter of $0.1625 per restricted voting share and $0.65 annual [Technical Difficulty].","Earnings per restricted voting share from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2019 are $0.12 and that\u2019s derived from approximately $22 million income from continuing operations, which is same as net income. Income from continuing operation was down approximately $2 million versus the same quarter in 2018.","Looking at the largest drivers of that variance, revenue increased across most of KML\u2019s assets and was led by the contribution from the baseline tank and terminal assets coming online, but the increase in revenues was more than offset by the non-recurrence of a gain on the sale of small Edmonton area pipeline asset in 2018 [Technical Difficulty] than the other income expense line and treated as a certain item on the DCF.","DCF from continuing operations for the quarter is $28.3 million, down approximately $7.8 million comparable period in 2018 that reflects coverage of $2.8 million and reflects the DCF payout ratio of approximately [Technical Difficulty]. ","Cash taxes of unfavorable $9 million, as we discussed previously we were not required to make cash tax payments in 2018 for 2018 operations, but rather we\u2019re able to differ them until the first quarter of [Technical Difficulty]. However we're now required to make installments for this year which is driving that year-to-year [Technical Difficulty]. As a relevant [upside] [ph] our ultimate cash tax obligation for 2018 was lower than we expected and as such we expect to refile later in this year form [Technical Difficulty]. ","Looking at the other significant component of the DCF variants segment EBITDA before certain items is up $7.6 million [Technical Difficulty]. Terminal segment up $6.5 million and the pipeline segment up $1 million. Terminal segment was higher due primarily to baseline coming online, which accounted for about 5.4 [Technical Difficulty]. The pipeline segment was higher primarily due to higher revenue on [indiscernible] as a result of the index adjusted rate and timing on volumes.","Finally sustaining capital was negative $3.9 million due to several plant tank inspections that we did in the second quarter that was [Technical Difficulty]. Looking forward as we said in the release, we expect to meet our budget of approximately $213 million of EBITDA and approximately $109 million of [Technical Difficulty]. ","With that just a couple of quick comments on the balance sheet around liquidity situation. We ended the quarter with approximately $33 million cash and significant available liquidity as we only have $35 million drawn out of the $500 million revolving. Our debt the last 12 months adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 1.3 times. However as we said in the past given potential rating agency adjustments on operating leases and other items this ratio is not necessarily indicative of our debt raising capacity at our current ratings.","With that, I will turn it back to Steve. ","Steve Kean","Okay Brandon, if you come back on we will take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Steve Kean","Good afternoon.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi, good afternoon. Good news there with GCX it sounds like coming online early. Just want to touch on a little bit more and see is that pipe able to flow gas even before the compressors are online, could there be line fill where just the force from the plant kind of pushes a certain level of gas through and could you guys get paid on that or how should I think about that line fill that startup process? ","Steve Kean","So this is an over 500 mile pipeline we\u2019re starting the process of packing it, now the pipe is in the ground as I said. The compressor stations are the part that really causes the ramp up to occur. And look commissioning compressor stations can be dicey, we are pretty comfortable with these units and think will be able to get them going and get them ramping up. And -- but it's a process it takes time. And as we look out over the period it\u2019s going to take us to pack the line, ramp up all the compression and get to the 2 BCF. We think will be done that a week to 10 days early that\u2019s kind of what we're looking at.","In the meantime, we will be buying gas, we will be delivering what gas we can deliver. There is some value in that. But we're in a hurry to get this on for our customers and we are moving with all deliberate speed to get it up to full service.","Jeremy Tonet","Got you. That\u2019s helpful, thanks. And realize that Permian Pass being early stages here probably don't want to talk too much about it, but just see what I can gather here and want to see if you could comment on end markets that this would target if this leverage your footprint and you lifted I think the CapEx spend $200 million there is this kind of in there part of that spend what type of product developmental expenses would you be incurring at this point?","Steve Kean","I'll start with the last first. We\u2019re not incurring a lot of developmental expenses; we\u2019re doing a lot of research on the routing and making sure that we\u2019ve got a good route and we think we do have a very good route. I think the easiest way to think about this is, GCX kind of it hits Agua Dulce, which serves Corpus and serves the Mexican market and some industrial demand down in that part of the state. PHP kind of comes into the middle of our system and we\u2019ll serve I\u2019m not talking about shippers here I'm talking about markets, okay, the gas will end up in Freeport and at the LNG facility there as well as industrial demand that's in that area. And the third pipe well, the fourth pipe if you count Whistler, the fourth pipe will go around to East Texas and serve LNG demand around Sabine.","Operator","Our next question is from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Your line is open. ","Shneur Gershuni ","Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just to follow up on the last question on Permian Pass a little bit here. Do you expect to have partners on this project, similar to how you have it with GCX and sort of benefit from the operating leverage once it hits the Eastern part of your system? And I was wondering as part of it can you also talk about the analysis that you're doing I mean, you did note the three other pipes about whether there's enough gas demand or need for a fourth pipe?","Steve Kean","Okay. So like the previous projects, I think it's reasonable to expect a similar pattern, which is that very large shippers will want to participate in the ownership of the pipeline. And we welcome that to a certain extent while we would like to own more of these projects, it's good to have your shippers in there with you, I think.","So I would expect the same -- we would expect that same pattern is going to hold on Permian Pass. And yes, the proof of the demand is in the shipper sign up and expect again kind of another producer push sort of pipeline here, people are looking for opportunities to get that growing associated gas supply out of the Permian so that they can produce their oil and their NGLs too. And the proof will be in the -- from our standpoint, the proof will be in the sign ups.","Now the projections are a need for a 2 BCF a day pipeline really essentially every year, all the way through this fourth pipeline. And then there's some expectation that there will be another one needed beyond that. That's all very, very early, but the supply growth out of the Permian and the expected demand growth, primarily a function of LNG demand is still very robust. And it should translate itself into for a long term commitment. ","Shneur Gershuni ","Okay great. And as a follow up, just wanted to sort of chat about the CapEx in your backlog for a second here. You're taking down CO2 CapEx, I think Kim said in her prepared remarks that created an $80 million positive on free cash flow. Can we assume that that $80 million is the reduction in CapEx? And then I was wondering if you can comment on the project that you're evaluating with Tallgrass. The language in your press release was kind of a little interesting as this will evaluate [indiscernible] perceived indications. Trying to understand are you saying that it's likely moving forward? Or you're kind of -- sort of noodling it a little further?","Steve Kean","Okay, let's start with CO2. Yes, primarily the source of the additional free cash flow is associated with the dialing back of the capital expenditures. So that $80 million is primarily a result of that. On the Tallgrass project, so there are two things to think about here. One is that we have an existing pipeline system, the HH pipeline, and then that flows into it serves some other markets too, but it primarily flows into Tallgrass\u2019s Pony Express pipeline system.","We announced in open season, we and Tallgrass announced in open season, including the potential for an expansion there. But really certainly from our perspective, the right way to think about that on HH is we've signed up some customers on a firm basis. And in order to firm those commitments up and be able to provide firm service to those customers, we need to make it available to everybody. So we're doing an open season to make the capacity available to all customers but we're going through that process in order to firm up the commitments we've already made. ","The second piece is the potential to use our existing natural gas, underutilized natural gas assets in our western region and use them for crude takeaway out of the Bakken and DJ. And that's still something that we are exploring the opportunity for. But we don't really have any kind of definitive update for you on.","Operator","Our next question is from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Hey, I just wanted to follow up on the Tallgrass project. It seems like with Liberty and [Dapo] [ph] both going forward, it might be tough to get other people to sign up for another Bakken expansion to Cushing. A while ago, I think maybe at your Analysts Day last year, you'd mentioned looking into the possibility of converting HH to NGL service. Can you provide any color on why you ultimately decided not to go that way And is there any chance for it still? ","Steve Kean","Yes, so we didn't ultimately get the commitments that we would require there. And a competing project was announced in FID. And so it kind of soaked up that opportunity that demand.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, got it. And just as a quick follow-up. When Gulf Coast Express starts up, are you concerned about any near-term cannibalization of your existing gas pipelines out of the Permian or it\u2019s pretty much everything that you have already on take-or-pay?","Steve Kean","Well, we have a lot that\u2019s under take or pay, I think what we would expect is we've generated a lot of incremental opportunity out of our West gas pipelines this year associated with very short-term transaction parks and loans and things like that. And there will be some relief, which will reduce those opportunities for us for some period after GCX comes online. ","But I think it's a reduction, not an elimination and I think we're expecting for what it's worth, we're expecting that GCX is going to -- when you look at how much gas is being flared in the Permian, 700 a day or something, and the gas that's available to be brought online. We expect GCX to fill up very quickly. And we'll find a constraint out of the Permian burning. But it does have reduction of the opportunity that we're experiencing today on short-term transactions out of the West.","Operator","Our next question is from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Spiro Dounis","Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Just a follow up on GCX, looks like you're now investing about $250 million downstream there to facilitate a lot of the influx of gas that\u2019s coming. I guess just give us a little bit color in terms of what's the timing on that? And I asked because I -- we can see your concerns that once the gas serve initially hits Agua Dulce in September has nowhere to go, so just how you\u2019re thinking about problem solving for that?","Steve Kean","So it's about $250 million, we're going to get about 1.4 BCF out of additional take away there, which is a very capital efficient capacity expansion. And I think -- so that's -- we talk about that as our crossover two projects, we've already done one crossover projects. I think, we're evaluating other additional -- the need for other additional debottlenecking projects on our Texas Intrastate, as we continue to see the waves of gas coming in from the Permian.","And so that's the current investment and that's what we get for it. And it takes that gas and enables us to distribute it throughout the industrial areas downstream of [KD] [ph] really toward the coast. And there are probably more of those to come. In terms of the timing, time on the completion of crossover two, next year.","Spiro Dounis","Great, appreciate that. Just thinking about CapEx from a higher level. When you consider growth over the next two years. Is it right at this point in the market to get more aggressive here and try and capture more market share? Or does the commodity tape and slowdown in producer activity tell you to be maybe slightly more defensive here in the near-term? How you guys thinking about that generally speaking?","Steve Kean","I think we're thinking about it the way we always do, which is that, we look for our shippers to come forward when they need the capacity sign up for firm commitments to justify the capital on reasonable assumptions, including terminal value assumptions, et cetera. And I think we're just going to keep doing things that way conservatively. ","Rich Kinder","Again, we're living within our means so to speak. And so we anticipate our CapEx expenditures will stay in the range we've previously gone over with you namely in the $2 range.","Operator","Our next question is from Colton Bean with TPH. Your line is open.","Colton Bean","Good afternoon. Just to switch over to crude side of this. I just wanted to touch on the KMCC and Gray Oak JVs. Given the varying diameters there between the Halene [ph] lateral and then chunk lines Houston, do you have a plan for specifically where that interconnect would be?","Steve Kean","Yes, that\u2019s going to be really at the station [Technical Difficulty]. ","Colton Bean","Into the 30, okay. And so in terms of thinking about ultimate capacity there, I mean, is it right to think about if are tying a 30-inch [Technical Difficulty] pipe into the 30-inch KMCC that\u2019s ultimately you could match capacities.","Steve Kean","Possibly could, but right now the expansion project where we [Technical Difficulty] barrels a day. ","Colton Bean","Okay. And with the main consideration just the incremental horsepower?","Steve Kean","Yes, that\u2019s right. ","Colton Bean","Perfect. I guess just as a segue on that would there be any consideration here in terms of Double Eagle and maybe looping Double Eagle to give you ultimately if you went through with that 30-inch connection maybe you could get more barrels up from corpus as well and have a little bit of bidirectional header there.","Steve Kean","Double Eagle was a joint venture so we\u2019d have to kind of explore it with our joint venture partner. ","Colton Bean","Understood. I guess just a quick one, on the Haynesville I do think you guys have called out pretty strong volume growth there with the reduction in counterparty rig count there just to execute two, has that outlook shifted at all for the back half of 2019 or statuesque?","Steve Kean","We are still seeing very strong volumes there, we have had the benefit of being able to ramp up without substantial additional capital investment, we're probably going to have to invest some capital to debottleneck that system further to accommodate what we see as continued growth in that area. But still very, very attractive return projects, but our volumes remains strong. ","Operator","Our next question is from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Tristan Richardson","Hey, good afternoon. Just thinking would love to hear your views on strategic opportunities and priorities for capital looking forward, I think with GCX and PHP rolling off over the next 18 months, and combined with the dividend growth next year at your planned rate both of those combined to suggest that there is a real opportunity for free cash flow in the out years and again just thinking about priorities and what that could be used for?","Steve Kean","Yes, we will continue to -- obviously the first priority is maintain the balance sheet at the investment grade level. We\u2019ve gotten there, we\u2019ll make sure that we stay there. And we've laid out our dividend plan and we will adhere to that. And then in terms of the free cash flow that\u2019s available from there, we will put it towards the highest return use for our shareholders we think when we look ahead in our shadow backlog and other things that are on the horizon as Rich said, we think the $2 billion to $3 billion range is probably that\u2019s been the range for quite a while. We think that's a reasonable range of opportunities for us as we build off of our network, but to the extent that those opportunities are not there. We always have the option to buy back shares.","Tristan Richardson","Helpful, thank you guys very much. ","Operator","Our next question is from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. ","Keith Stanley","Hi, good afternoon, I just wanted to talk you got your FERC approval recently on the Gulf LNG export project just any update on commercial discussions there and potential timeline and viability of the project?","Steve Kean","Not really and I would say it so it\u2019s quite a ways off. You're right, we did -- we had applied for and we did receive our FERC approval on that asset that\u2019s a nice step, but there is nothing eminent there.","Keith Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open.","Christine Cho","Good evening. I wanted to actually maybe start on Permian Highway, with just all of the challenges with right-of-way permitting. Can we get an update on how that\u2019s tracking relative to budget?","Rich Kinder","We're still on schedule. So the piece of this pipeline is going through the hill country, which we knew was going to be a challenge. And so we allowed for extra time in the acquisition of right-of-way and we had a good victory and expected victory. But we had a good victory in the attempt to challenge the project and our use of imminent domain and our discussions with landowners in the area are continuing and I think continuing at a decent pace. So we expect that with the extra time that we allowed to get through this process that we will on schedule.","Christine Cho","What about on the cost side?","Rich Kinder","On the cost side, we still look very good, we expect to be on budget as well.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then with the Philadelphia refinery closing down, would just be curious as to your thoughts on how we should think about the impact for your products pipeline in your New York Harbor business, if any. ","Rich Kinder","Go ahead John.","John Schlosser","We think it will be positive in the long run, because we expect to see more imports coming in, in New York Harbor it will have a momentary short term impact. We do have 210,000 to be exact barrels with them in New York right now. But we expect to be able to release that they do supply are important three [Technical Difficulty], but we expect the additional volumes off the quality there. ","So maybe have an impact for the next month or so. Negative and in the long run, we think it'll be positive for us coming into New York.","Christine Cho","And then just last one for me, quick one, for the KMCC project what's the cost of that project? I'm guessing it's not that much because it's just pumps, but the term of the contracts? And should we think that the benefit will offset the re-contracting headwinds that you talked about in recent quarters? ","David Michels","Yes, so the initial cost of the project right now we're going to spend about $10 million this year. And so with that, we'll be able to get $100 million -- I'm sorry, 100,000 barrels a day in [Technical Difficulty] and get some initial agreements that really kick us off at 75,000.","Steve Kean","And for the term of up to three years on the term. And it'll be a partial offset but not a complete offset. The real objective here is we wanted to find a way to get Permian barrels into KMCC and that's what this interconnect accomplishes.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Dennis Coleman ","Hi, everyone. Thank you. I want to go back to the Permian Pass project if I can. You talked a little bit about this being mostly it sounds like a producer push project. But given where you talked about the target or the target area, you deliver a lot of gas already there for LNG. Wonder if there is sort of LNG pull demand. And if it relies on any particular projects above and beyond what's happened or been announced. ","Steve Kean","I mean, clearly it's serving the LNG projects are going forward on the side of Texas, East Gulf Coast of Texas. Golden pass where we won potential customer, Port Arthur LNG and other that is not FID just pretty promising. But there's also connectivity back into our intrastate network proportion of this volume so we would expect that volume to go and serve industrial customers on the side of our system. Then we will be crossing several interstate pipelines farther east. And so that will also be an alternative market.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. And then maybe just if you can give a couple quick comments on how you think about returns versus the two projects that you've already have under development. Just it's becoming harder and harder to build these pipelines. I think we can we can all agree on that. We just talked about some of the issues with Permian Highway. Is there as a time where you as a pipeline developer are able to capture higher return from producers or demand it because of the greater sort of project risk that you face.","Steve Kean","The returns are in line with what we've been experiencing on the previous projects, and they're good returns, we've got competition so we don't talk about them in specifics, but they're good double digit levered after tax returns with long-term contracts securing or underpinning those cash flows.","In terms of -- and those are pretty good returns, I mean and we're glad to be able to get them and we try to manage our project risk to the other part of your question by making sure that we adequately account for what we are seeing in the environment in which we are building these projects. And so that factors into how we schedule the permitting process and the right-of-way acquisitions process, it goes into how we select the route, goes into all of those things. So we think we manage the risk by costing it right, scheduling it right and the returns that we're getting compensate us for the risk. ","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys. Just a question on the gas pipeline business. Where do you stand or what remains left in terms of the 501-G process for you and does that $100 million number you put out at the Analysts Day still hold? And then how are you thinking about traditional weak and tracking risk for the projects that have negotiated rates, kind of back half of this year and going into 2020?","Steve Kean","Okay. So what we talked about on the 501-G which is an exposure that we believe we have behind us are largely behind this. We have two remaining pipes with the smaller amounts at issue that we're waiting on final decisions on. But with the ones that we've done, it was $50 million for this year, growing to $100 million next year for the full year effect of both of those settlements.","And so as we said, we didn't budget they're very hard to predict, we didn't budget for them, but we were happy to get them because we believe they resolved a longer term risk and a headwind to the company. So it's $50 million this year and $100 million next year.","In terms of your contract roll off question, I think where that risk is really concentrated is in our FEP, Fayetteville Express Pipeline and the Ruby Pipeline, and the time frame there is 2021, 2022.","Michael Lapides","Got it? And then a question -- I noticed the contract with Con Edison had a little bit of capacity via compression in the Northeast. Obviously, it's borderline impossible to get new pipelines built into the Northeast. How much incremental opportunity do you see to do similar type of projects to help add incremental capacity into the region?","Steve Kean","Okay, I think this is the second one. So we've got one our line 261 project in Massachusetts that's the first one and then this one. And what we're trying to do is find those opportunities where we can\u2019t get pipelines permitted. And we think these are very formidable pipelines. Where we can get them permitted to build debottlenecking expansions to help our customers, for example, Lift moratoria that they have in place on signing up new customers. ","These are very valuable projects, are very much in the public interest. And we think that the way we've been very careful and thoughtful about how we're putting them together, because of the permitting risk in the Northeast. So we'll continue to look for those we've already had two.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thanks, Steve. Much appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Your line is open. ","Becca Followill","Thank you. Good afternoon. How much of the $800 million delta in the backlog is due to taking out the CO2 projects?","Steve Kean"," Yes, $500 million.","Becca Followill","And then second on the FERC NOI and ROE. You guys put up some comments here, which were very thoughtful. Any thoughts on timing of the process with the FERC?","Steve Kean","Nothing sort of proprietary. They've gone through a similar kind of macro evaluation like this on the certificates policy. And I think we're still waiting to see if there's anything final that's going to come out of that. And on this, it's a little hard to project exactly. I think from the comments that we and others filed, I think hope it's apparent to the commission. There are a lot of differences in circumstances, there's not really a one size fits all. I think that they would probably, I'm guessing that that's what they would come away from looking at the record that's in front of us.","And I would hope also, that they would find there's a pretty clear distinction between the electric side and the natural gas side in terms of the competitive environment that we operate in, in the natural gas sector. So we made those points other people made those points, too. I think it's hard to craft from the circumstances that have been laid out, a one size fits all policy. So we wouldn\u2019t expect one.","Becca Followill","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Robert Kwan ","Good afternoon. Just looking at the KML share buyback. First mechanically, is there going to be a prorata buyback of the KMI share? ","Steve Kean","No this is the buyback program that applies to the public flow.","Robert Kwan ","Okay. And then you cited it as an attractive opportunity. I'm just wondering, what types of things and metrics are you looking at? Is it kind of DCF accretion on an absolute basis or do you also look at the MCIB [ph] versus potential new projects, acquisitions or other growth initiatives? ","Steve Kean","Yeah, I mean, we will certainly be evaluating what other opportunities there are to -- for that capital. We do look at DCF accretion as being kind of the primary thing that we focus our attention on. But we don't have anything formulaic here, Robert, we're going to be very opportunistic about the use of the program. But we thought that it was good to put in place certainly the board agreed and it was thing to have in place for our KML shareholders. And we will did it the right. But we use the right time, economically for our shareholders. ","Robert Kwan ","Got it. And I guess just that kind of selectively an opportunistic language. I assume that the Board also examines something larger, like a substantial issuer bid but decided technically the MCIB is kind of the right thing at this point.","Steve Kean","I think that's a fair conclusion.","Robert Kwan ","Okay, that's great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Catellier with CIBC Capital Markets, your line is open. ","Robert Catellier","Thank you. Just answered my question, I was curious about the evaluation of a substantial issuer bid. Thank you. ","Steve Kean","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is from Spiro Dounis with Capital Suisse Your line is open. ","Spiro Dounis","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me back in just had one follow up. So the answer this might be a bit obvious, but just given the rapid pace of buying this year, still kind of compelled to ask Rich, can you just comment a little bit on the uptick that you\u2019re buying so far this year, the stock? Maybe what changed since last year, and how you're thinking about valuation at this point, just given the nice run up year to date?","Rich Kinder","I don't really have much to say on that. Obviously, I'm a huge believer in the upside opportunities for this company, and the kind of dividend policy we have makes it even more attractive. So I am interested shareholder and will continue to be.","Spiro Dounis ","Fair enough. Pretty good color.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Jeremy Tonet","Hi, thanks for squeezing in as well, Just want to come back to Elba, I think you had touched on it briefly there. But I was wondering if you could dive in a little bit more, as far as what was causing the issues with the cryogenic temperatures there? What do you learn to get that solved? Is there going to be any issues with subsequent trains and I guess what gives you confidence that everything is good at this point?","Steve Kean","Yes, so as I mentioned, the issue that we had was making sure that we had a uniformly cold box where we make the LNG, and we had some mechanical issues associated with having LNG at actually too low of a temperature and solidifying it. And so we needed to get the top of the box cool uniformly with the bottom and what that required was a slower startup. So I would say essentially, we were trying to start it too fast.","And so as we gradually stepped into it, and we're making very, very good progress. Now, with the uniformly cold box, it's about turning it up, and we\u2019re turning it up as we speak. And then we have an eight day performance test and then in service. I think as we've gone through this, we've observed where we had issues like with the valve or a seal, and those sorts of things. And so we're working ahead on the other units to make sure that those are all addressed.","And so, we've got kind of one final operational issue that we're dealing with, and it seems to be our approach to so it\u2019s working fine. And so if that's the case will be up very soon. If we have to slow down for a bit to fix a problem, it could cause a little bit further delay. But the way we\u2019ve narrowed down the problems now we're confident in its startups, that that startup will be soon, and that it will be operable once up and running. And that the lessons from the startup on the first unit which is the critical unit as we\u2019ve said, commercially for the contract, that the lessons that we've learned from the startup with the first unit are being applied to the remaining unit.","As I said, for including the first one for mechanically complete, all of the units are on the Elba Island and we're going through the assembly, and then the commission process as well over the course of this year, with maybe a slight -- maybe one of them drifting into that.","Jeremy Tonet","That's very helpful. Thanks. And with the EOR [ph] just wanted to come to that real quick is there more that that could be reduced that pricing and economic just as far as the CapEx spend there? Or is there a certain level of kind of base spend where you don't want to fall below because that could lead to kind of a decline curves picking up or anything like that where you not able to maintain production at the levels you want?","Steve Kean","As always, we look at every one of these projects on a return basis. So we invest this, we can identify the incremental oil that's associated with investing this and at reasonable range of prices that will produce an economic return at our hurdle rate that\u2019s higher than our other remaining businesses. That's how we do it. And so there's not a base level of capital that we feel we have to spend for some operational or other reasons.","We do it each project on a project-by-project basis and on a return basis. And I think the team there, the CO2 team has done a really fine job of knowing when capital is not going to be effectively deployed, and finding other places to deploy it that provide attractive returns or if we can't find that, then we don't spend it. And that's the way we're going to proceed. We have a lot of discipline, I believe around here on the capital that we deploy and the confidence that we have to have in the returns being adequate to our investors. And I think the CO2 group demonstrates that.","Operator","At this time I'm showing no further questions.","Rich Kinder","All right. Well, thank you all very much. Have a good evening. ","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. All lines may disconnect at this time."]}}
