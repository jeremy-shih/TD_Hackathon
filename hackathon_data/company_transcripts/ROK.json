I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks, Deanna. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. Additionally, a webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","With me today as always are Keith Nosbusch; our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year, as well as some full year outlook commentary. Then Ted will provide more details around the second quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2012, and we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. ","We know it's been a busy earnings week for all of you, so we appreciate you dialing in today. We expect the call to take about an hour, maybe a little bit less. ","As is always the case on these calls, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand over the call to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover some highlights for the quarter and a summary of our performance in the first half of the year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. We had solid 8% growth excluding currency in Q2 and 7% organic growth. ","I was really pleased to see solid organic growth in every region. North American market conditions have remained healthy. Our reported sales growth in the U.S. was 5% this quarter. But because of an unusually large project that shipped in quarter 2 last year, we believe that understates the strength of market conditions in the U.S. If we carved that large project out, growth in the U.S. would have been several points higher. Canada was a standout with 25% growth. We are successfully capitalizing on the strength of resource-based industries there. ","Europe had another strong quarter despite macroeconomic headwinds. Our team there is executing very well in a difficult environment. ","I was encouraged to see Asia return to double-digit growth in the quarter. China improved to high single-digit growth, and we are optimistic that market conditions will continue to improve in the second half of the year. Our outlook for India is more cautious. Sales in India were flat in the quarter, and we have yet to see evidence of improvement in the economy. ","Lastly, while Latin America organic sales were only up 4% in the quarter, they have difficult comparison to a great quarter last year. Orders were strong in the quarter, and we continue to expect double-digit growth for the full year. I hope that regional color was helpful. I have a few other second quarter highlights to share before I move on to the first half. ","Our Process business continued to gain traction and delivered another quarter of over 20% sales growth. We continue to expand our integrator network, which is enabling us to pursue a broader spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity, and we are executing well. We introduced 2 new Logix mid-range controller platforms that improved scalability and Ethernet connectivity, plus enhanced motion for our OEM customers. ","For the fourth time, we were recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. This award is a real tribute to the efforts of all of our employees and the importance of ethics in our culture. ","Ted will provide more detail on second quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'd like to provide a few highlights on the first half of the fiscal year. ","I am pleased with our year-over-year performance through the end of March. Sales grew over 8%, excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 1.7 points, and segment conversion margin was over 40%. Earnings per share in the first half grew 12% in spite of a pretty significant headwind from taxes, and we continue to generate best-in-class return on invested capital. ","So far, the year has played out a little differently than we thought it would. Developed markets have been a bit stronger and emerging markets weaker than we originally expected. But overall, at the halfway point of the year, we're pretty much where we expected to be, and we're well positioned as we enter the second half. ","So this is how we're thinking about the second half. We expect sequential sales growth in all regions and across our Product & Solutions and services businesses. We had a good first half in developed markets, and we expect those markets to remain solid for the rest of the year. ","In emerging markets, we expect stronger growth in the second half of the year. Our outlook for China and Latin America is strong. We expect to return to double-digit growth in the second half. But we are more cautious on India, as we have yet to see signs of economic improvement there.","Despite some mixed signals in the macro environment, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our pipeline of opportunities, and we continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. ","With 2 quarters behind us and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we are maintaining the midpoint of both our sales and earnings per share guidance for the year and narrowing the ranges. The narrowed range for earnings per share guidance is $5.10 to $5.40. Sales and earnings within our guidance ranges would represent another record year for the company. Ted will provide more color on the assumptions in our guidance in his remarks. ","Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. We are executing our growth and performance strategy well, and that will enable us to deliver superior returns to our share owners. ","With that, I'll now hand it over to Ted.","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning to everybody out there. I'll be referencing the slides on the website, and I'll start with Slide #5, which is titled Second Quarter Results: Summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,561,000,000, up 7% compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 1 point, and the contribution from acquisitions increased sales by about 1 point. ","Segment operating earnings were $268 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago. General corporate net was $25.1 million compared to $20.5 million in Q2 last year. The increase was due to a $7 million legacy environmental charge related to former Rockwell International sites. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.9%. ","Diluted earnings per share was $1.16, up a bit from last year. While we had a reasonable increase in segment operating earnings, the combination of our legacy environmental charge and a higher tax rate reduced EPS by about $0.13. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 144.7 million, and during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 508,000 shares at a cost of about $41 million. ","Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the second quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q2 was 7%. Sales increased by 6% sequentially. ","On the right side of the slide, segment operating earnings were $268 million, up 10% compared to Q2 last year, with segment operating margin at 17.2%, up by 0.5 point from last year. The year-over-year margin expansion is due primarily to volume leverage and a favorable contribution from price, partly offset by increased spending. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in both segments. Sequentially, operating earnings declined by about 5%, and segment operating margin was 2 points lower. ","Last quarter, we talked about Q1 being an unusually strong margin quarter, and we said that we expected lower operating margins in the balance of the year. All the factors we said would cause margins to be lower in the balance of the year came into play in the second quarter, and that was less favorable mix, the normal January wage and salary increases, other increased spending and less favorable impact from currency. ","As Keith pointed out, we're pleased with the first half performance, including margins. Segment operating margin for the first half was 18.2%, up 1.7 points compared to the first half of last year and with a related conversion margin of 42%. Although it's not shown on the slide, our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 30.5%. ","I'll turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q2 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales increased 7% year-over-year, reaching $665 million. Currency translation reduced sales by about 1 point. Sales increased 2% sequentially in the segment. ","Operating margin for the quarter was 25.2%, up 0.8 point from Q2 last year. And year-to-date, operating margin in Architecture & Software is 26.9%, up 2.2 points from last year.","On Slide 8, you'll see the results for our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 7% compared to Q2 last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 1-point reduction due to currency and with particularly strong growth in the Solutions and services businesses. Sales increased 9% sequentially in Control Products & Solutions. ","Segment operating earnings were $101 million, with segment operating margin up 0.2 point from the same quarter last year. Year-to-date Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.4 points compared to last year. ","Switching to the next slide. This is a look at regional sales performance. You can see here the growth rates by region, both as reported and excluding currency effects. Keith covered most of the regional highlights in his comments. So perhaps, I'll provide just a bit more color for EMEA. ","EMEA continued to deliver very good results with 12% currency-neutral growth. You can see that in the far right column. EMEA was the only region with a significant impact from acquisitions in the quarter. But excluding the effect of acquisitions, EMEA still had a very healthy 7% increase year-over-year. ","I'll turn now to Slide #10, the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million. That's about 137% conversion on net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, and that includes the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter. We would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. ","And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. This slide provides a comparison of first half results to the full year guidance. Looking at the first half results, as I mentioned, we're pleased with the growth in sales, the margin performance and the EPS performance, and we're pretty much where we expected to be at the midyear point. ","As Keith mentioned, with 2 quarters behind us, we have narrowed the guidance. We now expect sales for the full year in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. That compares to the previous guidance of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. We expect currency translation to reduce sales by 2 points for the full year. Our previous guidance assumed a 1-point decrease due to currency. ","Last quarter, you may remember, we identified currency as a risk to the full year sales guidance. With another quarter of experience behind us, we're now building that into the guidance. Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of between 6% and 9%. Previous guidance was 5% to 9%. ","The $50 million drop at the top end of the sales range primarily reflects the increased negative impact due to currency. At the bottom end of the sales range, we're absorbing the negative currency impact but increasing our expectation for full year organic growth by about 1 point. ","We still expect segment margin to be around 18%, probably a little better. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.10 to $5.40. The $0.05 reduction at the high end of the EPS range includes the more negative impact of currency. We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. ","And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year. That's up from the previous guidance of $86 million, and the increase reflects the legacy environmental charges that were incurred in Q2. ","And with that, I'll turn this back over to Rondi.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] So Deanna, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ted, on incrementals. Just when you look at on year-over-year basis, a little bit below our expectations. And I just was thinking of it in terms of commodity headwind, that was pretty significant last year at this time, and you put through price as the year went on. What was the spread on price cost in the quarter? And did that have any positive benefit on margin year-over-year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think on commodity costs, we are running a little bit higher than a year ago but not outside our expectations and, I'd say, consistent with our original guidance. On price, we said we thought we would realize about 1 point, maybe a little bit less. And I would say, through the first half, we're very much on track with that. So I think price cost through the first half and in the second quarter was pretty much as we expected.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the mix with Solutions. I think you had raised that last quarter to 2 to 3 points incremental versus 1 point in the original guidance. Where are you now within the guidance for Solutions mix?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I think what we have seen through the first half and with what we've got in backlog now, it looks like Solutions growth is even going to be a little bit better than we originally thought, and Product growth just may be slightly lower than we originally thought. So that 3-point difference has now become a several-point difference.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So interested in the pickup again in Asia-Pac and in China. Can you talk a little bit about how you saw that progress through the quarter and exiting the quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Absolutely. We -- with respect to the trend in the quarter, it definitely got stronger. I think there's probably 2 reasons for that. One is, as we talked last time, there was the impact of liquidity, particularly on small and midsized customers, and China has been easing their reserve ratio in the period. But then second is just the holiday in Asia, with the Chinese New Year occurring generally a little -- in the early part of the quarter, that as we exited, we saw a stronger momentum building as we went through March. And March was very solid, which, I think, drove a lot of the performance that we talked about, improvement on a sequential basis from Q1. But I would say those 2 things with growing momentum as we exited the quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just maybe, Ted, on the incremental. So I understand that the components in 2Q, obviously, I think hit a little bit more than we thought. We all knew they were coming down from 57, came down a little more. As you think about the back half, I mean, to work towards the higher end, it looks like they have to get a little better again. So can you maybe talk about the dynamics heading into 3Q, 4Q from an incremental standpoint?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I mean, I think if you look at the implied incrementals for the full year now, we're kind of in the mid to high 30s. And given where we had been in the first half, that would put the second half in that same -- the high-30s range. So we're pretty comfortable with that given our expectations for volume growth in the second half, but we are going to have some headwind from mix in the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I mean -- I guess relative to this quarter, what would be the key things that are not as much pressure on the 3Q, 4Q incrementals?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think, there's going to be a contribution from volume compared to this quarter, a little bit of headwind from mix, and then there's just some other noise kind of stuff that affects quarter-to-quarter results. And when you do the conversion, you've also got the complication of what was going on in the quarter the prior year before.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So basically, no change to kind of thinking 35-plus or something on incrementals?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think that's right.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Winnie Clark, UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First of all, just quickly on end market color. Could you give us an update on what you're seeing by end market? I know transportation has been a bright spot. Does that continue to be the case? And you talked about some acceleration expected in Process end markets as well.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Let me comment on a couple of the end markets. You hit the first one, which was auto. And certainly, we felt auto was strong in the quarter, and we continue to believe that, that will help us as we go through the year. Associated with that would be tire. Tire has been a very strong market over the last, probably, 12 to 18 months now. While we're not seeing the growth there, tire is continuing to stay at the high level with just a little bit of shift of where and who's doing the investing, but the market itself continues to perform well. Oil and gas is strong pretty much across the board, and that is pretty much a continuation. Water wastewater, strong in the U.S. Mining, strong in Latin America, Canada and the South Africa, Middle East region for us, with respect to EMEA. The consumer products, consumer is a little bit mixed. When you look at it in total, the food and beverage market, a lot of the investment there is primarily in emerging markets as we go forward. Life sciences becoming a little stronger in EMEA. And then the one that's probably a little weaker within consumer is the home and personal care market at this point in time. So that gives you a little feel for the different end markets.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just within EMEA. Can you talk about, within the different areas, what you're seeing there specifically? And you talked about the export market is strong last quarter. Is that something you're still seeing?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, yes. Within EMEA, we see a continuation of what you just mentioned we talked about in Q1, and that is the strength of the exporting sector. I think the strength of the exporting sector is starting to diverge a little. And that is continued strong exports back into the U.S. but a little weakening of exports into Asia because of some of the slowdowns that were taking place there, so a little difference as we see that happening at the moment. Then we also have the phenomenon between north and south, I'll call it, Western Europe, if you will. The continuing debt crisis in the south impacting a little bit stronger into Spain and Italy now, and the north being more of the exporting region goes back to my earlier comments. And then the last point I'd make with respect to Europe would be that emerging aspects, which, for us, would be areas like Russia and Turkey, they continue to perform well in the second quarter, equally strong -- almost equally as strong as they were in our first quarter. So we see continued growth there, and then the Western Europe would be back to the earlier comments I made.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Terry Darling, Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit or clarify -- it sounds like you're looking on organic for a little bit of an acceleration in the second half versus where we've been here. And I'm taking it -- from that, Ted, your comments in response to Shannon's question, but also this idea that the U.S. was impacted by comps here in the March quarter. But -- I mean, if you could just flesh that out a little bit more.","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I would say, on an x currency basis, on a year-over-year basis, the current guidance would call for growth about equal in the second half to the first half. And there's probably not enough acquisition impact in either half to affect that much, so think of that as organic.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so what -- just the offset then in the context of a flatter -- so U.S. you're saying tough comp in the first quarter but something else decelerates in that mix. In other words, you\u2019ve talked about EM getting better in the second half. That's pretty clear. So to offset that, you'd have to have a slowing in DM, and maybe that\u2019s Europe, but...","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think that's exactly the case, Terry.  I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question from a regional point of view. I mean, we do expect strong growth rates in the emerging market in the second half, and we do expect lower growth rates in the mature markets. But that's kind of what we've been talking about for a while in terms of a continuing deceleration in the mature markets as the -- just as the cycle continues to play out.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on your point with regards to margins and certain things happening in given quarters, I mean, just on CPS margins, that's really where the weakness was on our look of things. I guess it was our thought that you had very easy comps because of all the impact from material pressures and Japan supply chain issues last year. So is it really just mix going on here? Or are you seeing some pricing pressure there? I know you talked about 1 point, and that's in line. But you raised some prices in, I think, August or September that was likely to drive a better year-over-year comp, at least in the first half of the year. What else is going on at CP&S, given how easy that comp was that you didn't have a little bit stronger incremental than 15% year-over-year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I would say we got a reasonable contribution from the volume. We've got the favorable contribution for price we were expecting. And actually, I talked about being a little under 1 point. It wasn't a lot -- it wasn't much different in either of the segments. There's a negative mix impact in CP&S year-over-year, and that's basically higher Solutions growth. And we've got the spending impact that we have talked about in both segments year-over-year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And did you call that mix effect a 3-point impact? That's a revenue impact, presumably. But can you clarify how much that mix impact was?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, it would have been less than 0.5 point of margin year-over-year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, continue to sit on very strong balance sheet. Buyback has been slower in the first half of the year than the pace from last year. Are you looking to step up buyback in the second half of the fiscal year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I would say yes. I mean, obviously, our repurchases in any period are going to depend on the cash generation and what's going on with acquisition spending. But if you look at our expectations for cash flow generation this year and you back out some reasonable estimate of acquisition spending, we would expect to probably repurchase about 3 million shares this year. Obviously, we have not been at that pace in the first half. Partly in the first quarter, we stepped back a little bit because of the large pension contribution. I would say in Q2, we got a little bit of a slow start in January under a 10b5-1 plan. But our repurchases did accelerate through February and March, and we would expect to kind of be on pace through the rest of the year to get to that roughly $3 million number -- 3 million share number, I'm sorry.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is that 3 million, Ted, is that net or gross of issuance-related options and so forth?","Theodore D. Crandall","That's gross.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. My first question, I guess, on the -- just the margin outlook. If you're looking at your gross -- let's start with, I guess, CP&S or incremental margins or your operating margins. The operating margins there have been, I guess, around 11% last year, tracking at about 11.5% this year. Last cycle, they -- operating margins, they got up to towards mid-teens. I guess is there anything this cycle versus previous that you think will cap the operating margins in that business for the next sort of couple of years that would stop you getting back to that prior peak growth rate before, let's say, 2014?","Theodore D. Crandall","I don't think I would characterize it as something that's going to cap the margins. But we do have some headwind this cycle, particularly in CP&S, compared to last cycle. Part of that is an increasing Solutions content as a percent of the total, so we've got that mix headwind we have talked about previously. And the other thing I think we\u2019ve talked about previously is we've got substantially higher pension expense this cycle than we had last cycle. And because CP&S tends to be our more people-intensive business, it has somewhat of a disproportionate impact in that segment.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just on your sort of developed market growth assumptions for the second half year-on-year. I think you've said a couple of times that, that would -- that growth rate would decelerate year-on-year in the second half compared to what you delivered in the first half. But it sounds like the U.S. may be a little bit better because of easier comps. So what sort of growth rate are you expecting for EMEA in the second half? Is that a very big step down year-on-year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I mean, I would say we're thinking that -- and it'll vary across our sales guidance range, obviously. But at the midpoint of the range, we're thinking the second half on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding acquisition impact, might be maybe 3 points lower than the first half.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Want to get a sense -- your Process business continues to be strong. And a couple of questions here. I mean, first, how much of that is -- when you think of it being up 20%, I mean, how much of that is business you're going in with partnership and with Endress+Hauser? I mean, kind of how big of a help is that? And then I have a follow-on on that as well.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, certainly, it's hard for me to say exactly how much of a help that is. But it certainly is part of the broader strategy of a -- of our Process strategy, which is we can supply a complete integrated solution, including instrumentation, when that's the way the customer wants to purchase it and to do that from an ability to provide the integration services, the maintenance services, the asset management associated with that equipment and to provide a more seamless startup for our customers. So it's part of the Process strategy. In some customers, E&H has a strong position. In some customers, Rockwell has a stronger position, and we help each other. And then we target other customers where we just want to break into that market. So it's -- I just view it as it's a good partnership, and we help each other in growing our mutual business at our common customers.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, understand. One of the things I think we're trying to figure out, if you -- byproduct of low natural gas prices, of course, we\u2019ve got a bunch of ethylene crackers that are coming into the U.S. and other pretty large chemical projects as well. Are you guys kind of ready to step into some of these big projects or have credibility in the market to step into some of these projects and take a much larger role, as like a master automation contract or that type of thing? Or how do you kind of see that playing out?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think as far as being able to be a Main Automation Contractor, or a MAC, as you referred, we do that in a number of industries and a number of applications. And we've done that now for, certainly, over the last year or 2, particularly more outside the U.S. because, obviously, as you well know, that's where most of the greenfield and expansion had been going, particularly in the oil and gas industries. Your comments about, and specifically, to the U.S. and the expansion into large-scale chemical complexes, I would say that is one of the places that is not Rockwell Automation's sweet spot. That is very similar to what we talk about in the oil and gas segment, being refining, the bulk chemical projects. The majority of our applications there and where we do have and where we are capable and will participate is in the intelligent motor control aspects of that business, with our medium-voltage drives and motor control centers and our safety systems from a process standpoint. And there, we will become a significant participant and to work with the companies that are starting that up, that are talking about those new facilities. But when you look at the main process control, that is an area that while we have capabilities, that would not be our historical strength and, certainly, is an area that we will participate in. In the areas that I talked about, as well as our advanced process control, which is an area that we have worked with all of these companies globally on, in particular outside the U.S., and advanced process control is a capability that we do have where we're talking about reduction of process variability and improving the control of the -- of those core chemical processes with some very sophisticated modeling technologies and capabilities. So different pieces, absolutely. And we're aware of those expansions that you've referenced.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first question on Logix and integrated architecture and the penetration rates that you're achieving. If you think about just sizing that now, I know it's not just a quarterly issue, but can you give us a little more color and flavor for that penetration and the size of the business in terms of how you see that -- playing out to the rest of the year so that we're not -- I\u2019m not just focused only on the cycle but trying to think about your penetration share gains?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Well, certainly, let's take the near-end look, and that's for the remainder of the year. We would expect Logix to grow at a growth rate above the company average, and that's certainly what we're planning on. With respect to penetration, that's a larger -- well, let me just -- and we expect to see really solid high single, low double-digit growth rate for the year in Logix. As far as the penetration, we continue to expand the opportunities for Logix. So we have not -- and when I say that, I mean, we're expanding the served market for Logix, and that's what I talked about the new 2 controllers that came out. That's expanding the market that we have had -- that we cover going into OEMs, going in the process, the addition of safety, the addition of broader Ethernet capabilities, all of this is expanding the scalability and, therefore, the served market for Logix. So our penetration -- in one way, you can say it keeps going down because we keep expanding the market. So we believe we still have runway to grow Logix as we go forward, and certainly, that's one of the reasons we continue to invest in it, to be able to continue to expand the served market and, therefore, be able to continue to drive that higher growth that I talked about. And this year, for the first time, we expect Logix sales to be over $1 billion. So -- and we see no reason we can't continue to grow that above the company average into the -- certainly, the short and midterm future.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And would you say -- how big a deal is the integrator network overall in terms of -- as a growth limiter to your ability to drive this? And how much investment -- or how does that relate to your investment, particularly overseas, in building that out?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Well, the fact of the matter is it's not our investment to build it out, other than the people that we have on staffs to grow the relationships, because these are independent third-party companies that create the integrator network. So ours is creating the relationships and building the interfaces and the day-to-day interaction with our sales and\/or channel management teams. And certainly, we don't see it as a limitation from the standpoint of we continually grow and develop it. And we talk about it, particular in Process, one of the reasons we are growing at the rate we are is that we continue to expand the integrator network, and to your point, very much so in the emerging markets. And I think the challenge is more of finding competent, talented integrators in some of the emerging markets that can support the technology and have the domain expertise to grow into some of these new markets. So I think it's more the availability issue and having the competence to continue to expand. But we are constantly evolving and growing that partner network throughout the world.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, you haven't changed your approach in terms of either funding -- finding promising folks who aren't system integrators yet and putting them in the business so that they can help drive your growth. I'm just trying to get a sense on the emerging market side of how big a limiter or not this is.","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, I don't -- we don't see it as a limiter, and we operate in 2 dimensions here. One is, if you notice some of the acquisitions we've made have been system integrators in the emerging markets so that we can get a critical mass with domain expertise. But at the same time, we're expanding the partner network so that we can work with more customers. Because at the end of the day, it's the customer that decides how they want to work here. Do they want to work with a local integrator? Or do they want to work with a Rockwell Automation who can probably provide more commonality, more standardization globally than a local system integrator could. So we try to look at that as the best of both worlds and how do we balance the growth of local integrators versus continuing to expand our solutions capability and domain expertise in the emerging markets.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So, Keith, you talked about the divergence between CPS and A&S growth rates to several points. And I'm just wondering, is this a temporary divergence? Or are we now at the phase of the cycle where large projects are going to be the primary driver of your top line growth?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, we don't -- back to where we are in the cycle, we think we're still in a -- in the part of the cycle where we should see growth in both our Product businesses and our Solutions businesses. I think the gap that we talked about is mainly because of the -- excuse me, the slow start we had, particularly in Asia in emerging markets in our first quarter and the hole we dug with the expanded shipments we had in our fourth quarter last year. And as we rebuild that pipeline with orders, we're just seeing that order flow now come through in the second half of the year. So we're seeing some moderating in Product, but a normal expansion in our Solutions business. And we don't see that as an indication at this point yet of a movement towards end-of-cycle large projects in heavy industries. But the other part of that is, we're naturally growing our Process business. So we are seeing some of that as just the -- as far as just the natural evolution of our strategy as we go forward. So we would expect more larger projects, more in the heavy industries, particularly in the emerging markets, and some of that is just the natural evolution following our growth and performance strategy. And yet, for the remainder of the year, we still expect above-market growth in both Products and Solutions.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then coming back to the U.S. \"manufacturing renaissance.\" It's not just the chemical and crackers. We're also seeing some tire manufacturing relocations. We're seeing some heavy manufacturing expansions. Are you starting to see that in your numbers right now? Are you starting to see that in your order flow? Or is that to come in 2013 and beyond?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, we -- I would say we're not seeing that in our business at this point in time. We're starting to have the anecdotal commentary as we do our normal quarterly pulse check. I would say the U.S. organization would tell us that they're having conversations, that people are bringing it up. But we're not seeing a mass change of direction here going forward. But certainly, the topic and the interest in manufacturing in the U.S. has picked up. And I think that's good, not just for Rockwell Automation but also just for the economy in general. So conversation at this point, we would expect to -- if there is going to be an impact, that's a little longer term as far as an investment cycle that it would bring with it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more quick one, if I may. You mentioned the prior second quarter 2011, you had a particularly large project, which I'm assuming is within CPS. Would you describe that as a particularly profitable project? Because it looked like your margins in the prior quarter were somewhat higher than they might otherwise have been.","Keith D. Nosbusch","No. I would not qualify that one as a -- I think it's what we would call it to be the average of our Solutions business for us, not one that was particularly strong. So I don't think that's had any impact into year-over-year performance.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of things, if I could. Just first back to China. Keith, if you said it, I missed it. Could you just tell us what China actually did in the quarter on a standalone basis? And then more importantly, I was just interested in your view on what you're seeing change to kind of bolster your outlook in the second half of the year? What end markets, what type of activity is driving that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Well, first of all, I did not mention it, but China grew at 7% for us this year -- this quarter. I'm sorry, this quarter, excuse me. And that was up from negative growth last quarter. What are we seeing that's different? Well, I think a couple of things. First, our team there is doing a very good job at uncovering new customers and new applications. And that does take a little bit of time, and that's why sometimes you get a dwell period, particularly when the economy is slowing. And we have seen that in China, and I think all of the statistics point to that, which is something that you've seen. As where are we seeing this now? I think we're starting to see some of the liquidity problems working their way through the system. We would hope that, that is going to be a continuing theme as we go through the year, which is why we believe the uptake will come up. And we see a split, really, between large customers and smaller customers yet. The larger companies are getting stronger and investing more. And we still see some of the pain at those smaller customers at this point, and that's really driven because of the liquidity problems that I talked about. The other reason we think we're going to see a better second half is our front-log activity has picked up, and that really goes back to the earlier comment I made about our sales organization is working very aggressively. We believe OEMs continue to be strong for us. To be able to create new OEMs, it takes time to work with them in the design phase and the design cycle. So we're expecting a pickup with OEMs as we go forward. And just the ongoing maturity of our distributors and our system integrators will help and should always help provide some tailwind as well. But that's a -- that's also a long-term process for us as well. So I think those would be the thoughts that we have with respect to China, both current, and why we feel we will expect to see an acceleration in the second half.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just one additional point on that. Clearly, a lot of what you said is about making your own luck. I guess the liquidity stuff is more a macro comment. How much of this do you think is you driving the business versus some genuine improvement in the underlying business and market conditions there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think if you look at the underlying market conditions, they continue to be mixed. If you look at the PMI, depending upon which one you look at, the third-party one, which tends to be most of the multinationals, is still under 50% and has been under 50% for, I think, maybe 6 or more months now. So that tells you that manufacturing is slowing. If you look at the data that they communicate, they just recently lowered their growth rates another 0.5 point. And so their exports have been impacted to some degree. So I would say the majority of our success has been us working it as opposed to the continued growth or -- at a high level of -- while the growth rates are still strong, they're declining from where they were. So it isn't like the overall business is pulling us along with it. I think we're having to work harder, and we're having to create more of our opportunities and grow more customers. And that's why I'm complimenting our team in China because it's -- while it might have been stronger market growth previously, we have certainly strong growth, but our performance, I think, indicates that the team is outperforming the underlying market there as well.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes, that's impressive. Just one other quick thing for me, and I'll jump off. Is there any color or anything you could share on just the state of distribution in the U.S.? Are distributors destocking, restocking? Just kind of where their head is around just kind of a general tone of activity in the U.S. market.","Theodore D. Crandall","Jeff, this is Ted. I think you know we've got pretty good visibility of North American distributor inventories. And I would say, nothing unusual going on in their inventories. They have increased proportionate to kind of what they're seeing as end demand increase. And if you look kind of at the underlying product sales in Q2 in North America, it was another very good quarter for our distributors.","Operator","And the final question will come from the line of Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Keith, could you just speak for a second to maybe the mix within the A&S business? Can you -- looking at the core growth rate of about 8%, was the Process & Software piece up more? Is that where the mix impact came versus the peripheral Products business?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think around -- Logix was slightly higher than the average. And I would say, last time, we talked a little bit -- last year at this time, we talked about motion being much stronger, and that was the inner segment mix difference at that point. But motion would have grown this year slightly under the segment average. So really, it was a pretty tight band within A&S this quarter, not a big swing between the different businesses within there. Good, solid safety growth. Obviously, solid Logix growth. And the peripheral products, which would be motion -- really motion and sensing, motion slightly under and sensing basically right at.","Theodore D. Crandall","Rick, in the year-over-year causal, margin causal on A&S, there really wasn't much of a -- there wasn't much of a significant mix impact.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So in the 80 bps improvement, that's not necessarily mix. It's more volume and leverage?","Theodore D. Crandall","Correct.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then could I just ask in terms of the orders on the Solutions piece of CP&S, was order growth -- how did that look in the quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","The book to bill was 1.1 in the quarter. So once again, 2 very good quarters of above 1 growth in our Solutions business, which is why, basically, Ted commented about the second half and the mix shift favoring more to Solutions. It's because of that backlog that we built after getting ourselves to hold in the third and fourth quarter of last year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I understand. And then just as a related question. I\u2019m going to relate this just so I can sneak it in. But the growth investment in the second quarter, we had talked in the first quarter that you basically delayed some of the first quarter growth investment. Did -- if you look at that, the growth investment that you made in the second quarter, does that kind of true up your year-to-date investments? In other words, was it heavier in the second quarter since we kind of delayed the first quarter investment?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, there were 2 things. When we talk about spending Q1 to Q2, so sequential change, probably the largest impact was just the merit increases that we normally put through in January. There was additional incremental spending increase sequentially beyond that. I don't think I would say we caught up year-to-date from some under-spending in Q1. If anything, we're probably still a little bit below where we thought we would be for the first half.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. That's going to conclude today's call. I'm available for follow-up calls, and so thank you again.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. At this time, you may disconnect.

Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our President and CEO and Patrick Goris, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck.","This was another strong quarter for us. Organic growth was 8%, which was in line with our expectations. I'm pleased to see that this growth was broad-based across the regions and industries. Globally, transportation continued to deliver very good growth. In consumer, food and beverage did well. Heavy industries were also up in the quarter, including good growth in semiconductor. Overall, the macroeconomic environment remains solid.","From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market grew 8%. We saw growth in most verticals led by strong performance in transportation. EMEA was flat year-over-year, as expected. The timing of projects is driving some quarter-to-quarter variability in our growth rates.","Asia grew over 20%. We saw growth in most verticals led by semiconductor. Most countries in the region were up including China, which grew about 20%. Latin America grew 12% with strong growth in Mexico.","I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Acquisitions add 1.2 points of sales growth. ACP and MAVERICK are contributing technology innovation and domain expertise, and are accretive to earnings. Our process business improved and was up 8% year-over-year organically. Including MAVERICK, process was up double-digits.","Architecture & Software had another strong quarter with 10.5% organic growth. Within this segment, Logix was up 10% compared to last year. This was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth.","Patrick will elaborate on Q3 financial performance in his remarks. We are pleased with our sales and earnings performance in the quarter.","Let's move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017. As I said earlier, the macro outlook remains solid. Recent projections of industrial production growth are largely unchanged from a quarter ago. We expect continued growth in transportation and consumer. We expect heavy industry in total to be up low single-digits for the year, consistent with our April guidance. We are still not counting on growth from oil and gas and mining for full year fiscal 2017.","Turning to guidance, considering the macro outlook and our results through three quarters, we continue to expect fiscal 2017 organic sales growth of approximately 6%. We now project fiscal 2017 sales of approximately $6.3 billion, slightly higher than prior guidance due to currency.","Based on our third quarter earnings performance, we are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range. The new range is $6.60 to $6.80. At the midpoint, this represents 13% adjusted EPS growth for the year. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it back over to Patrick, let me add a few comments. Our Connected Enterprise strategy is working and positions us well for the future. The pilots continued to deliver tangible results across multiple industries, and we are seeing customers expand pilots to more lines and facilities. We will remain focused as a single integrated business, helping our customers succeed in the global market by enabling them to be more productive and therefore, more competitive. Our extent of industry knowledge and domain expertise help us deliver value based on each customer's needs.","I want to highlight a couple of items. First, an important announcement we made in June. We will be working in partnership with ManpowerGroup to upskill military veterans, investing in the future workforce and creating a pool of certified talent for in-demand advanced manufacturing roles across the United States.","According to a recent survey, most U.S. employers think automation will increase, not decrease, manufacturing head count, but at a higher skill level. No matter how much you automate, people remain our and our customers' most important asset.","Second, I'd like to remind you that Automation Fair is in Houston this year, and we'll be holding our Investor Meeting on Thursday, November 16. Although Automation Fair is a customer event, it's a great opportunity for investors and analysts to deepen their understanding of automation and learn more about our capabilities as well as those of our partners. We will show how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life and delivering more value than ever before to our customers around the world. So please mark your calendars, and we hope to see you all there.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment to serving our customers.","With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Blake and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, third quarter key financial information. As Blake mentioned, we had a good sales performance in the quarter with reported sales up 8.5%. As expected, organic growth was 8.2%. Our two acquisitions from last September contributed 1.2 points of sales growth. MagneMotion which was acquired in March 2016 is now included in organic growth. Currency translation reduced sales by 0.9% in the quarter.","Segment operating margin of 21.1% was flat compared to last year. A margin tailwind from strong organic growth and good productivity performance was offset by the restoration of incentive compensation and increased investment spending.","General corporate-net expense of $17 million was also flat year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up $0.21 compared to the third quarter of last year, an increase of 13.5%. The increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to higher sales, good productivity and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and investment spending.","As I mentioned, the tax rate in the quarter was lower than last year. The adjusted effective tax rate was about 270 basis points lower, as a result of some favorable discrete tax items contributing about $0.06 of adjusted EPS.","We are pleased with continued good free cash flow performance. Free cash flow in the quarter was $285 million, or 124% of adjusted income. 12 month trailing return on invested capital was 38.8%.","A few additional items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.9 million, down $900,000 or less than 1% compared to last year. And we repurchased about 740,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $116.1 million. Through three quarters, we're basically on track to spend $400 million on share repurchases this fiscal year. At June 30th, we had $643 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Moving on to slide 5, sales and margin performance of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another very good quarter with 9.8% sales growth. Organic sales were up 10.5% year-over-year, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 0.3%.","Segment margin improved 0.3 points from 27.6% to 27.9% year-over-year. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth and good productivity were partially offset by higher incentive compensation. And as expected, spending was up year-over-year mostly driven by increased R&D.","Finally, currency was a bit less than a point headwind to margins in this segment. Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Control Products & Solutions segment. We saw a good pickup in growth in this segment with reported sales up 7.4%. Organic sales were up 6.3%. Currency translation reduced sales by 0.8% and acquisitions contributed almost 2%.","Solutions and services organic sales growth turned positive in this segment, up over 4%. The product businesses in this segment were up about 9% on an organic basis. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 1.02 in Q3 compared to 1.04 a year ago. As expected, operating margin for this segment improved compared to the second quarter. Segment margin of 15.3% was down 40 basis points compared to Q3 of last year, primarily due to higher incentive comp more than offsetting leverage associated with sales growth.","The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks, so I will skip this slide, which takes us to the next slide, the guidance slide. As Blake mentioned, we are revising our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2017.","We now project sales of about $6.3 billion compared to $6.25 billion in the April guidance, an increase of less than $50 million due to a smaller headwind of currency translation. Based on currency rates, the full year headwind from currency is expected to be about 0.5 point. We continue to project organic sales growth of about 6% and our outlook for the sales contribution from acquisitions remains unchanged at 1.5%. We expect segment operating margin to be a little below 20.5%.","We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 21%, mainly a reflection of the lower tax rate in the third quarter of this fiscal year. This would imply a Q4 tax rate of around 25%, which is closer to our underlying tax rate. The adjusted EPS guidance range is now $6.60 to $6.80. At the midpoint, this reflects a $0.10 increase from the April guidance. The increase in EPS guidance at the midpoint mainly reflects a lower expected tax rate. A modest EPS benefit associated with the smaller currency translation headwind is offset by higher incentive compensation associated with the EPS guidance increase. We now expect free cash flow conversion to be over 115% of adjusted income for the year.","And a couple of other items, general corporate-net is expected to be a little below $75 million for the full year. And finally, consistent with our April guidance, we continue to expect average fully diluted shares outstanding to be $129.9 million.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get as many of you as possible on the call, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.

How did China do \u2013 China was up 20%, how did China fair, heavy industry versus consumer-facing industries and could you comment on the trend of sustainability in China?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. I'd say, John, the growth we had in China was broad-based. We saw growth in some heavy industries, particularly semiconductor but also mining and metals, growth in infrastructure as well. We saw good growth in transportation, particularly in tire, and actually auto was up which was better than what we expected in that country for the quarter. Finally, food and beverage within consumer was also up a bit. So I'd say broad-based in China, including in some heavy industries, but you didn't hear me mention oil and gas.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So I mean, historically or at least in recent years, China consumer has been sort of the bright spot as heavy industry has been negatively pressured. Are you suggesting that there's balance in growth or is consumer still significantly ahead of heavy industry, but heavy industry is catching up? I mean, just a little more color would be great, Patrick.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I'd say it's more balanced than before. Before, it was mostly driven by transportation and consumer. This quarter we see significant growth in some of the heavy industry verticals in China.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think what we are seeing in a positive sense is diversification. So we haven't talked as much about semiconductor in the past, but that was significant. And that also is a big part of the automation market and metals has actually been positive for us in China. We still look at China as fundamentally a two-speed economy where consumer, transportation, life sciences are growing faster in general, but some of the areas of heavy industries other than oil and gas are picking up.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. Thanks for that. Is Rockwell hiring? And the context of my question is we've obviously been through this multi-period lull and now obviously growth is much better. And if you are hiring, that would sort of speak to, I guess, just sort of your own conviction in the outlook. I mean, are you hiring and does this pose any kind of incremental headwind the way, say, comp is this year?","And sort of the corollary of the question is are there any headwinds that you would call out as we head into 2018 that are going to be noteworthy to say the way compensation was, or anything that just we should \u2013 as we sort of think of our modeling, should be sort of cognizant of?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No, is the short answer. I mean, at mid-single digits growth in fiscal year 2018, that would \u2013 the return to incentive comp would cease to be a headwind to us in the fiscal year. Regarding whether we're hiring or not, we are but we're balancing. So, my staff is looking for areas that bring us additional growth, but also looking at areas that aren't as important anymore.","And so while the net increase is not large, we're constantly dynamically rebalancing where we need people, whether it's customer-facing employees, whether it's software developers. And so we are in the market and actively hiring, but we're also balancing to make sure that we don't create additional headwinds.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, Blake, all else equal, you return to mid-single digit, kind of your scenario where we would expect to go back to kind of a 30% to 40% variable contribution under that framework just based on your comments?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, John. 30% to 35% is the range we've shared before.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","That's right.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, John.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Oh, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wanted to kind of just I guess a follow on \u2013 on back to John's question there. So I think you called out FX as a one point hurt to A&S margins. I think you mentioned that, Patrick. Can you maybe just describe what impact FX is having? Is this mainly just due to the hedge movements or is there some geographic mix on sales? Any help, that would be good.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I don't think that this is an ongoing headwind. We had some significant changes during the quarter related to currency. That is impacting that. And then of course, benefit from the hedges year-over-year for this segment was a little bit less.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So the hedge impact will sort of normalize over the next couple of quarters or so?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. From an overall company perspective, the impact of hedges was about $1 million which was about neutral year-over-year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. That's great. And then as I think about the investment spending, obviously, you've been talking about investment spending for some time now, but as you're launching your cloud analytics layer, is the investment spending a little bit heavier than normal or is it still very much in the run rate?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It really is in the run rate. And as I mentioned before, as we're hiring people, we're prioritizing. So there's always a longer list of developments whether it's building out that information platform or it's our core developments in Logix and our intelligent motor control platform. There's always going to be a longer list than we're going to get to in terms of development. So we're asking our teams to prioritize. There is additional spend that's going to the information side, including the cloud but not just that.","And as we talked about in the past, there's going to be a mix of organic development. It's a focus area for acquisitions and also leveraging the technology from our partners to make sure that that development burden on Rockwell doesn't become oversized.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. A quick modeling question. You've described the tax rate of 25% normalized. Is that the rate we should use for next year, Patrick?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think that will be in the range for next year at 25%, 26%, in that range. Yeah.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Nigel.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Rick.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Blake, could you speak to the transportation vertical in the quarter, but specifically to the auto? And I'm curious, if we could have a growth rate on the auto and the influence geographically of auto. I presume it's Mexico and U.S.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I'll make some comments, and then Patrick will follow up with some additional color. One of the things that we're particularly proud of with auto, which is over 20% in the quarter, is the diversity of where that's coming from. So powertrain is actually performing a little bit better than our expectations. EV, so electric vehicle around the world is a material contributor including in Asia. And so those are very encouraging to us. In terms of traditional internal combustion automotive, that's fairly well balanced around the world, and it's a mix of the brand owners seeking to expand into new geographies, as well as the more frequent model changeovers that we've talked about in the past. And so that diversity has contributed significantly to our growth year-to-date.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Rick, Blake mentioned that auto is up over 20% year-over-year in Q3. Actually, we saw double-digit growth in auto in every region except in Latin America in this quarter.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So it's broad-based across different regions.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just out of curiosity, you mentioned EVs, but is the \u2013 I know Rockwell has some content on the automation side at Tesla and the Model 3, in addition to the battery assembly operations, kind of the gigaplant they have. But is there any pull forward, if you will, of automation spend given the timing on their launch with that model? Is that a noticeable blip in the third quarter and perhaps even the second quarter for auto?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I don't think we can really attribute that growth to that specific brand owner. What we're seeing is a lot of activity at the tier suppliers for EV around the world, not just for Tesla. And so it's broad-based. There's a lot of new companies seeking to participate in that business, and we're serving a lot of them. So, I would not attribute it exclusively to the model rebuild now.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just last question and a follow-up. Within the CP&S business, when I look at the quarter-to-quarter incremental profitability for CP&S, what would you attribute that to? Is that to the product growth there being greater than the solutions or...","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Rick, you're looking year-over-year? Or you're looking sequentially?","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I'm looking from the second quarter to the third quarter, the step up in profitability. I mean, incremental was like 85%.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. There's a couple of things. One is volume is up, right? So that is helping, we get leverage from volume. But also in the second quarter, you may recall we had the year-to-date adjustment related to incentive compensation. So we had an unusually high incentive compensation expense. We don't have that high of a headwind in the...","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","In the third.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","... in the third quarter compared to the second. So think about volume leverage and then lower bonus incentive compensation.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","In the third versus second. Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Correct.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you maybe just talk about kind of what's going on in the U.S. automotive, specifically in the context of the current production schedules and then just what your customers are telling you on CapEx. I know Ford's cash was a little bit weak today, and they've been spending pretty heavily. Any kind of insights that they're giving you on \u2013 and there's also been some management changes. Any kind of insights that they're giving you on their plans for the next couple of years?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We've talked before about a relatively good visibility on automotive programs that goes out for a period of years and confirming the intention of continuing to spend on those programs with the brand owners, with the tier suppliers. We see that as continued strong for the foreseeable future. So certainly through the end of the year, but also beyond. And, again, the spend with us is primarily on some of the items that I mentioned before about model changes and expansion geographically. Over time, a reduced SAAR is going to impact us, but we continue to see strong revenue for the foreseeable future.","The other thing I mentioned about the U.S. market is that's been a particularly a fertile ground for us in the information and Connected Enterprise pilots. So a lot of these brand owners are already using our smart products, our Logix and so on, but they're adding the information on top in some of the associated services. So that's additional customer share that we're seeing even in existing operation. So even when they're not going through a model change or capacity expansion as they seek to get better visibility into their production, reducing unplanned downtime, and some of the other key drivers of that new value.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. When you mix this kind of all-in and you think about the \u2013 you're guiding to kind of 6% now for the year. It looks like the fourth quarter is in that kind of 5.5% to 6% range. Does that feel like the type of economy we're in? Is your ability to kind of sustain \u2013 I guess, if I look at just general industrial activity at least across my sector, the organic seems to be in kind of the 3% range in maybe a 2% to 3% economy. Does this 5% to 6% growth rate kind of seem like, hey, this is sustainably what we can do given this market outgrowth in auto and the consumer dynamics in China, et cetera. Anything unusual about kind of this year's growth rate or this is what you expect going forward?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, without guiding to fiscal year 2018 organic growth...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I didn't ask that, by the way. Just kidding.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The macroeconomic indicators are solid. So PMI continued strong in most spots around the world. Industrial production continue, so largely unchanged from the last quarter. So we do feel like we're in a period of expansion.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to figure out \u2013 I just want to follow up on some auto, a little different tact here. With European diesel penetration coming in pretty significantly versus expectation, a lot of the plans focused on EV and gas-powered trains. The transition in Europe over the next few years, is that net positive content-wise for Rockwell?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I don't know that we've modeled the mix between the various transitions. There's some puts and takes in terms of the different parts of the assembly in powertrain process. Some require a little more automation, some a little less. I think the biggest single factor is expansion to new customers. So capitalizing on some of the openings we have within the brand owners, continued coverage in the tier suppliers around the world, release of new products that makes a difference, continuing to add value to our partnership with FANUC and others. I think those will have a bigger impact on our revenue growth than the pure split of automation content between EV and IC assembly.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So share of wallet is more important than kind of neutral in terms of powertrain mix.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Both customer share and the acquisition of new customers.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Okay. All right. And then as you look through the quarter, anything noteworthy in terms of trends in the U.S. market, in terms of the months and how things trended versus expectation?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No, Rich. I'd say it was a typical quarter. We always start the quarter a little bit slow, and then it picks up during the quarter, and that's what we saw in Q3.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just a finer point on the guide for the balance of the year, typically your EPS in FQ4 is fairly similar to FQ3. You have a little bit tougher year-over-year organic growth rate in FQ4 versus FQ3, but seems like the FQ4 organic growth rate is somewhere around 5%. So just trying to gauge whether it's mix in there, conservatism, what kind of wouldn't keep you from getting close to FQ3 EPS?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So in Q4, we expect a little bit of a benefit compared to Q3 related to volume. Some of that \u2013 typically in Q4 is a pickup in our solutions business which tends to have somewhat of a negative mix impact. One of the items that's impacting Q4 is we expect our spending to be up sequentially and year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","And so that is impacting the Q3 to Q4 performance from an earnings perspective. And then of course from an EPS perspective, we expect a somewhat higher tax rate in the fourth quarter which has a negative impact on EPS.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Maybe first just to pick up on that point, Patrick. So it did sound like when you were talking about the guide raise, you were talking about some offsets and incremental spend. It sounds like it's in the fourth quarter. But, I mean, Blake said earlier, it's in the base. But relative to what you were expecting, say, a quarter ago, is there now an elevated level of spending in the guide for 2017?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No, Jeff. There is not. The only, call it, increase we have is really related to incentive compensation. We increased the guide at the midpoint by about $0.10, and so there's a little bit more incentive compensation associated with that. And basically, that is being offset by the tailwind we get from a lower headwind of currency translation. Those two kind of net out.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And similar to Q2, although there's less year left to catch up on, is there \u2013 the Q3 then reflect kind of a catch-up year-to-date then on the higher incentive comp number?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. But it's a much smaller number, Jeff. So last quarter, I said that for the full year, the year-over-year increase is about $110 million, $115 million. Now it's about $5 million higher for the full year. And of that, $3 million was reflected in Q3, a little bit over $3 million, and the rest was reflected in \u2013 will be booked in Q4.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So much smaller numbers.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then just thinking about A&S specifically, give us a read on how A&S performed in the U.S.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So A&S, we said, was up organically 10.5% year-over-year. In the U.S. it was above that.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And in Europe, these projects that you're talking about that have caused some timing influence, a little bit of color on what's going on there and how you see that playing going forward?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think there's a little bit of movement between the different OEMs, for instance, in Europe. We continue to see very good adoption and good growth in our CompactLogix platform at a broad range of OEMs.","The variability was really customer-specific. Some of our traditional customers may have purchased a little bit less in the quarter while we're building at some of the newer machinery builders. So that's really the majority of the variability.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one last one for me. At the midpoint of your range in your free cash flow conversion, you actually have raised your free cash flow per share $0.80 for the year, roughly. What is driving that?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, we have \u2013 first of all, from a free cash flow performance, what's helping us from a conversion point of view is the fact that we are accruing bonus which won't be get paid out till the first quarter of fiscal 2018.","So that's worth about 10 points or so of conversion. And then the other thing that's helping really from a cash flow generation point of view, not the conversion, is that we're increasing our net income \u2013 our earnings performance for the year.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. But on incentive comp, you only went up $5 million from Q2 to Q3.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Oh. Yes. I think you're referring to going from 105% to 115%?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think, it's having another good quarter of cash flow conversion behind us. That's the main driver, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Morning. Just a first question on A&S globally. You saw the organic sales growth. It was very good again in Q3, a little bit slower than Q2 off a tougher comp a year ago. So when you're looking at revenue growth outlook in that segment, should we expect that just to drift off as your comps get a lot tougher into the calendar fourth quarter and just looking out over six months, or is there any actual improvement in real end demand going on, or is end demand all-in pretty stable and it's just a function of comps driving your growth rate now?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Julian, I think we see continued strength and growth, but the year-over-year growth rates will moderate because, as you say, the comps get tougher.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I would also say we do feel confident that we're gaining share in core platforms. So at the growth we're seeing and comparing it against what external measures are available, we think we're taking share in A&S products.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. And looking at your sort of fourth quarter, should we expect that CP&S can hold the organic growth rate it saw in Q3 at about 6%?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It might be a little less than that. Yes. I would say similar, maybe a little.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. And then lastly, a quick one. This is normally an issue for Rockwell, but so many electrical companies have mentioned some challenges around price or price cost in the last 10 days or so. I wonder if you were seeing any change in pricing dynamics in any particular region or product category right now?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No. We're in an intensively competitive market. I think we're guiding to a little less than a point of price because we're an asset light business, and mainly trade on intellectual capital, cost headwinds are not a significant new headwind for us.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning, Blake and Patrick.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Can you guys touch a little bit about what you're seeing in Europe? So in fiscal second quarter, you saw some good acceleration and I fully appreciate that the comps were tougher in fiscal 3Q. But maybe just a little bit more color on the slightly negative growth that you saw in Europe this quarter?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think as Blake mentioned earlier, actually, the growth in EMEA came in as we expected. And I would say that what we are seeing in the region is the timing of projects is driving some variability in our quarterly growth rates. We're not seeing an underlying trend that's different than what we expected. It's more related to timing of some of the projects we have throughout our businesses. We still expect to grow in EMEA for the full year. It's going to be below the company average. So that has not changed. And there are areas in EMEA where we continue to do well, for example, with machine builders and our mid-range controller family.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We also continue to see growth in the emerging parts of Europe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And were there any particular areas within Europe that were weaker than you expected this quarter?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, every quarter, there is some variability. In this case, we saw good growth in emerging Europe, and some of the Western European countries were a little bit less than what we expected. But I wouldn't read too much into that. I think that's normal quarterly variability that we see all the time.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then you typically \u2013 you mentioned earlier on the call that you typically don't talk about the semiconductor space. I think it's a relatively small piece of your business. So maybe to the extent that you can quantify what percentage of sales semis is for you guys? And then more specifically, one of the trends we've seen this year is just electronic CapEx has been up a lot. So to the extent that you can just comment on cyclical versus potentially sustainable or structural growth in that industry, that would be helpful.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So first of all, semiconductor and electronic manufacturing and assembly are roughly 5% of our sales. And as you pointed out, they are in a period of investment. That's the chip production, that's the glass panel fabs. We have a particular strength in the facility management control system. So the environmental controls that are so important to those kinds of advanced manufacturing processes are an area that we're quite strong in. Characterized growth centered in Asia, in the U.S. especially, and they are in a period of good spend that's predicted to continue for a while, but there will be a certain cyclical element of that.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And you mentioned, just maybe follow-on there, you mentioned that China was up about 20%. What was your semiconductor business up this quarter?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","You mean, specifically within China?","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It was a little bit more than that. Actually, it was \u2013 yes, it was more than that in China.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","One of the things that contributes to the growth as well is for a lot of that business, it involves value add as well. So engineering services, panel fabrication. So it's not just the loose products, but it's also the value add that increases the value of those sales.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Joe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Solutions and services, which went down 3% last quarter, I think up 4% you said this quarter. We know solutions is big in heavy industries. You already mentioned that you still expect heavy industries to be up low-single digits for the year. Is there any evidence though that it is accelerating a little? I mean I know you mentioned nothing really going on in oil and gas. What about mining or some of the other segments of heavy industries? What contributed to that sort of inflection in the solutions business?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. It's still variable around the world. So we mentioned last quarter that we are seeing a bit of a improvement in mining in Asia, for instance, but we're not ready to call it broad-based around the world. We still see pressure from lower commodity prices like copper still below $3 a pound, and we're still dealing with overcapacity in steel, that's putting pressure on that.","That being said, we've got some bright spots. So metals has been relatively strong as customers modernize and, in some cases, consolidate facilities but adding automation. In North America, the lower cost of feedstock in natural gas is giving us good growth in chemical. So it's spotty around the world. We're not ready to call a general recovery, but there are spots that have contributed to that relatively improved performance in solutions and services.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Andy, obviously, what's helping us is that some of those heavy industries are not as a significant drag now than they were a year ago or several quarters ago.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, guys. And, Blake, maybe somewhat related, process was up 8% in the quarter, which continued to improve from last quarter. Would you say that pickup in growth is more Rockwell-specific based on things like your hybrid control offerings, or is it just the process markets themselves are improving?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think it's both. I mentioned before the chemical market. Certainly, the continued evolution of our PlantPAx control platform has helped. It's going to continue to help. We've got a lot of developments lined up over the next few years that are going to increase our competitiveness there. But at least is important is the domain expertise. So we're better able to serve, for instance, the chemical market because of the MAVERICK acquisition. And that domain expertise is absolutely critical to foster the trust in those customers that we know how to address their mission critical applications. So I'd really say it's a mix of our improved ability to serve the market, as well as a recovery in some areas and some diversification in terms of our ability to address additional process control applications.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right.

And how are you seeing those pilot programs as they transition to full-scale deployment?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Happy to do that. As we've talked about, we're very pleased with the evolution of these pilots. We have a couple dozen that we're formally tracking across different industries and different parts of the world. We've made some public announcements about a few of those, Metso, in the mining world as we partner with them, in conjunction with Microsoft, to be able to enhance their ability to add value to end user customers in areas like remote monitoring.","Great Lakes Brewing, craft brewery located in Cleveland, is using some of our device-level analytics and some of our reporting tools to get better production visibility. Again, that's one that we're working with Microsoft to deliver that value for them. It's a great story. It's giving value to that individual customer, but it's also something that will, no doubt, expand to other similar operations. It's an easy way to get started and to get the value from the Connected Enterprise, from that integrated control and information without having to send all the data to the cloud in a very expensive and high-risk type of application.","In oil and gas, we've talked about companies like Shell in the past that continue to expand their use of our information solutions and connected services. So really across industries and across geographies, we're happy with the evolution.","In terms of quantifying the specific value, we think it's contributing to our very strong product growth as customers put that foundation in place. That's where the data comes from. But also we still believe that we're on track to deliver double-digit growth from some of the areas of new value in the Connected Enterprise, the information solutions, and the connected services that customers turn to as they try to integrate that control and information.","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","No, that's very helpful. And then just sort of as my follow-up, we saw another great quarter of cash generation, continuing to generate just tremendous amount of cash on the balance sheet. So in light of that, how are you thinking about capital deployment priorities at this stage?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. That has not changed. So we'll fund our organic growth, that's priority number one. We continue to look for acquisitions that have a very good strategic fit and that will help us grow faster organically as well. And then after that, we continue to target a dividend with a yield and payout that's at the median of our peers. And finally after that, we return cash through share repurchases. So that remains very consistent.","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Bergner with Gabelli & Company. Your line is now open.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Justin. Good morning.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","First question relates to oil and gas. I guess, I'm not sure if you broke out how oil and gas performed in the quarter. And then secondly, was that really the only market that maybe didn't do as well as you expected in the June quarter or were there other markets that sort of fell short of your expectations?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Actually, I'd say that oil and gas for us in the quarter, just like mining, they were actually up a little, call it low single-digit. But we think it's more maybe some hovering around the bottom than anything more than that. We're not seeing a big turnaround yet in those verticals.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. And so the ones we typically talk about and we've talking about together over the last couple of quarters has been oil and gas and then a broad-based mining recovery. And going back a few years, we were used to outsize growth in those areas. And even though we did see low single-digit growth in mining and oil and gas in the quarter, we're not ready to call a general inflection point across the world.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","That's why we continue to believe and our guidance continues to assume no year-over-year growth for the full year for both of these verticals.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Second would be on the question of currency tailwinds. I mean, you mentioned that you're going to have about $5 million of incentive comp, and that will be more or less offset by the FX tailwinds over the quarter just completed and the September quarter.","I mean, should we think about the FX tailwind sort of picking up as we get into fiscal year 2018 if exchange rates stay at current levels? And sort of what will be the puts and takes to think about how the changing currency environment will affect profitability going forward?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So we're not necessarily known for being good forecasters of currency. But at the current levels of currency, instead of having a tailwind, it could be a small \u2013 instead of having a headwind like we have this year, it could be somewhat of a positive. It's still early. Currencies move around, and we'll share with you in November what our assumptions are for fiscal 2018.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you. And then finally, just \u2013 Latin American strength has been exceptional. I mean, it continues to be exceptional. I know, it's something a lot of people take for granted, but it's really a strong point of the company in this quarter in particular. Is there any dynamic there that is worth highlighting given the strong comp? And obviously, Brazil is not particularly rosy now so the strong results stands out even further.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, I agree. It is remarkable. It's a source of traditional strength for the company. A lot of that growth has been centered recently in Mexico as Brazil and Venezuela, among others, deal with continuing political uncertainty. And we enjoy in Mexico and in some countries diverse space. So it's not just the heavy industry, but it's automotive, it's food\/beverage, tire manufacturers are locating in Latin America. So those would be a few additional comments about that growth. But it's a source of pride for us. So we have that relatively strong share in Latin America.","Justin Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Thanks for fitting my questions in, or questions. I guess, the first question is maybe following up on capital allocation. I mean, obviously, we haven't gotten much in the way of policy traction for the Trump administrational on tax and there's the limited visibility there, particularly with respect to repatriation. But at some point, is there urgency to kind of come up with new framework for your capital allocation given the prevailing environment? I mean, do you think you have to, just to put a finer point on what kind of your priorities are or sizing the priorities in terms of capital allocation or bringing back cash? I mean, could we talk about that for a little bit?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think, the answer is, Rob, that we \u2013 obviously, we look forward to potential tax reform including the lower rates, including an opportunity to repatriate cash, including moving towards a territorial tax system. But absent that, we can continue doing what we have been doing for the last several years. There is no need for us to repatriate the cash that's overseas. It's permanently reinvested there. And as our cash needs in the U.S. are larger than our cash generation, we continue to gross up the balance sheet. And so there is no need for us to change it at this time. The one item that could change that is if for some reason our credit rating would come into play, but I think we're still far away from that.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow up, in terms of the acquisition opportunity and landscape, this is kind of two questions tied together. I guess, Blake, where do you see the most opportunity to structurally improve some of your businesses from a domain expertise standpoint or from distribution or geographic distribution? Where do you see the biggest opportunities for M&A or collaboration?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Well, just to reiterate, when we look at acquisitions, we look at their ability to accelerate our technology innovation, our domain expertise and\/or our market access. And the best ones bring us benefits in multiple of those dimensions.","On the technology side, information solutions is a particularly interesting area for us. In domain expertise, process continues to be an important opportunity for us. And then market access, as you would expect in some places, Asia, Europe where we have lower relative share, there are opportunities there as well.","We're looking at our acquisition pipeline which is robust, first, in terms of the strategic fit in those dimensions, and we're satisfied and optimistic that what we've talked about before as our ability to grow on top line, have accretive acquisitions, but most importantly have them contribute to the strategy in areas like information management, analytics and so on.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'll leave it there. Congratulations on a good quarter.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris","Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our CFO.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our Web site. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that Web site for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Patrick. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I suspect by now that you have read the press release that was issued last week Tuesday. I will be stepping down from the role of President and CEO of Rockwell Automation on June 30. And effective July 1, Blake Moret will succeed me and become President and CEO of the company. I will remain Chairman of the Board.","Blake has been with the company for over 30 years and has gathered a wealth of experience across the organization, including sales management, business management positions in both segments, and international assignments. He brings a strong customer focus as well as a deep understanding of our values, people, and technology. He has proven himself to be an exceptional leader with demonstrated readiness to lead the company. Blake is the ideal executive to move our company forward.","I know many of you have had the opportunity to meet Blake over the last few years. In the coming months, we will find opportunities for Blake to meet with investors in his new role.","With that, I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to page three in the slide deck. The quarter generally played out as we expected, with organic sales down about 3.5%, heavy industry end markets remained very weak globally, lead by oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas was down a little over 20% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Consumer and auto verticals saw low to mid-single-digit growth.","In the US, oil and gas, again, was the weakest vertical. The US is a region where we have seen the largest decline in oil and gas. Food and beverage was one of the stronger verticals and automotive was flat.","In China, strong growth in automotive was more than offset by continued weakness in heavy industries and tire. Sales in China were down a little over 10% year-over-year. Clearly, the US and China remain our most challenging geographies. However, sales in both the US and China increased modestly compared to last quarter.","EMEA was about flat in the quarter, but built backlog. We expect to return to low-single-digit growth for the balance of the year. Home and personal care and life sciences remain the strongest verticals in this region.","I\u2019m pleased with continued strength in Latin America, led by Mexico.","Let me add another couple of points on the quarter. Weak heavy industries continued to affect our process business, which was down high teens in the quarter. Logix sales declined over 5% in the quarter, reflecting the weakness in process industries.","And segment margin was 19.3% in the quarter. This is a bit lower than we expected. However, I was pleased that the Control Products & Solutions segment maintained its margin despite lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 financial performance, including our segment margins in his results \u2013 in his remarks, excuse me.","Let me add a couple of brief comments about our first half before moving on to our outlook for the fiscal year. Organic sales declined 3.5%. Heavy industry verticals were down globally. And growth in Latin America and EMEA was offset by declines in the US and China. I\u2019m pleased that we have been able to keep segment margins at 20%, despite 8% lower sales.","And we are very proud to have received the Ethisphere award for the eighth time, naming us as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.","Let\u2019s move on to what I expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecast has called for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, but continue to indicate some modest improvement in the second half of our fiscal year.","Also, since we provided guidance in January, oil and commodity prices seem to have stabilized. Another welcome change is the stability and modest weakening of the US dollar since January. As we mentioned last quarter, the strong US dollar has adversely impacted US-based producers and equipment builders.","So given that the macro environment has remained relatively stable, we believe that our performance in the balance of the year will be in line with what we projected in January, modest sequential improvement, but no year-over-year growth.","Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak with some continued growth in the consumer and automotive verticals. The US and China will remain our weakest geographies. We expect continued growth in EMEA and believe Latin America will remain our fastest growth region for the year.","Taking all these factors into consideration and with two quarters to go, we are narrowing our fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance range to down 1.5% to 4.5%. No change to the midpoint. We continue to expect fiscal 2016 sales of about 5.9 billion and are narrowing the EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $6.15. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few closing comments. As I travel and meet with customers and partners around the world, I\u2019m confident that our vision of The Connected Enterprise is coming alive. Early adoption of our new technology is promising and customers realize that our new high-performance architecture optimizes their business performance and makes them more globally competitive.","Whether our customer is focused on expansion or productivity, CapEx or OpEx, our technology is equally relevant. Innovation, new product development, and domain expertise are the lifeblood of our company and we continue to invest to enhance our differentiation.","I\u2019m very excited about The Connected Enterprise and could not be more confident about the future success of Rockwell Automation.","With that, let me turn it over to Ted.","Ted Crandall","Thank you, Keith. And good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll begin my comments on page four, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were 1.440 billion, down 7.1% compared to Q2 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.6%. That\u2019s similar to the organic decline that we saw in Q1. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.5%. This quarter, we lapped some of the larger currency rate differences.","Segment operating margin was 19.3%, down 2.3 points from Q2 last year, primarily due to lower sales, some unfavorable mix, primarily in the Architecture & Software segment and a negative impact from currency.","General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q2 compared to $21 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.37, down $0.22, or about 14% compared to the second quarter of last year.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7% compared to 26% in Q2 last year. The lower effective rate this year is primarily due to the recognition of a discrete tax item. ","Free cash flow for Q2 was $203 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 113%. Through six months, free cash flow was $348 million with related conversion on adjusted income of 92%.","Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32%.","A couple of items not shown on the slide, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 101.3 million, down over 3% compared to last year.","During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $127 million. Through the first six months, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $248 million. In November, we projected repurchases for the full year, totaling $500 million. We are on that pace.","At the end of March, we had $197 million remaining on our then-existing share repurchase authorization. And on April 4, our Board of Directors approved an additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization.","The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment for the second quarter and year-to-date. Page five is the Architecture & Software segment and I\u2019ll focus my comments on the quarter.","Beginning on the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $630 million in Q2, down 6.6% compared to Q2 last year. The organic sales decline was 3.3% and currency translation also reduced sales by 3.3%.","Moving to the right side of the chart, on the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 24.6%, down 5.2 points from Q2 last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to lower sales volume, negative currency effects, some mix headwinds within the segment, and increased spending. The margin result was about a point worse than we expected in the quarter.","On a year-over-year basis, the largest unfavorable mix factor is related to a larger decline in controller and software businesses compared to the balance of the segment. The controller and software businesses are the highest margin business within this high margin segment.","As expected, spending is also up modestly year-over-year in Architecture & Software, despite sales being down. The spending increase is primarily related to new product development and we remain committed to investment in key technologies even in these more difficult market conditions.","We expect to see continued mix headwind in the Architecture & Software segment over the balance of the year. However, we expect some sequential sales growth into the second half and consequently expect Q2 to be our lowest margin quarter this year in this segment. ","Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment, in the second quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $811 million, down 7.5% year-over-year and down 3.9% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%.","Sales in the product businesses and the solutions and service businesses within the segment were each down about 4% organically.","The book-to-bill in Q2 for solutions and services was 0.98. That\u2019s weaker than we expected and reflects continued weakness in heavy industries.","The Control Products & Solutions segment continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.2% in Q2, flat to Q2 last year, despite the lower sales.","Turning to page seven, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter and year-to-date. Keith covered the quarter in his comments and the year-to-date performance pretty much mirrors the second quarter, so I\u2019ll move to the next slide.","And that takes us to guidance. As Keith mentioned, there are a couple of adjustments to the guidance. We\u2019ve narrowed the range for both organic sales and adjusted EPS. That\u2019s pretty typical for us to do at this point in the year. For organic growth, the midpoint remains at minus 3%, but the new range is minus 1.5% to minus 4.5%. ","For currency translation, due to a recent weakening of the US dollar compared to several currencies, we now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3% rather than about 4% in the previous guidance. That takes us back to the level of the original November guidance.","We still expect reported sales to be about $5.9 billion. With the improvement in currency translation, we went from a little below that number to a little above that number. ","Regarding segment operating margin, we now expect that to be a little lower than 20.5%. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of about 25%. We\u2019re narrowing adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $5.75 to $6.15, with the same $5.95 midpoint.","We continue to expect to convert about 100% of adjusted income to free cash flow. And there are a couple of items not shown here. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session.","Patrick Goris","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we\u2019d like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. ","John Inch","Good morning, everyone. ","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Keith, congratulations on an incredible career. And, Blake, congratulations. ","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","John Inch","You\u2019re welcome. So let me start with Apple missing Consumer Electronics this week. 3M called this out yesterday. Can you just remind us what kind of exposures you have to these verticals and do they present some sort of an incremental headwind over the course of the coming quarters?","Keith Nosbusch","No. We don\u2019t have much exposure to the consumer electronics space. That is not one of the key areas. We do a little bit in the semiconductor industry that feeds the market, but those markets are much larger than just one dimension. So we don\u2019t see that as any change or any impact to our current business or our outlook for the rest of the year.","John Inch","Keith, 3M called out improvement in Europe yesterday. I realize you don\u2019t have a large presence there, but you guys have been gaining ground in recent years. Are you seeing similar sort of trend as the quarter progressed and based on what you\u2019re seeing in April.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. I think that\u2019s why we said we had \u2013 we built backlog last quarter and we expect growth for the full year, the remainder of the year. And we had a very good first quarter in Europe. So would say that we are seeing improvement there and it\u2019s been driven from both emerging Europe and then specific countries in mature Western Europe, particularly now that the south has come back a little better, strengthen in Italy, particularly in some of the home and personal care OEM segment. France has turned positive as well as Spain. So we do see that improvement, but it is also modest growth at this point.","John Inch","Okay. And then maybe just one for Ted. If I remember how you kind of laid out \u2013 how Rockwell has laid out its framework of expectation for 2016. Ted, you have the option of doing $10 million of extra restructuring. I think you said $10 million was a placeholder; you\u2019re doing $20 million. You have this option of doing $10 million depending on the cadence of economy. Could you just remind us about those numbers, right, and what\u2019s now baked into your thinking and the numbers going forward?","Ted Crandall","Yeah. You do have the numbers right. What we said, and I think this was back in November, is in a typical year we generally spend about $10 million on restructuring and we believe we will spend that this year. And I would say, through the first half, we\u2019re on pace to do that. And we said we had an additional provision for an extra $10 million if we saw conditions deteriorating to an extent that we believe required some further restructuring actions. So that remains the case.","John Inch","In other words \u2013 you\u2019re right. But we\u2019re already in the third quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re not really planning to spend it.","Ted Crandall","Well, we\u2019ll see. If you remember correctly, looking back, oftentimes, we\u2019ve taken some larger charges at the end of the year if we thought that was necessary to set us up for the expectations for the coming year. There\u2019s no way to predict at this point whether that would be the case. But if it is, we\u2019ve got the provision.","John Inch","Okay, I got it. Thanks very much.","Keith Nosbusch","You\u2019re welcome, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve, your line is open. You can ask your question.","Steve Tusa","Hey, great. Hey, everyone. Sorry for the delay there. Good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Keith, congratulations on the announcement. It\u2019s been a heck of a run and one of the best we\u2019ve seen in our group over the last 15 years. Through all the downturns and everything, you did a fantastic job and deserve all the kudos, so congratulations.","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we have a great team, but I appreciate the kind words.","Steve Tusa","Could you just talk about what you are seeing out there in auto? Broadly, what your expectations are for the rest of the year there? And just remind us, I think you said it was kind of low-single-digit in the quarter?","Keith Nosbusch","I don\u2019t think we said that in the quarter, but we do expect auto to grow in the second half of the year. Consumer and auto would be the two areas that we anticipate the above-the-company average and positive growth. And the specific question on auto for the quarter was that it was up 3% and I don\u2019t think I said that. But that was the number. So it was one of the offsets to some of our heavy industry declines, if you will.","What we\u2019re seeing in auto is continued high levels of investment. There is a lot of platform investment that is going on. We also see continued investment in Mexico by many of the US and European and Asian auto producers. We are seeing continued strength in China in the core automotive companies that we deal with. There\u2019s still many fringe companies that are struggling. Western Europe still is very slow, not a lot of growth there. And Brazil, given the recession, it has been a difficult market and we\u2019re seeing declines and projects being put on hold in Brazil.","I think the other piece to the question is probably \u2013 you were thinking is \u2013 powertrain. We continue to see improvements in powertrain. We are winning more projects. We have increased commitments in powertrain over the last 12 to 18 months and we still see that as a good opportunity for us going forward. And that\u2019s an area that we believe there will be ongoing investments and a place where we\u2019ll be able to grow share. So that\u2019s pretty much the color around auto.","Steve Tusa","And then just to follow-up, anything you\u2019re seeing competitively out there from a pricing perspective?","And then one just quick follow-up on that, Pentair talked about some of the beverage companies merging and they\u2019re kind of delaying projects. Are you seeing anything like that? Your food and bev business has been pretty good. So those will be the other two. Thanks a lot.","Keith Nosbusch","Okay. Well, let me answer the last one first. We\u2019re not seeing any impact in the beverage industry with the consolidations that are going on. We continue to have projects, particularly with some of the key brewing companies and have had some recent wins there. So we\u2019re, obviously, watching that. But many times we\u2019re a supplier to both sides of that activity. So we tend to be able to work that in the interim as opposed to when we\u2019re not on one side or the other and they\u2019re going to make some other decision. So that\u2019s the characterization there.","With respect to China\u2026","Steve Tusa","Not price. Price and kind of competitive behavior out there.","Keith Nosbusch","China is what I was going to say about price.","Steve Tusa","Well, got it.","Keith Nosbusch","But thank you for throwing that in. Price, I would say, it continues to be a topic in our conversations with customers. We haven\u2019t seen a significant impact, other than China has become even more aggressive in pricing than we had seen previously. We are seeing that in some of the infrastructure projects and some of the SOEs that operate in some of the major industries. And we still expect pricing to be less than a point globally for us this year, probably a little lower than last year.","Ted Crandall","But, Steve, I would say, our price realization in Q2 was very similar to price realization in Q1.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And still flat for the year-ish?","Ted Crandall","I think, suspect for the full year, we\u2019re going to be less than a point.","Steve Tusa","Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Congrats again, Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning and I want to echo the congratulations to Blake. And, Keith, quite a career. Congratulations. ","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Nigel Coe","Okay. So just on the mix in A&S, and you called out controller and software. And I\u2019m a little bit surprised because I think my understanding is that food and beverage and auto are very rich for controllers and software. I understand that process might be the reason for the software mix. Maybe just add some color there and why expect that to remain weak going through the back half of the year.","Ted Crandall","So I think, in the past, generally, when we talked about mix, it\u2019s been about product businesses versus solutions and services. But within the Architecture & Software segment, our controller and software businesses have a pretty balanced exposure across heavy industry, auto and consumer that is pretty similar to the overall company average in terms of exposure. The balance of the Architecture & Software segment, and particularly our motion control, sensing and safety businesses, are much more auto and consumer-centric. So with the significant decline we\u2019re seeing in heavy industry and with our process business down 18% year-over-year in Q2 and with auto and consumer showing modest growth, the bigger declines in the segment are coming in the controller and software businesses. So that is principally what\u2019s causing that mix issue. And I would say, in that regard, look, there\u2019s always going to be some normal variability in mix on a quarterly basis.","Nigel Coe","Of course. [indiscernible]. And then, maybe Ted as well, the way the quarter panned out, we\u2019ve seen a lot of commentary in past quarters, not necessarily from Rockwell, but from other companies, about stable trends, but then a weakening in the last month, did you see any variability through the quarter? So maybe just add some color in terms of what you\u2019re seeing as we go into April.","Ted Crandall","Yeah, I would say, it\u2019s pretty typical for us for sales to build as we move through the quarter and that\u2019s what we saw in Q2. So we didn\u2019t see any weakening in March.","Nigel Coe","Okay, so normal seasonality basically.","Ted Crandall","Yeah.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes.","Nigel Coe","Yep. Okay, great. Thanks, Ted.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning. Sorry if you covered this, just jumped on late. But how do you see people behaving on price, particularly kind of in the oil patch? Is there any discernible negative trend that\u2019s developed there?","Ted Crandall","So, Jeff, we had a previous question on this that Keith answered. Our price realization through the first half has been pretty much as we expected. We haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pricing dynamics as a consequence of currency. And I would say up to this point, we haven\u2019t seen any significant change in pricing levels in oil and gas compared to where we were last year.","Jeff Sprague","Right, thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","You\u2019re welcome, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Congratulations, Keith. Question for me is, you mentioned in the release, you see growth opportunities for the balance of the year. Could you please give us your thoughts on where you see those pockets of strength, whether in terms of verticals and geographies, and if any of your geographical revenue expectations have changed since the last call?","Ted Crandall","I think the easiest way to think about this might be, we expect some sequential growth in the second half of the year that\u2019s reasonably in line with normal seasonal patterns for us.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay.","Keith Nosbusch","Basically, that means we end up having a stronger Q4 as a normal seasonal pattern. With respect to where we\u2019re expecting this, we expect that the consumer and auto industries will be the best growth areas for us and that heavy industries, in particular oil and gas and mining, will be the weakest areas and that\u2019s the way we would characterize it. And I would say not a meaningful difference from what we have been seeing up to this point in time for the year. So that part has stayed pretty consistent, but, yes, we are expecting some sequential growth, modest sequential growth in the second half.","Deepa Raghavan","As a follow-up, process around the world, is that getting incrementally worse, better or the same as you would have expected? And just curious, what should happen for us to start to see growth in Logix especially? Is that \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 what drivers are material for it? Is it profitable at \u2013 oil prices seems to have stabilized. So is there a particular oil price level that you should be looking for or any other drivers that would help see an inflection in Logix?","Keith Nosbusch","First off, from the process standpoint, process was a little worse than we expected in the quarter. Oil and gas was what we expected, but the other heavy industries, particularly mining and metals, was a little worse and that\u2019s what triggered the decline.","We also believe that \u2013 your comment about Logix, two points to make. We do expect Logix to be a little bit below the A&S average, as Ted outlined earlier. Why that shift is occurring, it\u2019s really because of the end markets performance, with the other areas within the A&S segment. I would say the opportunities to continue to see growth will be the expansion of our footprint in the OEM sector, mainly because of some of the new introductions of CompactLogix and the capabilities of integrated motion and safety in that platform. We believe that will allow us to create more opportunities in that space. And the other would be heavy industry. As the process starts coming back, we expect to see a better impact in the performance of our ControlLogix business in that sector.","And then, as we continue to build out the high-performance architecture and The Connected Enterprise, we see that as great growth opportunities for our hardware platforms, of which Logix would be front and center there. ","Deepa Raghavan","Okay, thanks. So are you expecting process to improve in 2017? Is that \u2013 obviously, you have easy comps going into 2017, but is there any other expectation behind that?","Keith Nosbusch","For 2017, that\u2019s a little early for us to be going there with all of you knowing the visibility we have. So we\u2019ll give our 2017 guidance in the November call, but we do expect that process in fiscal year 2016 will be down in the mid-teens. So certainly not a recovery expected in this fiscal year.","Deepa Raghavan","Thank you very much.","Keith Nosbusch","Welcome. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys. ","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","Congrats, Keith. I remember, you took over, I think the stock was about $20. And I wasn\u2019t smart enough to recommend it at the time, but, boy, it was a heck of a run that you had, I think. Blake, the stock would have to get to about $700 by the time you retire to equal your predecessor\u2019s impact on the market. Good luck with that.","Blake Moret","[indiscernible].","Scott Davis","No pressure at all. Good luck. Anyways, it\u2019s been a great run, so congrats and good luck in your retirement.","Guys, I want to talk a little bit about long order books. I know it\u2019s hard and some of the other questions have touched on this bit. But if you think about your front log or your inquiries out, call it, 12-plus months on bigger projects where guys bring you in early, have you been \u2013 have you seen any inflection there at all, any encouragement at all, any folks that are now taking a look at the little pickup in commodity prices we\u2019ve had and start to have a little bit more confidence to do stuff.","Keith Nosbusch","No, I would say, at this point, our front log has remained relatively flat. What we are seeing is a few more quotation activity in some of those industries. And generally, at this point, we would attribute that to, \u2018they have a little more time now,\u2019 and so they\u2019re starting to look at future potential projects and we\u2019re involved in that either directly with the end user or sometimes with a system integrator or EPC. So we are seeing more of that activity, but we aren\u2019t seeing the opportunities to convert into our front log at this point in time as of yet.","Scott Davis","Okay. And just as a follow-on, I don\u2019t hear you guys talk much about distributor inventories. Certainly, I would imagine, just given the size of some of your distributors, do you see some trends of stock restock that may mirror customer confidence and such? But have you seen anything \u2013 and I don\u2019t know what your channel view is with all your distros, but have you seen any patterns of inventory changes even in the last four or five months?","Ted Crandall","So, Scott, we get point-of-sale data from most of our distributors. And for a very large portion of our distributors, we manage their inventory of our products electronically and do electronic replenishment. So we have pretty good visibility, maybe very good visibility of what\u2019s in the channel, particularly in a market like North America. I would say, distributor inventories have been relatively stable. They have come down over the last 18 months, consistent with the drop in the volumes, but not in excess of that, and we haven\u2019t seen any evidence of kind of overstocking.","Scott Davis","Okay. Keith, I was just \u2013 before I pass it on, I wanted to share a story. I remember your first presentation to the Street back many years ago. You hadn\u2019t traded in your engineering outfit for your CEO outfit yet and you showed up with pants that were about 3 inches too short. And I remember the guys looking at each other and saying, \u2018God, we have to take up a collection and buy this guy some new suits.\u2019 Looks can be deceiving. At first, we all thought you might have been a little bit of a nerd, but it was a great run. So congrats and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Scott. And I\u2019ll take that suit anytime you\u2019ve got it. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. ","Richard Eastman","Yes, good morning. And Keith and Blake, congrats. ","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Rich. Good morning.","Richard Eastman","Just a question, Keith, Latin America had another kind of standout quarter, up almost 13% in local currency. And I think you explained a lot of that by the transition by the major global auto putting production in Mexico and that benefit. But one of the things that did come up during the quarter in February, I believe, Pemex basically was the last to blink on their capital spend plan, but kind of quite dramatically. So when you look to the balance of your fiscal year, is that in your plan and does that function as an offset to your growth in Latin America in the second half and into next year?","Keith Nosbusch","A couple of things. One, I spoke about Mexico with respect to the auto question. Our growth in Mexico is very broad-based. It includes, quite candidly, heavy industries. We are growing in oil and gas. And matter of fact, the only place we have a positive growth in oil and gas is Mexico. We have mining activities there. Auto is one, but we also \u2013 there is tire investments going there, supporting auto, wastewater, consumer. It\u2019s a very broad, diverse economy. So I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that it was automotive driven. And we\u2019ve had phenomenal growth the last couple of quarters and the last couple of years throughout Latin America. And Mexico now has taken over the lead there with the issues in Brazil. But we see a continued growth opportunity. It\u2019s going to be hard to match the first two quarters in the remainder of the year. But we still believe that Latin America will be our highest growth region over the next two quarters. So we continue to create opportunities there.","We are very hopeful that with Argentina and the change that is going on there that we\u2019ll see more positive \u2013 matter of fact, that is one of the areas where we\u2019re seeing more interest in companies thinking about making investments than 6 to 12 months ago. We\u2019re also seeing in the Andean region the need to continue to spend some money on OpEx and small productivity projects in the mining industries, obviously, because of the share prices. Because of the commodity prices there, it\u2019s important that they continue to drive costs out. So I would say the greatest challenge remains Venezuela and Brazil and those will be the greatest challenges in Latin America.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just one last follow-up question. When I look at maybe the incremental weakness in the metals and mining piece of process and then also the book-to-bill at less than 1 in the solutions business, usually, you build backlog in Q2 for the second half, but is that \u2013 when you take those two things into consideration, the incremental weakness in those two areas, are we best of shading the minus 4.5% core growth because there was no change here to your guidance essentially on core growth?","Ted Crandall","So our outlook by vertical is at best a little bit fuzzy when we\u2019re going out nine or even six months. I think now is \u2013 updating our guidance from January, we think mining and metals are going to be a little bit weaker than we expected back in January. As it relates to oil and gas, we were thinking down 20 in January. We still think that\u2019s down 20 for the full year. But we now expect consumer-related industries to be a little bit better. So that\u2019s why we\u2019ve maintained the overall organic growth rate for the year.","Richard Eastman","Okay, that\u2019s fine.","Ted Crandall","And, Rick, as it relates to the 0.98, that\u2019s below what we thought it would be in the quarter, but we were thinking of a number more like 1.03, 1.04, so it wasn\u2019t too dramatically lower. ","Richard Eastman","Yes, okay. And then, obviously, we\u2019d pick up $60 million from currency translation [indiscernible], okay. Okay, very good. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good morning, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Congrats, Keith and Blake. I echo everything else that was said. I\u2019ll spare you the gushing, but congratulations. Hey, in terms of the adoption of Connected Enterprise you were talking about, what are customers willing to spend on in this kind of a macro environment right now? Are you seeing them do sort of broad-based adoption or very sort of small kind of \u2013 putting their toes in the water on this stuff? Give a little sense of what people are willing to do and is that willingness improving at all?","Keith Nosbusch","It kind of has a broad spectrum. It\u2019s not one approach that every customer is taking. But we now have more than ten pilots and rollouts that are going on at key customers in multiple industries. We are doing it in mining and metals and automotive and tire, in food, home and personal care, diversified industrials, consumer, multi-industry companies, and quite candidly, in our own Rockwell Automation journey on The Connected Enterprise.","So I would say, what we\u2019re seeing customers doing, are starting to implement their journey of digitizing their enterprise. And they are willing to spend at this point on learning and creating value and demonstrating that value in a portion of their business. We have only one or two major, I\u2019ll say, companies or multi-plant, multi-geography rollouts that are going on. But the majority of it is testing of the concepts, of the integration of IT and OT, that convergence, and how they can also be thinking about this from reducing \u2013 improving their asset utilization on the plant floor and they\u2019re willing to spend money in that. And they\u2019re also trying to think about how does this extend more broadly into their entire supply chain. And so, that is what we\u2019re seeing at this point in time. And with the introduction of the high-performance architecture and the ability to do real-time integrated control and information, that is the foundation of where they are starting to do this.","And it\u2019s about conversations and dialogues across multi disciplines in their organization. So our meetings now are with the IT organizations, the senior leadership of companies as they\u2019re trying to understand what their broader strategy should be and, of course, the automation teams where we\u2019re traditionally focused. So it\u2019s working with different parts of the organization, it\u2019s delivering on business outcomes as opposed to simply the productivity from automation and that\u2019s a characterization of where we\u2019re at at this point in time. And it\u2019s an area that we think will continue to develop over the next couple of years and we\u2019ll see the pace of it increase down the road.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","And are any of these big enough or far enough along to sort of qualify as sort of signature adoptions that you can use, kind of customer testimonials as ways to drive adoption in other customers or are these all like \u2013 some of them smaller projects. Is there enough where you\u2019re going to be able to say, \u2018hey, look at what customer X did and look at what we\u2019re able to do for their enterprise,\u2019 and use this kind of a marketing of Connected Enterprise.","Keith Nosbusch","Well, that\u2019s, obviously, the goal, but we don\u2019t have that opportunity now. If you remember, at the investor meeting, our annual meeting, at Automation Fair, the best example of that is the Rockwell Automation journey story where we are able to quantify the benefits and we get a customer testimonial called us.","But the reality is, this is still early. And in many cases, the customers are not anxious to demonstrate publicly the value that it has driven for them. But that is certainly our goal as we go forward and we think we\u2019ll have some very significant examples and demonstrated outcomes that will be able to validate for other industries and other customers the benefits. And, obviously, that\u2019s the goal. You hit it on the head. It\u2019s about how can you take what we\u2019re doing and translate it to the marketing front-end. And that\u2019s why I mentioned the broad list of customers that we\u2019re currently working with by industry because many of these are lighthouse accounts, lighthouse customers that are viewed as market leaders. And, therefore, when we can become more public with this, it will help us demonstrate to the rest of the industry and the rest of the customer base that there is value here.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Operator, we will take one more question. After that, Keith will have some closing comments before we will end the call. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. ","Steve Winoker","Thanks. And good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Keith, obviously, congratulations. Hard to top Scott\u2019s stories back to 1974 to Alan Bradley. So, anyway, that\u2019s awesome for you.","One question on that, though, the split of the Chairman versus CEO role, to what extent is this just a sort of convenient timing transition versus a philosophical change in governance?","Keith Nosbusch","This is timing for this time. I think our governance process is very clearly articulated here, in that the Board from time to time evaluates the combination or separate roles and they make that decision based upon the circumstances at the time. So this is consistent with our governance processes and generally consistent with how Rockwell Automation and Rockwell have done this in previous transitions. So nothing more to read into it.","Steve Winoker","Okay, great. And then, Ted, on A&S, you talked about it a little bit in terms of the mix impact and I assume CompactLogix, motion control, etc., but can you maybe quantify or give us a little sense for that increased spending relative to mix and currency and volume impact and where the spending was directed and continuation of it, etc.?","Ted Crandall","Yeah. So all four of the major items I mentioned \u2013 the volume, the mix, the currency impact, the spend \u2013 all of those on a year-over-year basis were a little over a point. On the spend, our spending in Architecture & Software is up about 4% year-over-year in the quarter. Our comparisons will get easier in the second half on spend, so spending will not be up by that same percentage in the second half, but it\u2019s up about 4% in the quarter. And again, that reflects kind of primarily continued investment in product development.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And I assume Connected Enterprise type items or is it other?","Ted Crandall","That\u2019s definitely part of it.","Steve Winoker","Yeah. Okay, thanks very much. That\u2019s all. See you soon.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Ted Crandall","Before Keith starts his closing comments, I just had two quick items for you. One, something that did not come up in the Q&A was our full-year outlook for China, and that often comes up on the later calls, so I wanted to let you know that we still expect China for the full year to be down high-single-digits to maybe 10%.","The other is, I got a note from a Rockwell colleague that suggested in my comments that I misstated the full year \u2013 the expected full-year outstanding share count. So if that is the case, I apologize. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 131 million for the full year.","Thank you. And Keith?","Keith Nosbusch","Okay. So with that last comment, let me end the call on a personal note. As you know, we have great employees, great customers and great partners. That is what makes Rockwell Automation a special company.","It has been an honor and a privilege to have been CEO for the past 12-plus years. I have met and interacted with many of you over that time and I\u2019ve always appreciated your keen interest in our company. Your coverage, questions and comments have been insightful and have helped us better understand our investors\u2019 perspectives. ","I\u2019d also like to think that we did our part to earn your confidence and trust and your investments. We have great shareowners who understand our business model and our focus on innovation, sustainable competitive differentiation, and long-term value creation. And for that, I have all of you to thank.","Over the next two months, I look forward to meeting with you at the remaining investor events. It\u2019s been a great run and we will have an even better future and Blake is the right person to lead that future. Thank you.","Patrick Goris","That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect at this time and have a wonderful day.",""],"18913":["Rockwell Automation, Inc.

Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations","Good morning and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 60 days.","Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. As you probably all know by now, I succeeded Keith Nosbusch as President and CEO earlier this month while Keith remains Chairman of our Board. I am honored beyond words and humbled to lead this great company. I thank the board for the opportunity.","As several of you mentioned on the call last quarter, Keith had a tremendous run as CEO. He transformed Rockwell Automation into a technology company based on intellectual capital, expanded our served markets and increased market share by enhancing the value we provide to our customers. As a result, Keith has generated exceptional financial returns for shareowners during his tenure.","On a personal note, I'd like to thank Keith for demonstrating how to win the right way, by focusing on long-term customer value and rock-solid integrity. So, certainly big shoes to fill, but I'm very confident that with our dedicated employees, experienced management team and best-in-class partners we can continue to build on our track record of differentiation, above-market revenue growth and superior financial returns.","With that, I'll start with some key points for the quarter. so, please turn to page three in the slide deck. The quarter was generally in line with our expectations. Year-over-year organic sales were down about a point more than we expected and margins were somewhat better. As we projected, sales in our product businesses picked compared to the prior quarter. Orders in our solutions and services businesses improved sequentially but solutions and services orders and sales came in below expectations, particularly in the U.S. and Canada.","Globally the vertical picture is pretty much the same as in prior quarters. Heavy industry end markets remain challenging, with oil and gas, and mining the weakest verticals. Oil and gas was down over 30% in the quarter, more than we expected. Consumer and auto both continued to grow. Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada were down 8%. Heavy industries, including oil and gas, accounted for almost all of the year-over-year decline. In the U.S., we experienced some delays in larger projects generally but particularly in heavy industry end markets affecting our solutions and services businesses.","In China, conditions remained stable and we saw another quarter of sequential revenue growth as consumer and auto continued to outperform heavy industries. As expected, sales were down mid-teens in the quarter. I'm encouraged, however, that orders in China were up year-over-year.","EMEA had an excellent quarter with over 5% organic sales growth. I'm particularly pleased with our continued progress with machine builders in this region. Home and personal care, and food and beverage were the strongest verticals in this region.","In Latin America, sales were up 8% led by Mexico where strength remains broad based across most verticals.","Let me add a few comments about the quarter. Our Process Business was flat compared to the prior quarter and down 20% year-over-year. Logix was down 3% compared to last year but grew 4% sequentially. And I'm pleased that as expected, Architecture & Software margins improved and were up 300 basis points sequentially. This contributed to our strong segment margin performance in the quarter of over 21%. Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks.","Let's move on to our outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect continued improvement in our product sales but the weaker third quarter solutions and services orders and sales performance has caused us to reduce our sales outlook for the fourth quarter. We still believe we will see modest sequential sales improvement in the second half of the fiscal year, but not as much as we anticipated in April.","Globally, we expect heavy industries to remain weak and see a continued positive outlook for the consumer and automotive verticals. Taking all these factors into consideration, we are lowering our full year fiscal 2016 organic sales guidance to down about 4% at the midpoint, a point lower than our April guidance and are revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.80 to $6.00. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. Given the recent leadership transition, I recognize that many of you have questions about my vision for Rockwell Automation and what changes you can expect. I'll have the opportunity to share my thoughts with you in more detail at our Annual Investor Day at Automation Fair in November this year, but here are some initial points.","Rockwell Automation will continue to focus all of our passion and knowledge on making our customers more productive. We'll do that by building on the strong foundation Keith built and maximizing customer value by understanding our customers' best opportunities for productivity, combining a differentiated technology and domain expertise to deliver positive business outcomes for our customers and continually simplifying their experience. Understanding fosters loyalty. Combining technology and expertise increases customer share, preserves margins and reduces cyclicality. Simplification drives productivity for our customers and for us. Above-market growth will come from share gains, new value from the Connected Enterprise and acquisitions used as catalysts to accelerate our strategy.","We are very well positioned to bring the Connected Enterprise to life for our customers, given our technology, domain expertise, partners and market access. We are implementing a growing number of pilots to quantify this new value and I am pleased with the progress and diversity of these customer engagements.","Expansion of these pilots to multiple locations may take some time to play out and the pace will vary from vertical to vertical, customer to customer. However, we continue to earn the position of trusted partner at new customers every day as a single integrated business focused exclusively on making them more competitive.","Finally, I'd like to thank our employees and partners for their continued dedication in serving our customers.","With that, Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Blake, and good morning, everybody. I'll start on page four, third quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.474 billion, 6.4% lower than Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 4.8% and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.8%. As Blake said, the organic sales decline was about 1 point worse than we expected and the shortfall was primarily in our solutions and services businesses in the U.S. and Canada. Currency was in line with our expectations.","Segment operating margin was 21.1% in the third quarter, down 70 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily related to the lower sales and unfavorable currency impact, partly offset by lower incentive compensation cost. Operating margin improved sequentially by 1.8 points.","General corporate net was approximately $17 million in the quarter compared to $22 million in Q3 last year. Adjusted earnings per share was $1.55, down $0.04 or 3% compared to third quarter of last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 25.1% compared to 27.9% in Q3 last year. We recognized a favorable discrete tax item in the current quarter and we're also benefiting this year from the R&D tax credit.","Free cash flow for Q3 was $250 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%. A couple of items not shown here, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.8 million, down about 3.5% compared to last year. Also, during the third quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of about $122 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of $370 million.","In November, we talked about a full year repurchase target of $500 million. We're running very close to that pace through June. At the end of the quarter, there was $1.075 billion remaining under the previous share repurchase authorization.","The next slide presents the sales and operating margin performance of our Architecture & Software segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date. I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results.","On the left side of this chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $666 million in Q3, down 2.5% compared to Q3 last year. Organic sales declined 1.3%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 1.6%. Sequential organic growth was about 4.5%.","Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 27.6%, down 160 basis points compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to lower sales and unfavorable mix and currency impacts, offset in part by lower incentive compensation costs. Operating margin improved sequentially by 300 basis points.","Turning to page six, this is the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the third quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $808 million, down 9.4% year-over-year on a reported basis with organic sales down 7.5%. Currency translation reduced sales by 1.9%. Sequentially, organic sales for Control Products & Solutions declined by 1.5%.","On a year-over-year basis, organic sales for the product businesses in the segment declined about 4.5%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 10%. Decline in the solutions and services portion of this business was about $15 million larger than we expected and this was primarily in heavy industry verticals in the U.S. and Canada.","The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.04. Particularly in the U.S., we saw a larger amount of project delays in our solutions and services businesses in Q3 and we expect this trend in delays to continue into Q4. Consequently, we've reduced our previous projections for sales in these businesses for the fourth quarter.","CP&S operating margin was 15.7%, down 40 basis points from 16.1% in Q3 last year. We consider that to be good margin performance on a significant top line reduction. The impact of lower sales was partly offset by productivity and lower incentive compensation costs.","Moving to the next slide. Page seven provides the geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter, and the nine months through June. As you can see on the slide, the organic sales decline in the quarter was driven by the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific with healthy organic growth in EMEA and Latin America. Blake already provided some regional colors so I'll just add a couple of notes.","We experienced a year-over-year decline of 1% in total Emerging Market organic sales with the decline in China more than offsetting growth in the balance of the emerging countries. Blake mentioned the weakness in the heavy industry including oil and gas being down over 30% year-over-year in Q3. That was a larger decline than we expected. Previously, we expected oil and gas to be down about 20% for the full year. We now expect a decline of about 25%.","Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year 2016 guidance. So, as Blake said, we are revising full year guidance and narrowing the guidance range. Given the sales and order misses in our solutions and services businesses in Q3, and a related reduced outlook for Q4, we're reducing the guidance midpoint for organic sales from a decline of minus 3% to minus 4%. You can think of the new guidance range as plus or minus about $50 million, so roughly minus 3% to minus 5% organically. We now expect currency to be a little more negative for the full year but still at about minus 3%.","We expect reported sales of approximately $5.85 billion at the midpoint. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a little lower than 20.5%, so no change from previous guidance despite the reduced top line. We now expect an Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for the full year of about 24.5%, about a 0.5 point lower than previous guidance, and primarily due to the favorable discrete item in Q3 that I mentioned earlier.","Taking into account lower organic sales, our operating margin expectation and a modestly lower tax rate, the new guidance range for Adjusted EPS is $5.80 to $6. That puts us $0.05 lower than previous guidance at the midpoint. As usual, there are a lot of moving parts. But basically, the earnings contribution that we lost due to lower solutions and services organic sales we mostly offset with somewhat lower spending and a lower tax rate.","We continue to expect about 100% conversion of Adjusted Income to free cash flow. There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $131 million for the full year. And finally, our guidance continues to include a provision for potential restructuring charges of about $10 million in the fourth quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick for the Q&A.","Patrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you for that. And, operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","One of the things \u2013 and welcome, Blake, to your first solo call.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You guys have done a pretty good job in this down cycle we're experiencing right now holding margins, keeping the wheels on and such. And when you think about your change in guidance kept margins flat versus prior guidance. How much of that is this lowered compensation dynamic? And how sustainable is that? When you think about \u2013 Blake, when you think about going into next year, I mean, you start thinking about compounding years of lower compensation. At some point I would imagine it's \u2013 you risk losing some people. So how do you think about that dynamic?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So, Scott, to your first question, in terms of the April guidance to July guidance, there's no difference in the savings from lower incentive compensation. It's the same in both numbers. But to your question about sustainability. I mean, you're correct and we've been saying all year that when our sales and earnings start to improve once again, we will have to restore the incentive compensation to more normal levels. And so at some point we're going to have a headwind in our margins related to that.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. And then as a quick follow-on, when you think about large project delays, are they being delayed because of macro conditions? Are they being delayed because of shortage of labor? I mean what is the primary cause?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Typically, it's because the users don't need the additional capacity. So I don't think the shortage of labor is as big an issue as the users going slower on planned upgrades or capacity expansions.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's what I thought. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Morning.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning. Oil and gas, can we talk about that for a second? Down over 30%. You got companies like Halliburton and Dover that perpetually called the bottom and say, things are going to get better. And then ITW basically said, no, we wouldn't call the bottom. I understand you're not an oil and gas company, but based on your front log and the impacts, I mean where \u2013 is this thing going to sort of sequentially continue to kind of dribble down here and get worse? Or what do you think on that front? And what's maybe baked into your guidance for the fourth quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Hey. So, John, so this is Ted. We were a little bit surprised by the Q3 results. We did not expect to see kind of a sequential decline in the oil and gas business. It was largely driven by Latin America, which was also a surprise to us, and it was related to some project push outs in the quarter because it was project specific it's a little bit hard to call whether this is a trend or whether it's just something unique to this quarter. I don't think we're comfortable calling a bottom in oil and gas but we're not expecting further sequential decline in Q4.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Ted, Latin America, by that you mean PEMEX and in that context you don't have to be an oil forecaster. You could probably look at PEMEX or whatever customer it is and try and ring fence the impact. I mean is \u2013 anything you can say on that front? Are we talking Mexico? And just my other comment, is this a customer-related issue or do you think it's just more broad?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The only thing I would say is this was broader than PEMEX.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We saw this across oil, across Latin America. And so PEMEX was part of it but not the largest part of it.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Well maybe it's Zika-related. Can I ask you about the down 20% Process? Honeywell didn't put up results like that. I realize you're not Honeywell, but maybe this is a dovetail question for Blake. Process has been one of Keith's signature sort of focal points. And I understand markets are weak. But why is Process down 20%? Was there any kind of incremental color you can provide? And I'd be curious if, Blake, in your own thoughts towards how you're going to prioritize Process or how you're thinking about it in the context of strategic opportunities?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thanks, John. First of all, Process remains at the top of the list in terms of our growth opportunities. It's the large part of our served market and we continue to invest in technology and domain expertise and in market access to take share in Process.","One of the factors I think contributing to our reductions in Process is we don't have the same historical installed base to be able to mine recurring revenue in the form of service contracts from those Process Systems that may have been installed 20 years or 30 years ago. So, that's one of the primary factors that we don't see the hedge, if you will, against the volatility in the project-based business.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","John, I think the other \u2013 I'm not an expert on Honeywell, but I think Honeywell's exposure in oil and gas is much more downstream oriented than ours. And I think that's another factor in the performance.","And then the biggest thing for us in Process is simply that a lot of our Process Business is solutions-related. Our solutions exposure is much more heavy-industry related. And with oil and gas down significantly and mining down significantly, it's hard for us to post better numbers in Process.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. No, Honeywell's definitely downstream for sure. So that \u2013 so just a last one. So just the Process then, is this dovetailing? I realize there's a lot of Venn diagram overlaps in Rockwell's results. Is this dovetailing with the Canada, U.S. kind of being a little worse? So what you're saying is your Process Business hasn't been there 30 years? So there's a lot more new project reliance. So if there's some heavy industry push to the right, which I'm assuming encompasses oil and gas, is this also explaining Process? Like is this all part of the same thing, if you will?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. That's right.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. And, Blake, congratulations on the job.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So just to follow on to Scott's question. I think there's going to be a lot of questions on the impact of the compensation tailwinds. And I know that, Ted, you mentioned it's the same as the April quarter sorry, the Q2 fiscal. Maybe could you just maybe try and help us quantify what that tail could be as we think about next year's numbers?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, so I can't. I don't think I want to try to do 2017 guidance, especially on a specific number like incentive comp. But I can quantify it for this year. We have consistently said that the year-over-year savings that we got from incentive comp this year was tens of millions of dollars, but less than $50 million.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And that's obviously for the fiscal year rather than the quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That was for the full fiscal year 2016.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then that range is still valid -- okay, that's very helpful. Thanks. Thanks, Ted. And then, I guess just thinking about the way that the quarter developed. It's obviously -- your guidance for 4Q is very similar to 3Q so it doesn't feel like there's a whole lot just changing. But there's obviously a big debate about auto and actually, Mexico as well. I mean, Mexican IP is close to negative, if it's not already there. Mexico has been a bright spot. So, first of all I guess, are you seeing any signs of tired legs on the auto cycle and some of the CapEx investments? And secondly, any signs of weakening in Mexico, just given the quite weak data that we see on the macro front?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, so on auto, we saw growth in auto in Q3 kind of as we expected. And we're expecting Q4 to be a good quarter. In Mexico, Mexico was not quite as good as we were thinking it could be in Q3, primarily around heavy industry. And I think our expectations for Mexico in Q4 are now a little lower than they were a quarter ago.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. No surprise there. Thanks, Ted.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks a lot. Good morning. Congratulations, Blake, best of luck.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","The Latin America oil and gas weakness, I assume that \u2013 is a lot of that offshore-related? Or is there a mix there?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's a mix. When we talk specifically about PEMEX, that's going to be inclusive of both offshore rigs as well as onshore production. And then when we look at Brazil, again, a mix that would be a little bit heavier on the offshore side. But, of course, Brazil is very weak as they remain in a recession?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I think a lot of these guys asked a lot of good questions so far so I'll take the high level one. What are you seeing out there? How do you think this economy is trending over the next 12 months? I know we've got these kind of project delays. Are these project delays \u2013 do they represent pent-up demand or because of this capacity situation we're in, what do you kind of see from just a broad ISM or broad CapEx perspective out there from an appetite perspective as you talk to customers about the pipeline of activity? What's your sense of \u2013 how do you characterize these environments for the next 12 months to 18 months?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, speaking specifically of the U.S., we'd characterize the U.S. market as stable. We are seeing some growth in consumer but continued weakness in heavy industry, including oil and gas.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Steve, I think more than anything else this is just, what we're seeing is constrained capital spending in heavy industry.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And so is that phased? I mean, does anything else pick up \u2013 if those declines moderate, is there anything else you see there that kind of can accelerate going forward? Is there just kind of \u2013 oh man, I just wish we got a little catalyst, there's a big pipeline of opportunities. Or just kind of hand to mouth, more hand to mouth?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So if we look beyond oil and gas and we look for some of the pockets of relative strength in heavy industries, pulp and paper, we do see growth in pulp and paper. In water, wastewater we had a good Q3 and we expect continued growth there. Chemicals, the chemical industry continues to benefit from the lower cost feedstock from natural gas. And so we see strength in chemical as well.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. And welcome, Blake. I guess, my first question would be around the U.S. demand trends that you talked about. I think a lot of companies have seen pretty weak but steady demand in the last few months in the U.S. Clearly, things seem to be disappointing for you. So is that something that got worse as the quarter went on? Or was it something that was true pretty much of the whole last sort of three- or four-month period?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, Julian, there's some different questions there. The first thing I would say is from a quarterly progression point of view, this was a pretty typical quarter where we actually saw improvement as the quarter progressed.","In terms of overall U.S. market conditions, it's a little bit mixed right now. I mean, our product sales in the U.S. were up sequentially pretty much exactly as we expected, and I'd say we're seeing a positive demand trend on the product side. It was really the solutions and services businesses where we saw the unexpected decline and it appears to be very much related to heavy industry. As you know, we've got more exposure in solutions and services to heavy industry and a better exposure in product sales at consumer and automotive, and I think it's that dichotomy in the performance of those respective verticals that's causing that result.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you, and then just within the margins within CP&S, they've been extremely resilient in the last nine months. I was curious if you're seeing in your backlog in the context of the weak orders and book-to-bill, if you're seeing anything from mix or worse, pricing that suggests that those margins in CP&S come under a little bit more pressure in the next three months to six months?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, if anything in CP&S we're benefiting from a little bit of favorable mix because the product sales growth has been outpacing solutions and services sales growth. Specifically, as it relates to pricing, on the product side, we saw about the same level of pricing in Q3 as we have seen in the earlier quarters this year. On the solutions and services side, in a down market like this, things tend to get more competitive, but I wouldn't say we're expecting any significant impact on margins in Q4.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Please, go ahead.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Welcome, Blake.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rick.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just a quick couple of thoughts, if you will, on EMEA. I think the reference there on the growth rates of just under 6% was really around the more machine builders market. But could you maybe go one level deeper on the machine builders market and what is the exposure there? Is it on the consumer side? Is it exports? So just maybe a little better sense of what the customer base on the machine builder side looks like in EMEA and how sustainable that kind of mid-single digit growth rate might be here over the next couple quarters.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, Rick, you said it. It is centered on the consumer side and food and beverage. So a classic OEM success story for us in Europe would be a packaging machine builder who's benefiting, quite frankly, from some of our recent product releases in our core platforms. And as they try to be more competitive, as they go after the mid range type of machines, especially in emerging markets, we've given them some new functionality that's allowed them to better compete. And so we're seeing growth in that segment of the OEM market.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And just maybe as a follow-up question. I just want to follow-up on the CP&S business again. Looking at maybe the fourth quarter core guide, it does appear though as the CP&S business should seasonally show some fourth quarter strength over the third quarter. And is the backlog and your commentary around pricing and the solutions business, does the op profit in the fourth quarter respond to that higher volume sequentially?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, Rick, I think everything we have talked about around the weakness that we saw in solutions and services orders in Q3 and the delays that we think are going to carry over into Q4, the typical significant revenue uptick we get from Q3 to Q4 primarily related to our solutions and services businesses. We don't think we're going to see that this year, at least not to the same extent.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Correct.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And so that is going to have an impact on operating margin. We're not going to get that same volume leverage, operating margin impact that we normally have in Q4. The other two things are going on in Q4, in Q3 spending came a little bit lighter than we expected. And I think there's going to be some catch up of that in Q4. And then I mentioned in my comments, we've got about $10 million of potential restructuring charges sitting in Q4 as well.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And that is the $10 million of restructuring, presumably that's a pre-tax number. That's included in your guidance? Or excluded?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Included.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And that is a pre-tax number.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And so just to clarify though, the revenue in CP&S for the fourth quarter will be lower than it is \u2013 than it was in the third?","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No.","Theodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, we will not be lower. We just won't have the magnitude of increase we typically see.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Correct. I understand. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. And welcome, Blake.","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Blake. Can you fill out your thoughts on kind of the Connected Enterprise updates you gave in some of the pilots? You talked about the number increasing and just sort of the nature of the timing and how you see it developing?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Just to set the context, the Connected Enterprise really is at the heart of the company's overall strategy. And so while we sometimes focus on the new value that comes from the Connected Enterprise with the networks and networks services, security and information management software, it really begins with our core platforms. And so the functionality that I talked about for a machine builder, those same products include the functionality that enables that higher-level productivity.","So just let me give an example with that same packaging OEM. They're using our new products, some of our recent CompactLogix releases, Motion, PowerFlex drives to get more performance out of their machinery and more flexibility and to be able to perform safety functions more elegantly. When that equipment is shipped to, say, a food producer, we enable faster line integration with our software. We can provide network design services to remove bottlenecks and we can remotely monitor that line and a hundred other lines around the world to benchmark performance to maximize up time. So the data that can be turned into information to make better decisions already exists in our plan for drives and controllers. And we've been asked by users in a wide variety of industries to get involved with pilots to quantify that value. So they're starting small so that they can have a discreet opportunity to look at the benefits of this new functionality before they roll it out to multiple locations. And that's going to take a little while to play out, and each customer's going to move at their own pace. But we're very encouraged by the early progress.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then, Rockwell has always made great use of the partnership network, as well as alliances over the years. Is any of that changing? There's a lot of partnerships seeming to be formed out there, GE with Microsoft recently. And that's been one of your alliances for a long time as well. Does that change anything? Do you guys need to adapt at all in terms of your historical approach to partnerships and alliances? Or is it still the same approach?","Blake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Shannon. It's still the same approach. We don't anticipate any changes in our strategy, the closeness to Microsoft from the recent announcement because most of these partnerships are non-exclusive. And at the end of the day it's bringing positive outcomes to the user, combining the technology and the domain expertise that count. So that particular partnership is a lot around infrastructure and some of the specific cloud-level functionality.","What we talk about in terms of new value, importantly, is scalability, and so a lot of the benefit that we can bring to a user is going to happen without having to leave the four walls of a plant. But we continue to work closely with Microsoft and Cisco and AT&T and a host of other partners to be able to bring the functionality that, that customer needs to make them most productive.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Jeff.\n\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. I don't think we're looking at starvation of MRO and OpEx. And I think, Jeff, the health that we're seeing in product demand is indicative of some reasonable level of MRO spending ongoing. I mean, I think my comments about the vertical exposure on the product side was more related to projects.\n\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nWell, I'm not going to break out growth spending. I'll just talk about spending generally. Our sales are going to be down, if we're right about the guidance, by about 4% organically year-over-year. Spending I think is going to be close to flat year-over-year. So, on balance it's a little bit of a headwind to the margins. But when you look within spending I think what you would see is our R&D spending is actually up year-over-year a little bit in absolute dollars and up considerably as a percent of sales because of the sales decline and we've seen some reduction year-over-year in the SG&A areas.\n\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nJeff, acquisitions still remain an important part of our growth strategy. And I look at acquisitions as catalysts to identify strategic growth opportunities for the company. So we're not going to get into acquisitions that take us into lines of business that we don't understand but to speed up activities that we've already begun internally. I see it as an important part of our overall growth plan. We remain focused on organic growth first. But then acquisitions as catalysts are in the second position. We have a strong pipeline now. We're pursuing acquisitions now and we're not constrained by any small size limit. The ones we've done recently have happened to be on the smaller side. But we'll look at bigger ones too if they make sense and they fit that model.\nJeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nGood morning, guys. Blake, congratulations.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nSo, China down mid-teen in the quarter but orders up year-over-year. You mentioned consumer and auto still doing well there. I think your guidance before was for China to be down high-single digits to about 10% for the year. Is that still the case? And are you seeing any signs of tire and heavy industry at least bottoming, given some stability in China over the last couple quarters?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nSo your first question, I think China's going to be down about 10% year-over-year. I mean, that's our expectation given the Q3 performance and what we're looking at for Q4. I'd characterize China generally, including heavy industry, as stable. It doesn't seem to be getting a lot worse. But I would not say that we think we've turned the corner yet either.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nAnd, Andy, on the specific comment around tire. From a worldwide standpoint, there are a number of greenfield tire plants that are under construction or under design around the world. A lot of those are heading towards North America and Mexico. It's a bit of an issue of timing and which machine builders win the big portions of those facilities to determine where those will hit. We have a strong position in tire. That's going to be re-enforced with these new greenfields. But again, we're not exactly sure where all of those orders are going to be placed.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nOkay. Thanks for that. And I think I know the answer to this, but I'll ask it anyway. Have you seen any improvement at all in metals and mining at this point? Or at least signs of a bottom? It might be too early for actual improvement but what about incremental discussions in the space?\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nNo. Here and there, there are consolidations of steel mills and mines as people are trying to get productivity. We participate in some of the ongoing productivity projects within metals and mining. But the low cost of the resources and the overcapacity is still putting pressure on those verticals.\nAndrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nAll right. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nThanks. And good morning, all. Just to put a finer point on one of your earlier answers. You said that auto saw growth in Q3 and expecting a good Q4. But last quarter you said it was specifically 3% up. What was the number this quarter?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. So auto was up about 1% this quarter.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. And powertrain growth where you're taking some share?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. The powertrain is proceeding as we expected. We've gotten some great commitments this year. And I'd say we're kind of on track for the kind of $20 million incremental that we've been talking about.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. Great. And, Ted, one other thing. On the whole restructuring question, you've got this $10 million placeholder for 4Q. When we had talked about this in the prior quarter, you had talked about $10 million, potentially $20 million. What did you end up executing in the third quarter? And why holding off longer given the broader environment that you're looking at?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. So a couple different pieces to that. First, we've always talked about in our normal course of business we'd expect to spend about $10 million on restructuring over the course of a year. And this year we had provided for an additional $10 million. We have spent some on restructuring earlier in the year. But given the slowdown that we saw in the solutions and services businesses in Q3 and the revised outlook for Q4, we're now kind of taking that into account, as well as assessing what we think we're going to see at least in the first half of next year and we're going through a careful assessment of one, do we need to adjust the cost structure, and two, if we don't need to adjust the cost structure, do we need to do some reallocation of resources so that we can get positioned for what we think the best growth opportunities will be next year. That's a combination of both of those things that have caused us to put some potential restructuring charges into Q4.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. All right. I know we've talked a lot about the fourth quarter, but just so I'm just trying to get some clarity in terms of how you're thinking about that progressing. You've got 4.5 points of easier comps, I guess, up 2.2% to down 2.3% from Q3 to Q4 in 2015. You're calling for roughly down 4% organic growth on top of that in the fourth quarter. You mentioned the solutions and services pressures going into the fourth quarter. But given the lapping of the comps at this point, are you thinking about at least \u2013 and I know we don't get guidance for a little while for 2017, but are you thinking about exiting 2016 at that weaker rate for some time to come, or can you picture this as actually probably sort of a shorter-term issue?\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nSo, we're going to defer any discussions about 2017 until we provide guidance in November. But I would say, particularly in the solutions and services businesses, our comparisons start to get a little bit easier after Q4.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. All right. And they are getting easier in Q4 too though, right?\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nWell, not necessarily in solutions and services.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. That's just the broader segment.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nYeah.\nSteven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC\nOkay. All right, I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nThank you. Good morning, and congratulations, Blake.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYes. My first question I guess, maybe just a little bit of clarification on China auto. With the light vehicle tax stimulus potentially rolling at the end of this calendar year, have you guys sensed that you've gotten any benefit from the tax stimulus being in place in the first place?\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nNo. We haven't seen any direct impact from that stimulus on accelerating or increasing the number of projects in the pipeline.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nOkay. Great. And then, maybe a couple of quick hits on the margins. Ted, did you \u2013 this year, was there any impact from the FX hedges? I know last year you had some gains come through. Was there anything that was impacting your margins this year on the FX side?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. That's something else we've been talking about all year. Our hedges are rolling year-over-year and they're rolling kind of with a lower benefit. So we've still got hedge gains this year but lower hedge gains than we had a year ago. And it's about $13 million on a year-over-year basis.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nGot it. The $13 million is incrementally lower than last year? Is that the right way to think about it?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. Yes.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nOkay. All right. Great. And then maybe just on the 4Q margins. I know last year you guys had elevated R&D spend. Your margins in your A&S segment were down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis. And so are there some potential tailwinds that we should expect in the fourth quarter from just a comps perspective?\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nThere are always a lot of puts and takes on a year-over-year basis. But I think I'd repeat what I said earlier about fourth quarter margins. Sequentially, it's likely margin will be down a little bit Q3 to Q4. We don't expect to see the same pop in solutions and services sales that we normally see. So we're not going to have that volume leverage this year, that same volume leverage. I think sequentially spending is going to be a little bit higher in Q4. And we've got that potential restructuring charge sitting in Q4 where there was very little restructuring charge in Q3. So those are all the reasons that I think we're going to see a little bit lower sequential margin.\nJoe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nOkay. Gotcha. That's helpful. Thank you.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nOperator, we will take one more question.\nOperator\nAnd our final question is from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead.\nJeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC\nThanks. Good morning. And welcome, Blake.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks, Jeremie.\nJeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC\nJust a quick question on the cash flows here. We've seen quite a bit of change in terms of your geographic mix now with North America business coming under pressure. I wonder how does this affect your ability to continue to return excess cash to shareholders in a tax efficient way. And are you willing to take on more debt as you did last year to continue with this strategy? Thanks.\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nYeah. So subject to what our acquisition spending is we continue to be committed to deploying our full excess free cash flow to share owners either through dividend or share repurchase. And as you mentioned, we did that last year and it required taking on a little bit more debt. I think you're going to see the same thing this year. And so I think the answer to the question is yes. There was another question in there about kind of weakness in the U.S. and I'm guessing you're asking about distribution of cash flows. I would say that has not changed significantly for us as a consequence of the U.S. market conditions.\nJeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC\nThanks very much, and good luck.\nTheodore D. Crandall - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\nThank you.\nBlake D. Moret - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\nThanks.\nPatrick Goris - Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations\nOkay. That concludes today's call. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thank you, DeLou. Good morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year and some commentary on our outlook. Then Ted will review the results for the quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2013. He will also spend some time today going through the components of pension expense, our new definition of segment operating earnings and our new non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings per share. We'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks.","Our results today were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. In addition, our supplemental financial data document is available on our website, and it includes reconciliations to our new non-GAAP EPS and segment earnings by quarter for 2008 through 2012.","A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. We appreciate you starting your week with us today. We've got a lot to cover, so the call may go a little bit longer than an hour.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of the company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying to anyone affected by last week's hurricane and its aftermath that I appreciate your efforts to join our call today. I hope you were able to stay out of harm's way.","I'll start with highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. I was pleased with 5% organic growth, especially given the tough comparison to last year's very strong fourth quarter. Growth rates continued to moderate due to the difficult economic environment, but once again, we had organic growth in all regions. Emerging markets grew 11% in the quarter with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe and Africa.","Most of the growth this quarter came from our solutions businesses as our product businesses were essentially flat compared to last year. Process had another great quarter with 18% growth.","In the quarter, we initiated restructuring actions with corresponding charges of about $13 million. We're calling this out because the charges are considerably higher than a normal run rate for pay-as-you-go actions. These restructuring actions provide us with some headroom to rebalance investments in 2013.","Earnings per share were $1.38, about $0.01 lower than last year. Restructuring charges reduced EPS by about $0.07. Cash flow in the quarter was strong, and we repurchased another 1.4 million shares. So overall, a good end to a very solid year.","I'll make a few comments on the full year before I move to our outlook. We entered 2012 in the midst of global economic uncertainty, and that is still the prevailing environment. The prospects of a fiscal cliff in the U.S., the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe and the slowdown in key emerging markets all weighed on economic growth this year. Despite that, we delivered organic growth of 6% for the full year and ended the year with record sales of up over $6.2 billion.","Canada had very strong growth of 20%, reflecting continued strength in the resource-based industries. Mexico also grew 20%, and industrial activity there remained strong. But our European region was the real standout with 6% organic growth in the face of a recession. I was encouraged that we grew in both developed and emerging EMEA, and I want to our acknowledge the EMEA leadership team who executed very well within difficult market conditions.","It's not on the chart, but Process sales grew 20% for the full year, and we continue to win both batch and continuous process applications. I was pleased that we were able to expand segment operating margin a full point while continuing to invest for growth.","Continued strong cash flow and a healthy balance sheet enabled us to increase the dividend for the third consecutive year and repurchase 3.7 million shares. We're proud of our track record of returning cash to share owners.","We delivered solid results in a challenging environment this year. I want to thank our employees for their dedication in making this year possible and our customers, suppliers and partners for their continued support throughout the year.","So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2013. Growth rates moderated considerably as we moved through fiscal '12, and our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat. We saw an increase in project delays in Q4 and ended the year with a lower solutions backlog than a year ago. So there's not a lot of positive momentum as we enter the new year.","Each region has its own story, but the global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam at the moment. We continue to believe this is a pause in the recovery and not an inflection point, which is consistent with what we are hearing from our sales organization, our channel partners and customers. The forecast that we monitor for GDP and industrial production call for growth next year. But consistent with those forecasts and given current conditions and our lower backlog, we don't expect to see much growth until the second half of 2013.","It's possible that the current global economic sluggishness is creating some pent-up demand for manufacturing investment. If that is true, a couple of positive macroeconomic signals could give customers confidence to accelerate their spending. We're counting on market conditions improving early enough to have a positive impact on the second half of our fiscal 2013. We're excited about and counting on new products to help us grow next year, even in sluggish market conditions.","From a regional perspective, we expect the U.S. to stay on a low growth track, and we don't think Europe gets any worse. Asia Pacific and Latin America should have higher growth rates next year, driven primarily by improvements in China and Brazil.","With all of that said, we expect total sales growth of 2% to 6% next year. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Although we can't control the economy, we know how to remain flexible and adjust to the underlying economic environment as appropriate. In the end, with our great technology, talented and dedicated employees, loyal partners, robust installed base and share gain opportunities, we're well positioned to continue to outperform the market.","Before I wrap up, I want to assure you that Automation affair -- Automation Fair events this week will continue as planned. Downtown Philadelphia, the convention center and hotels sustained minimal or no damage. We feel extremely fortunate that Automation Fair, its supporting events and our investor conference will proceed as scheduled. But the people in businesses affected by Hurricane Sandy do remain in our thoughts. For those of you who haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. It is a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers.","At the investor conference on Thursday, you'll hear from John McDermott, the leader of our global sales and marketing team, and from one of our major global customers. Then we will take you on a hosted tour of the show floor. After lunch, we will hold a webcast where you will learn more about our strategy and progress from me and Ted. Frank Kulaszewicz, the Head of our Architecture & Software segment, and Blake Moret, the Head of our Control Products & Solutions segment, will provide a deeper dive into 2 of our best growth opportunities, process and OEMs. We are really pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity to learn more about us, and we look forward to seeing you there.","So with that, I will turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2013. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everybody. A lot to cover this morning, and I'll start with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,664,000,000. That's an increase of 1% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 5%, and the year-over-year impact of currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by approximately 4 points. Segment operating earnings were $295 million, down 1% compared to last year.","As Keith mentioned, we incurred restructuring charges of approximately $13 million in the quarter. General corporate net expense was $20.6 million compared to $22.2 million a year ago. The effect of tax rate in the quarter was 23.4%. That's 2.2 points higher than fourth quarter last year.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.38, down $0.01 compared to Q4 last year. The restructuring charges reduced earnings per share by about $0.07 cents. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.5 million. In Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of approximately $96 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 3.7 million shares at a cost of $265 million. On the earnings call in July, we projected to repurchase about 3 million shares for the full year, so we were more aggressive than that in the quarter.","Turning to Page 6. Fourth quarter results were up for automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see that sales increased only slightly from last year. That's the currency effect offsetting the 5% organic growth. You might remember that Q4 fiscal '11 was a particularly strong quarter, especially in our solutions and services businesses, and sales in the fourth quarter this year were up 7% sequentially.","Moving to earnings on the right side of the chart. Segment operating margin in Q4 was 17.7%, down a bit from 18% in Q4 last year. Lots of puts and takes on margin in the quarter, but the $13 million in restructuring charges reduced operating margin by about 80 basis points. So margin would have been about 18.5% without those charges, and I think that would've been pretty much as expected. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 30.3%, about the same as last quarter.","Moving on to Page 7. This slide displays the Q4 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $671 million in the quarter, down about 2% year-over-year. Organic growth of 3% was more than offset by a currency translation impact that reduced sales by 5 points. Sequentially, Architecture & Software sales increased 1%. Operating margin for the quarter was 24.8%, down 1.2 points from Q4 last year. About 1\/2 of the restructuring charges were incurred in this segment. Excluding those charges, margins were down about 20 basis points compared to last year.","The next slide, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Control Products & Solutions sales in Q4 were $993 million. That's up 2% from a year ago. Currency translation reduced sales by 4 points, so organic growth was 6%. Sales in the product portion of CP&S in Q4 were down a little year-over-year, but sales for the solutions and service businesses were up 12%, a pretty strong performance, and as I mentioned earlier, against the difficult year-ago comparison for the solutions and services businesses.","However, orders for solutions and services were weak in the quarter. The book-to-bill was only 0.8. It's typical for the solutions and services book-to-bill to be below one in our fourth quarter, but 0.8 is lower than normal. As Keith mentioned, we saw an increasing number of projects being delayed in Q4, particularly larger projects, and that was pretty much the case in all regions. Our backlog in the solutions and services businesses is down approximately 7% compared to this time last year.","Moving to the right side of the slide. Segment operating earnings increased 7% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded by 0.6 to 13%. Control Products & Solutions also incurred about 1\/2 of the restructuring charges, which reduced margins in the quarter by about 0.6 points. That offset some of the benefit of higher volume.","Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column that displays the year-over-year growth excluding currency effects. As we discussed on the last earnings call, growth rates have clearly moderated from earlier in the year. Despite that, as Keith mentioned, we realized organic growth in every region in Q4. Canada has been consistently strong this year with 18% organic growth this quarter.","EMEA organic growth was 7%, better than we expected coming into the quarter. We're continuing to benefit from our success with OEM customers and saw particularly strong growth in the emerging countries in this region.","Asia Pacific was up only 2% compared to fourth quarter last year. There was very mixed performance across the countries in the region. China was up 11% year-over-year. India was about flat to Q4 last year, and Australia was down significantly.","Latin America was up 8% compared to Q4 last year, and that was with Brazil down about 4%. There was continued strong growth in the balance of the Latin American region and, particularly, in Mexico.","I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $347 million. The conversion on net income was 178%. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $598 million. That represents conversion on net income of 81%. And if you exclude the discretionary pension contribution that we made in the first quarter, conversion for the full year would've been 105%. So that's the fourth quarter.","I'll turn now to Page 11 for a summary of the full year results for fiscal '12. Sales reached $6,259,000,000 for the full year, up 4%. Organic growth was 6%. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3 points, and acquisitions added a little less than 1 point. Segment operating margin for the full year was 18.1%, up 1 full point from last year. Diluted EPS from continuing operations was $5.13, up 7% compared to last year, and I think Keith already mentioned that this represents another year of record sales and EPS for the company.","Since we already covered cash flow, I'll move to Slide 12, which describes the new approach we're taking to the way we deal with pension expense and some of our earnings measures. Significant declines in interest rates over the past several years have caused an extraordinary increase in our pension expense. We consider a large portion of that pension expense increase to be unrelated to our underlying operating performance. Because of this, beginning in fiscal '13, we've decided to introduce new non-GAAP measures that exclude nonoperating pension cost from our income from continuing operations and corresponding EPS, and we are also changing our definition of segment operating earnings to exclude the nonoperating pension class.","As shown on the right side of the slide, we're defining nonoperating pension costs to include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any planned curtailments or settlements. We consider service costs related to active employees to be operating pension costs. We believe that the nonoperating components of pension costs are more related to financial market factors and that excluding them presents an earnings picture more reflective of our underlying operating performance and also allows for more relevant historical comparisons.","Let's turn to Slide 13. This next slide provides a sense of the extent to which the nonoperating pension costs have impacted our results over time and why we think it's important to provide better visibility of that impact. The 3 columns to the left display the operating and nonoperating components of pension expense for fiscal 2008 and 2012, along with our projection of pension expense for fiscal 2013.","The far right column, which is labeled 2013 better than, worse than 2008, shows the difference in the components of pension expense between those 2 years. In the 5-year period, total GAAP pension expense increased by $140 million. You can see that total at the bottom of the column. That total GAAP pension expense increase represents more than a 2-point negative impact on operating margins in 2013 compared to 2008. The nonoperating component of that pension expense increase is $104 million or almost 75% of the increase. We think it's important for investors to understand the impact of the nonoperating pension expense.","The second column from the right side of the slide shows the difference between the components of pension expense for 2012 compared to 2013. For 2013, we're projecting a $64 million increase in the total GAAP pension expense. The nonoperating portion of that increase is $44 million or about 70% of the increase. It's important to note that even with this change, there's still a $20 million increase in the operating pension cost in 2013. The operating pension cost will continue to be included in our segment operating earnings.","The next slide, Slide 14, provides a walk from our fiscal 2012 GAAP results to the new non-GAAP measures so that we can provide investors with a consistent comparison against our fiscal '13 guidance. Focusing on the middle column, which displays the adjustments, I'll start with segment operating earnings, which would have been $32.5 million higher in fiscal '12 under the new definition of segment operating earnings. General corporate net expense would've been $2.7 million lower, so total income before taxes would've been $35.2 million higher. After tax, that yields an earnings per share add back of $0.16. So adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '12 would've been $5.29 compared to $5.13 as reported.","Segment operating margin increases by 0.5 point under the new definition of segment operating earnings to 18.6%, and the effective tax rate also increases by about 40 basis points. As Rondi mentioned at the beginning of the call, reconciliations of earnings per share and segment operating earnings annually and by quarter back to 2008 are available in the supplemental data book that's posted to our external website.","So now let me turn to Slide 15, and we can discuss guidance for fiscal year '13. Regarding the top line, Keith provided a good deal of color on our views of the economic and market environment we're expecting in 2013. I'll repeat just a couple of key points: growth rates moderated throughout fiscal '12, our current underlying demand trends are pretty flat and there's not much positive momentum as we enter the new year. The global economic recovery seems to have run out of steam, but we still think this is a pause, not an inflection point. We expect to see improved market conditions in 2013, but we don't expect to see any significant improvement until the latter part of the year.","Given that context, we expect fiscal 2013 sales to be in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.65 billion. That's 1% to 5% organic growth. We expect currency and acquisitions to each add about 0.5 point of growth. So that's the makeup of the 2% to 6% growth that Keith highlighted.","We expect segment operating margin to be about 18.7%. That compares to the restated fiscal '12 segment operating margin of 18.6%. Think of the 18.7% as the midpoint of guidance, so maybe a little bit higher or lower across the sales range. Not a significant margin improvement year-over-year, but at the midpoint, we're at a relatively modest 3% organic growth. And even with our new definition of segment operating earnings, we're absorbing a $20 million increase in pension expense.","As Keith noted, our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.35 to $5.75, and that compares to EPS of $5.29 for fiscal '12 on an adjusted basis. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted net income of about 100% in fiscal '13. And then maybe a couple of other items that aren't shown here: we expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $83 million, about equal to fiscal '12; we expect an effective tax rate in fiscal '13 of about 26%; and we expect the average share count next year to be between 139 million and 140 million shares.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin the Q&A session","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, great.  Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] So, operator, why don't we go ahead and take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And it's from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I know visibility isn't all that great. But when you think about 2013 guidance, I mean, how did -- what are your customers telling you as far as kind of the mix between CapEx-related, project-related things and the regular daily flow of products that are more driven by capacity utilization? Is there -- are you thinking in terms of CapEx being flattish next year or actually down?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, it's a little early to get a read on the CapEx because most people are calendar year, and we really hear that more in our second quarter. But I would say from -- anecdotally, at least, from the commentary we're hearing, we don't expect that it will be an increase from where we're currently seeing it. And the question will be, I think, how do some of these other factors play out over the next couple of months, particularly the fiscal cliff and elections in the U.S. and the debt and the euro crisis potential that remains in Europe. So I think those are the factors that we need to get some, I'll just say, better clarity and certainty around to be able to understand what is going on. Also, some of our customers, at this point, I think, are taking a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude. But I think that's more around, I'll just say, the OpEx type of projects than the larger capital investments that typically require higher level of approvals.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And just as a follow-up, just wanted to talk about cash reinvestment. Not really much in -- I mean, you bought 3.7 million shares. It's respectable, but you're still sitting on a fair amount of cash and have balance sheet space. Can you just talk us through what the plans are in the next 12 months?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. Sure, Scott. First, I think we're pretty pleased with our track record of returning cash to share owners. And over the past 3 years, we've returned about $1.3 billion in dividend and share repurchase and, at the same time, made some pretty sizable contributions to the U.S. pension trust. We've increased the dividend by over 60% in the last 3 years, so we're reasonably pleased with that track record. We had that large pension contribution this year, which held down our repurchases a bit. But next year, we would expect repurchases to be in the range of $400 million, so significantly higher than the $265 million we spent this year. And depending on share pricing or if we're in a range that's close to where we have been recently, that ought to be in the range of 5 million to 5.5 million shares.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","We're obviously in this kind of a follow-your-nose type of environment. It's a -- there's not a ton of visibility. I know you guys don't like to give quarterly guidance. But I guess, just kind of looking at the better sales this quarter, the backlog and the weak book-to-bill at solutions, there's a lot of kind of things that are moving around, some positive and some negative. Last year, you guys had a pretty tough 4Q to 1Q, where you were down, I guess, around 10% sequentially, given some project timing headwinds. I mean, is that the same type of sequential decline we should expect heading into the first quarter here? And again, it's kind of an unusual environment because you said it's going to ramp in the back half. So I'm just -- I want to make sure that I'm kind of calibrated on the model when it comes to this stuff.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, I think that's a fair characterization. It's a similar situation we found ourselves in last year. We need to rebuild our solutions backlog. That's going to take some period of time. And certainly, we, typically, historically see, even independent of the backlog, a reduction in our Q4. We typically see a softer Q1 in our solutions business already. So I think those -- that combination of traditional reduction, plus the accelerated amount of backlog that we burned off and the weaker orders portend a softer first half of the year in our solutions business.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And so that down 11 sequentially would be kind of flattish organically year-over-year. Ted, is that right?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I would expect. If you think about the 3% growth for the full year organically, I would expect the first half to be flat to up a little bit maybe and then better growth in the second half.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up on that, I guess you're talking about a pause. You're talking about kind of a little bit more confidence that things are -- will maybe come back. And can you maybe talk about the run rate of conversations or, I guess, you talk about a front log or RFPs, RFQs, things like that, has that softened dramatically, call it, relative to 6 months ago? I mean, how is the kind of pool of addressable business, outside of the obviously ongoing MRO stuff, but the pool of addressable targets trended over the last 6 months? And how -- if it's gotten weaker, how much weaker has it gotten?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We have not seen any real change in the front log or the, I'll just say, quoting activities over the last 6 months. It's been pretty flat, so we haven't seen it going up. But we haven't seen much of a change in that dimension of activity. Where the real change has been in the last 6 months has been in Q3. We talked about project delays, and the majority of that was in the front log areas. And then in Q4, that picked up even a little more. So I would say the activity remains constant, or relatively constant. But the decision making is taking longer to close orders than it had in the first half of our fiscal '12. So I would say that's where the change has occurred as opposed to, I'll just say, engineering fee projects and quotations. And I think I'd characterize it that way.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And is that similar to the kind of the infamous air pocket comment that you guys made, I guess, in '04, '05, remember that point? I mean, how different does it feel relative to that or maybe the same? And then that's my last question.","Keith D. Nosbusch","You have a good memory. That goes quite a bit back. But I just think every period is unique in its own way, and I think to characterizes it back to that point in time, I believe the -- over the economic environment is very different today. So I think it's more just a -- the uncertainty is creating less than confidence in the -- in their outlook, and therefore, they're just delaying decisions and waiting to see how a few things unfold before they make commitments. And it's just -- we're just in a period that, that has to play out, and ultimately, it'll go one way or the other. But at this point, we're just seeing the uncertainty as the -- is the overriding, I'll just say, behavior.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The first question was really on the color by end markets. What are you seeing in things like automotive versus broader consumer versus, I guess, heavy industry? How has that changed in the past couple of months? And which industries are you seeing the biggest shifts in projects, in terms of sign-off delays and so forth?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I guess a couple of things. Where we see the strongest activities continues to be in automotive and oil and gas, and that would be pretty much on a global basis. If you look at heavy industries and you take oil and gas out of there, I would say, currently, where we're seeing the greatest slowdown in buying at this point would be mining, is probably the toughest area at this point in time. Some of that is driven by labor situations, such as you have in South Africa. Some of it is demand from China and India impacting Australia, and some of it is just the environmental issues associated with some of the large new mines, particularly in Latin America. So it's probably created a slowing of investments, and I think that's the area that we see it the most. With respect to consumer, I think we still see -- consumer isn't one that has high peaks and high -- and low valleys, so I think it's stayed pretty well flat. But there's no question that the global investment in consumer products is more in -- is being slanted more to the emerging markets than it is to, I'll just say, the U.S. and Western Europe.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up just on the segment margin guidance of a slight increase in fiscal '13. Yes, you talked about what the operating pension cost effect is, and there's some volume leverage in that as well. But how about sort 2 or 3 other things, in particular, mix or the delta of savings versus restructuring charges and kind of input cost versus price, how are you assuming those move around inside that margin guidance?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So let me start and, hopefully, I'll hit all the points you just made. We would expect a small favorable impact from mix because across -- if you think about our guidance range, I'd say across -- of sales growth, across that range, we would expect product growth to be maybe 1 point higher than the company average and solutions and services to be about 1 point lower, so a little bit of favorable mix impact. On price, material cost, I would say we expect a small positive contribution. We'd expect price to be less than 1 point, similar to what we're seeing in 2012. And I would say we expect some modest material cost increases, purely on the commodity side, if anything, neutral to maybe slightly favorable. We talked about, obviously, the pension headwind. Was there one other item you had there, Julian?","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, sure. It was just on kind of the net of savings versus restructuring charges.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, great question. Right now, our intention is not to take those savings from the restructuring actions in Q4 to the bottom line, but rather, to use those to kind of rebalance our investments as we go into 2013. Now as we proceed into 2013, if market conditions turn out to be worse than we were expecting, we may not redeploy all of that.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","First question on Logix. Can you just provide some color around what Logix was doing in the quarter? And any more pressure competitively in terms of traction there, given the fact that customers are, as you mentioned, putting off decision making at this point?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Logix -- organic growth for Logix in the quarter was 6% year-over-year, and for the full year, it was 8% growth. So we're happy with the performance of Logix in the year. I think our ability to continue to expand the platform, in particular, with a number of -- actually, 3 new midrange platforms, gives us optimism. And that's why my comments about we're pleased with our new products, but we're also counting on those new products to drive growth in this next fiscal year. So I don't believe delays or customer -- lack of customer certainty has impacted disproportionately anything associated with our Logix business, and I think we are better positioned, going into '13, with these new platforms than we were coming into '12. So I think it's an area that can help us across-the-board, both in process, as well as our OEM initiatives. And whether that be in emerging markets or mature economies, we think it -- the broadening of the portfolio bodes well for us going forward.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Are those the best growth -- when you -- you mentioned best growth opportunities in the release and a couple times on this call. Is that what you're talking about?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. And to Ted's point, part of the redeployment of resources with the headroom we created from our restructuring actions are to do just that, to focus on our core platforms and to support the commercial initiatives, particularly the emerging markets. So we do see that as a -- as one of the better opportunities, and process in OEMs remain right up there as far as where we think we have the greatest long-term growth potential.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And second question, you mentioned EMEA -- or EMEA was up 7% in the quarter, organically. Where was that? What'd Western Europe do? And I mean, are you assuming you can keep that up for 2013, and how?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think it was interesting, Europe, because it was a combination of good growth in a lot of the emerging Europe, which would be, for us, Central and Eastern Europe, including Russia and then the Middle East and South Africa. So that was significant growth, double-digit growth in the quarter. I think Western Europe was more mixed. We had some very good success in a couple of countries and, in particular, good success in the U.K., good success in some of the northern countries. And really, the greatest weakness for us was in Italy and mainly because of the financial issues there that's impacting both the end users in Italy, as well as the machine builders. So I would say in Western Europe, Italy was the weakest performer for us. As far as being able to keep it up next year, we believe that Europe will be at the -- below the company average, and I think it really depends upon how does the financial and the debt crisis there and the euro crisis unfold. As we said, we're not expecting it to deteriorate from here. But we're not counting on a lot of growth from the mature economies, and we think we'll see above-average growth in the emerging.","Operator","The next question is from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just would like to understand the organic growth guide a little bit more, Ted and Keith. So if you look at volumes and the normal seasonal pattern today, and based on all the puts and takes that you've described, does the midpoint of your guide assume that in fiscal '13, business conditions, all else equal, are relatively static? Or are you assuming, as I think, Keith, you mentioned, some second half improvement? Or is the second half improvement really a function of getting to the 5% within the range?","Theodore D. Crandall","No, John. I would say even at midpoint, we would expect first half to be relatively flat to current conditions, maybe slightly better. But then most of the growth has to come in the second half.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So some companies have gotten into trouble though by forecasting macroeconomic improvement. And I'm just curious, is this a -- I realize you have some visibility with respect to backlogs. Obviously, you're discussing a lot with your customers. Is this a little bit of an inventory build, or is it process? Or I mean, what would give you the confidence at this juncture to assume that in your June quarter, you're going to start to see a pickup, or is it sort of aspirational? Or just a little more color would be helpful.","Theodore D. Crandall","I would not call it aspirational. But I think we've been pretty consistent saying we don't believe we have visibility that goes out more than 6 months, especially from an order and backlog point of view. I think what we're looking at is conversations we're having with our sales organization, our channel, our customers. We're looking at the macroeconomic projections that are put out there by people like Global Insight. I would say, generally, what we're seeing in those macroeconomic projections, and I think this is also true of IMF, is that there's expected growth next year, but generally weighted toward the latter half. We're also hopeful that once we get past the elections and the fiscal cliff, that hopefully, that will reduce some of the uncertainty we have in North America right now. So we think that's consistent with the notion of whatever's going to happen in our fiscal 2013, it is more likely to be positive in the second half.","Keith D. Nosbusch","The only thing that I would add to that, John, is quite frankly, that's why we have a range. And if you go at the low end of that range, we're not assuming anything in the second half. And if you go to the high end of the range, it kind of fits what Ted just talked about. So I think that range allows all of you to make your best estimate of how you see it playing out from your window. But certainly, we see the potential to operate across that range, and I think the dynamic that Ted talked about is what moves it from the low end to the high end.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So that -- no, that clarifies it. That's quite helpful. Let me ask you then, Ted. At the midpoint, right, of your EPS assumption, you're assuming $5.55 versus $5.29 x the pension nonoperating costs. Now I realize you've got this extra -- you've got the service cost increasing by about $0.10 and $0.11. That's still giving you a -- it's sort of a still kind of an anemic, if you will, variable contribution. I think I'm just going back to the 18.7, right, versus 18.6. I realized if you x the 20 million, it's about 30 basis points. But what kind of variable profit conversion are you assuming? And shouldn't this -- the lower solution, shouldn't that actually be helping your mix a little bit more? Like why is there not a little bit more volume leverage?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. Well, there's -- so at the midpoint, conversion is a little bit over 20%. And if you add it back, the pension expense increase, conversion would be close to 30%. And we think with 3% organic growth being at the low end of kind of what we normally talk about of that normal range in the upside, call it, 30% to 40%, we think that's pretty good performance.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So your midpoint is assuming the low end of your historical range of a 30% to 40%. That's the way to think about it.","Theodore D. Crandall","Without the pension expense increase.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. No, I understand. And the reason for that is just because overall uncertainty, you're just being conservative or what?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I don't think so. I mean, I think it's simply that the lower that organic growth number is, we just don't get as much volume leverage.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's fair. Lastly, China. I think China was up 5% last quarter, up 11% this quarter. Keith, what are you seeing in China? Like what are you sort of seeing on a sequential basis whether you're on brownfield, people telling you -- because companies are, for all intents and purposes, saying it's a flat, but some have actually called out perhaps a degree of improvement.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think we're seeing mixed at this point, John. China, we have not seen any impact, or I should say, meaningful impact yet of the stimulus, particularly in some of the infrastructure projects. We do expect a little bit of help of that in fiscal '13. But they still have challenges with respect to liquidity, particularly for the small and midsized customers, and their exports, particularly given the impact of Europe to their export industries, continues to be a challenge. So we see China as having another tough year. But a tough year for them means it's still meaningful growth. GDP has dropped down into the 7s with the last one continuing to bring it down. They're going through a leadership change. I think this first quarter here, it'll be a little bit uncertain, and I think we'll get a little more clarity as to what that does positive or negative as we get past the Chinese New Year. So we see China as mixed at this point in time. And we're still very optimistic and bullish on China in the long term, but we have to get through the current environment.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But your guide doesn't assume China deterioration. It's assuming...","Keith D. Nosbusch","No. We think China, overall, will perform slightly higher than it did for us this year. That's our plan for next year. And we -- as you know, we had a very, very weak start in China last year. We ended much, much stronger, and we think we will be slightly ahead of the fiscal year performance.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Can we talk pension a little bit? What's the funded status of the plan at year end?","Theodore D. Crandall","We were underfunded by $930 million at year end, which is slightly higher underfunding than year-end last year. And so basically, the drop in the discount rate pretty much offset the favorable contribution we got, both out of asset returns and the pension contribution we made in October.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then what do you see for pension contributions in 2013, if any?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think in terms of discretionary contributions, we would not expect a discretionary contribution in 2013. So our normal level of pension contributions, primarily related to plans outside the U.S., is about $40 million.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And what percent of the current plan participants are current employees? And is the plan still open?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, the plan was closed to new participants. This is generally true for our defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. They were closed to new participants in 2010, but they remain open for active participants. Offhand, I do not know the percent of employees active versus not active. I would guess it's probably about 40% active versus 60% not active. I can -- I'll check that for you and let Rondi get back to you if that's not correct.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And then just going forward, are you going to report kind of full detailed GAAP, non-GAAP, so if we want to keep track of what the GAAP numbers actually look like, we'll be able to do that?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, I just wanted to dig into A&S margins a little bit. You talked about the restructuring, and that accounted for the bulk of the year-over-year decline. But then you called out Logix growth of 6%, which is, to me, that comes with decent margin. Just wondering, were there any negative mixes that offset that Logix growth?","Theodore D. Crandall","I would say nothing significant in the quarter, and I would also say the Logix growth versus the average of A&S wasn't a significant mix boost for us. I think if you look at A&S, we've always said the margins are going to be somewhat variable quarter-to-quarter, in part because of the high underlying contribution margin potential. If you look at the full year, A&S margins were 26.5% for the full year, which was up almost 1 point from last year. I think that's representative of the underlying performance of the business.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And we talked about what the 1Q seasonality within the CP&S, but A&S margins normally pick up from 4Q fiscal into 1Q fiscal. Would you expect that to reoccur this year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think you are correct in your historical observation. Since we don't provide quarterly guidance, I don't want to comment on what I think A&S is going to be next quarter.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And, Ted, you gave us the solutions book-to-bill. I know you're very short cycle, so the products book-to-bill is not that meaningful a metric. But do you have the number offhand?","Theodore D. Crandall","I don't have the number offhand, but I think you're right. Because that is such short cycle, we typically don't have a big difference in book-to-bill on product","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just switching to the pension change. You had the option to -- I guess, you considered switching to mark-to-market. You opted to go for a nonoperating metric. You just -- maybe just quickly, why did you decide not to go with the mark-to-market route? Because it seems that most of the U.S. companies are adopting that change of accounting.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I think that's a fair question. We felt that the most important thing was try and provide investors transparency into the nonoperating versus operating pension costs. We thought we could accomplish that without changing the underlying GAAP accounting. And we thought it was a positive that in choosing the method we chose, we don't have to make these large fourth quarter GAAP adjustments that are a consequence of the mark-to-market adjustment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. And by the way, I appreciate all the detail you provided on the restatements. That's really helpful. And then just quickly on Logix. You set a target of $1 billion this year. Did you get there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We were just under it this year, and we certainly are going to go over it early in our fiscal year. But the difference between organic and with currency caused us to be just slightly under. So we're pleased with where we're at. We almost got to that metric of $1 billion, and we're going to look forward to blowing through it this fiscal year.","Operator","Next question is from Winnie Clark of UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you just talk a little bit about -- actually back to the quarter. It seems that results were better than what you would've expected going into the quarter. Can you kind of talk about how things trended? Was September better than the prior months, et cetera, throughout the quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","You're breaking up a little bit, so let me see if I can repeat the question and make sure we got it. You're asking [indiscernible] the sales numbers came in a little bit better than expected in the quarter and could we talk a little bit about how things trended through Q4.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's right.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay, I'd be happy to do that. Well, I think most of you know that our fourth quarter is very heavily weighted to September performance. And September, once again, was our strongest month in the quarter both in orders and sales, and nothing unusual there. I would say it was our typical pattern that we have every year, given the holidays, particularly in the July-August time frame, both in Europe and more and more in the U.S., so very consistent. With respect to October, we believe what we have seen so far is consistent with the guidance we gave and with the commentary that we talked about with first half and second half and our solutions backlog reduction in Q4.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then on Process, obviously, very strong growth this year. Being that your solutions backlog is a bit weaker and you expect some weaker mix next year, how do you think about Process next year relative to the company average growth?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. We think Process will be closer to the company average growth this next year than the significant ink of above-company performance that we had this year. And you're exactly right. It's mainly driven by the softness in orders the last 2 quarters, so not the performance difference that we had this year, but still, ongoing growth and, still, the area that we believe has the greatest long-term potential for us.","Operator","And it's from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","In terms of the pause amidst the uncertainty out there, I mean, is this kind of amorphous commentary you're getting back from customers in the channel? Or do you hear one thing more than the other? I mean, are people bringing up mainly fiscal clip -- cliff, mainly Europe? I mean, do you have any ability to kind of rank order what you tend to hear the most to give us a little feel for when people are going to get over this uncertainty?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, no. I mean, with -- and the reason I say that is with 50 -- more than 50% of our sales outside the U.S., we hear an eclectic set of feedback. And I think the U.S., the predominance is the fiscal cliff and what's going to happen with taxes and what's going to happen with my cost with all the regulation and the healthcare. So I think there is this great uncertainty in the U.S. as to can I make a long-term investment decision without knowing a little more as to what the rules of the game are going to be for some period of time. And I would think there, that is the predominant question that's on people's minds. If you go to Europe, I think it's just -- they haven't solved the fiscal sovereign debt crisis, and everyone's waiting to see will there be some definitive conclusion to that. And the emerging markets are kind of just -- I think you see a little mix there with the emerging markets that have strong exporting, wondering what's happening in the U.S. and Western Europe. And I think where the ongoing positive activity is, is in their indigenous markets and, in particular, in some of the automotive, some of the consumer product areas. That's where we see the least dependence upon what's going on in the rest of the world in those emerging markets and, really, what is the form of government stimulus that is being applied there, which, traditionally, is much more infrastructure types of projects. So it's varied, and I think each region has a unique set of concerns. And that's the backdrop that we see this pause and ongoing uncertainty and, therefore, lack of confidence to make ongoing investments.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just in terms of -- one follow-up on China. You said you haven't seen sort of the evidence of the stimulus yet, but you expect some in '13, I think. I mean, in terms of the pipeline of things that are on the table over there, I mean, any particular verticals or areas of investment that you think you have some visibility into benefiting from?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, their stimulus is heavily focused into infrastructures, so metro systems. They always -- not always. Last time, as well as this time, they're accelerating projects that would've been done later. But now, they move them up, and they have more lines going in, in parallel than they would have previously. And we still see some strength in oil and gas in China, particularly some of the offshore activities are strong and automotive is not as strong as it used to be, but it's still a healthy sector. And then as I mentioned earlier, the indigenous food and consumer industries, with their growing middle class, is an area that we still see good investment by both indigenous, as well as multinational companies.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks, Frances. Good morning, and thanks to everyone for joining us on Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the company's performance in the quarter and outlook for the full year, and then Ted will provide more detail on both of those. We'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website, and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I know it's been a busy earnings season for all of you, so I appreciate your time today and your interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter.","So please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. Sales in Q1 were in line with our expectations in total with mixed results by region. Latin America grew 7% with Brazil back to positive growth. U.S. growth was strong at 6%. EMEA declined 2%, as expected, due to flat OEM demand and lower solutions backlog entering the quarter. The negative surprise in the quarter was 9% sales decline in Asia Pacific. China and India were both down in the quarter more than the region average. In China, continued soft economic growth, lack of credit availability and project delays all impacted sales in the quarter. Orders performance was better than sales performance, and we rebuilt backlog in the quarter. I was in China earlier this month, and it feels to me like sentiment for industrial investment is turning a bit more positive, which should help our second -- our results in the second half. I'm confident that we're well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities when growth reaccelerates.","In India, continued economic weakness, tight credit and high interest rates are dampening investment and causing project delays, and we don't see any improvement on the horizon. Process had a small sales decline this quarter, reflecting a weaker solutions backlog coming into the quarter and continued project delays. We continue to believe that process is our best growth opportunity, and I'll talk more about that later.","Before I end my discussion on the top line, let me point out a couple of positives in the quarter. In addition to the strong sales in the U.S. and Latin America, Logix grew 5%, and we were encouraged to see solutions order rates pick up. The solutions and services book-to-bill was 1.23. Those of you who have been following us for a while know that a core part of our strategy is diversification of revenue streams from a geography, industry and application perspective. A quarter like this, where you have areas of strength that make up for pockets of weakness, demonstrates the importance of that strategy. Operating margin of 18.5% in the quarter was good and in line with our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS was $1.23 in the quarter.  So overall, I'd call it a good start to the fiscal year.","Let me share some other highlights of the quarter. CONTROL Magazine, an industry-leading publication exclusively dedicated to the global process automation market, recently issued the results of its Readers' Choice survey. We had our best showing ever with 43 wins in control, industry and product categories, the most of any process company. Of the 6 CONTROL discipline awards, we won 3, with no other company winning more than 1. In the industry vertical awards, we won 30 out of 53. The second-place supplier won only 12. These results are further validation that we are gaining ground as a leading DCS company for process applications. We're getting good traction with new products such as our family of midrange controllers that we've released throughout 2012. We expect this new product momentum to continue, and that along with the cooperation from the global economy will help fuel the increased growth in the second half that's baked into our fiscal year guidance.","In early Q1, we closed on an acquisition in China, a medium voltage drives business headquartered in Harbin. This acquisition positions us well in the fastest-growing region for medium voltage drives adoption and energy-intensive applications. I'm really excited about this group of talented employees, who bring local manufacturing and design capability that will help us serve customers in China and across Asia.","We were honored to receive the Better Business Bureau's 2012 International Torch Award for marketplace excellence. This award reflects our commitment to quality, our customers, our investors and our communities all based on a strong foundation of ethics and integrity. Every employee played a role in this recognition and should be extremely proud.","So let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. Given first quarter results and our current assessment of market conditions, we are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2013 organic growth of 1% to 5%, with corresponding adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $5.75. We think year-over-year growth in Q2 will be similar to Q1, but stabilization of macroeconomic indicators and forecasts, coupled with our rebuilt backlog, reinforce our expectations of increasing industrial activity, resulting in stronger growth in the second half of our fiscal year. We're planning to continue to invest in innovation and customer-facing resources, but we'll monitor business conditions closely and pace our investments accordingly. While the economy is not as robust as we all would like it to be and business conditions remain challenging, we're seeing signs of stabilization that are encouraging. We're going to stay focused on providing value to our customers and executing our strategy. If we do that, we'll continue to outgrow the market. We have a great franchise with great employees and partners that know how to be flexible, collaborative and responsive to customers' needs. That's what will enable us to grow and deliver superior return to our share owners.","Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2013. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith. All right, good morning, everybody. As Rondi mentioned, we posted a set of slides at the website, and my comments are going to reference those slides. I'll start with Page 5, which is the first quarter results summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,489,000,000, up 1% compared to the first quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 0.5 point, and acquisitions contributed less than 0.5 point. Organic growth was 1.5%.","As I move to segment operating earnings, I'll take the opportunity to remind you that consistent with our discussions on last quarter's earnings call, beginning with this first quarter of fiscal '13, we've adopted a new approach to dealing with pension expense in some of our earnings measures. We've introduced new non-GAAP measures that exclude non-operating pension costs from our income from continuing operations and corresponding EPS, and we also changed our definition of segment earnings to exclude the non-operating pension costs. We defined non-operating pension costs to include defined benefit plan interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements.  We consider service costs related to active employees to be operating pension costs.","So on the new reporting basis, segment operating earnings were $276 million, down about 5% from $292 million in Q1 last year. General corporate net was $18.5 million compared to $20.2 million in Q1 last year. $18.5 million is a little lower than our expected run rate for the full year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 26.6%. That compares to an adjusted effective rate in Q1 last year of 24.9%. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.23, and that compares to $1.31 a year ago. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.2 million. We repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $88 million, and at the end of Q1, there was $849 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.","Moving to Page 6. This is the graphical version of total company results for Q1. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q1 was 1%. Bills declined sequentially by 11%. As we discussed in last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we entered the first quarter with an unusually low backlog in our solutions businesses. On the right side of the chart, you will note a modest year-over-year and sequential decline in operating earnings. Operating margin in Q1 was 18.5%, down from 19.8% on a comparable basis for Q1 last year. The year-over-year decline is more about an unusually strong margin in Q1 last year than about weakness this year. In Q1 this year, we experienced very modest organic growth so not enough volume leverage to offset a higher base of spending due to annualization of fiscal '12 investments, the increase in operating pension costs of about $5 million in the quarter and normal year-on-year compensation increases. Currency effects also had a negative impact on operating margin in the quarter.  These factors had a similar impact on operating margins in both segments. At 18.5%, operating margin is about equal to last year's full year result, pretty much right on our full year guidance and we believe a very solid start to the year. Although it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 29%.","Now please turn to Page 7. This is the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by 1 point, so 2% organic growth. Sales were down 2% sequentially. Operating margin for the quarter was 27.9%, down from a difficult comp of 29.1% in Q1 last year, but almost a full point above the full year 2012 operating margin for Architecture & Software. Again, a pretty strong start to the year. You can also note here that sequential earnings improvement and operating margin was up 2.7 points sequentially.","The next page, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 1% compared to last year both on a reported and organic basis. There was no significant difference between the year-over-year growth rates and the products portion of this segment and the solutions and services portion. Sales declined 16% sequentially with products down 3%, but solutions and services down 24%. The decline in solutions and services was pretty much as expected, and consistent with our comments last quarter regarding a low beginning backlog. On the right side of this chart, you'll note the year-over-year and sequential earnings decline. Operating margin in this segment dropped from 12.5% in Q1 last year to 11.2% this year.","Particularly in our solutions and services businesses, the cost structure increased over the course of last year as volume ramped. We haven't fully adjusted for the substantial sales decline from Q4 to Q1 because we've rebuilt backlog in Q1, and we need to preserve the experienced people in these businesses to fulfill the orders which now will be delivered in the balance of the year.","Switching to the next page. This provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which displays organic growth. As Keith noted, strong growth in the U.S. of 6%, Latin America was up 7% and Brazil experienced 13% growth in the quarter. EMEA and Canada were each down 2%, and Asia Pacific was down 9% year-over-year with China down 13%. India was weaker. That was somewhat offset by growth in the balance of Asia. Compared to our expectations and looking across the regions, the U.S. outperformed expectations in Q1 and Asia underperformed. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in China and India in his comments. We do expect to see improvement in Asia Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, particularly in China.  Trends in the macro indicators, our backlog at the end of Q1 and input from our sales organization and customers support this view.  In the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain among our best growth opportunities.","I'll turn now to Page 10, which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $156 million. Even though Q1 is typically a weaker cash-flow quarter, that represents about a 97% conversion on net income so another very good start to the year.","And that takes us to the final slide, Page 11, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '13. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.65 billion. That revenue range represents organic growth for the full year between 1% and 5%. Consistent with our previous guidance, we still project stronger growth rates in the second half of the fiscal year. We believe that currency and acquisitions will add about 1 point of additional growth for the full year. That's the same as prior guidance. We continue to expect segment margin to be about 18.7% for the full year, and consistent with an expectation of higher growth rates in the second half, third and fourth quarters are also likely to be the higher-margin quarters.","We are reaffirming adjusted EPS in the range of $5.35 to $5.75. We now foresee a full year adjusted tax rate of between 25% and 26%. That's down slightly from previous guidance of 26%. The reduction is primarily due to the extension of the R&D tax credit for 2012 and 2013 in the recent American Taxpayer Relief Act. We believe that the benefit of a lower tax rate will now likely be offset by somewhat higher share count. Subject primarily to acquisition opportunities, we still expect to spend about $400 million this year on repurchases. However, we are now projecting that full year average shares outstanding will be about 141 million. That's up 1 to 2 million shares from what we expected in November and due to a higher share price and the impact of the higher share price on both repurchases and options. And finally, we still expect general corporate net expense to be about $83 million for the full year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we'll begin Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] Okay, Frances, we're ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you just maybe provide some color on Process in China?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, specifically, Process in China, I think, was -- the impact there was mainly in project delays both -- and really in the backlog where there was a delay in customers because of liquidity, in some cases, delaying shipments. But probably the bigger impact of it was simply the large backlog depletion that we had in the fourth quarter left us with less to be able to ship in the first quarter. So I think that was probably the bigger portion. We saw some additional delays throughout the quarter. I would say the encouraging thing about Process in China was the orders that we had during the quarter where we have rebuilt some of that backlog. So I think it was a quarter -- at this point, we believe it was a quarter phenomenon.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up to that on the backlog build, this -- the CPS solutions business kind of hit -- seemed like it hit instantaneously here with your backlog, that 1.23 book-to-bill, I guess, you're saying through the balance of the year? How much of this comes through in the second quarter?  Because that would imply quite a nice -- just like you had a pretty significant downdraft in the first quarter here would suggest EPS bounces back pretty strongly in the second quarter, yet you're kind of guiding to moderate year-over-year growth, which looks like it doesn't account for that kind of bounceback in the second quarter on revenues.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, Steve, I would say what we believe is that, that buildup in the first quarter doesn't come out immediately the quarter after. So that buildup is why we have confidence in the growth rate in the second half of our year, and it's why we believe the second quarter will be similar to the first quarter. And the buildup, while we're positive about the buildup, it does take a while to work its way through the organization and through the engineering and design process for those projects, and it's a second half phenomenon.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And were these orders late in the quarter? That's my last question, sorry. Were they late in the quarter? Or did they come kind of throughout the quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think they weren't disproportionately weighted to December, but our orders did ramp from October through December in the quarter. Steve, that was pretty much across the board, not unique to solutions.  And just one more comment on solutions. I think we do expect better solutions sales in Q2 than Q1, but we think we'll see more of the impact of that backlog build beyond Q2.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I have a few questions, but I think one thing that's pretty notable is your kind of lack of commitment to share buyback here, and I think the question is kind of it -- maybe it just shows a lack of confidence in the macro environment. But if you look back at kind of the history of your share repurchases, you bought back a lot of stock in 2006 and 2007, and then a bit in 2008, and then it's been kind of a trickle since then. What's really the cause of that? I mean, is it that you just -- the lack of kind of macro confidence to put a lot of money to work here, or do you see some substantial deal out there that's kind of keeping you wanting to be more liquid? I mean, help us kind of understand that -- pretty stark.","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, so Scott, the first thing I would say is even excluding 2007, over the last 3 fiscal years, we've returned $1.3 billion in cash to shareowners either through dividends or share repurchase. And basically, our plan this year is to exhaust our free cash flow, at least that's what we're expecting at the moment to be free cash flow, over the course of this year, and that is the expectation. We talked about us spending $400 million this year after acquisition spending and after dividends. We spent almost 1\/4 of that in the first quarter. So we believe we're on pace for what we were expecting to do in terms of repurchases this year.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, again, and except just to play devil's advocate, I mean, you're holding almost no net debt, and you've got almost $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. I mean, that's a pretty big number. If you go back in history and look, that's a much larger kind of number than the history, and again, if there's some macro uncertainty, I completely understand it, but otherwise -- I guess, I'll move on. We can take this afterwards. I want to go back to Steve's question in China. And talk us through what kind of projects and the volatility there. I mean, my understanding just in talking to your competitors is that China was more flattish for them in the quarter. You, down 13, is probably going to be an outlier for your broader comp group. I mean, what specifically happened to Rockwell that caused that growth rate to modulate down so fast in the quarter [ph]?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, let me -- first, about the flat comment, our orders were flat. So we don't see it as a disconnect from what we had expected in that regard with orders continuing to perform. What happened is -- it's pretty simple. It's the aspect of a solutions business where it's very lumpy, and we have orders and sales that certainly are more volatile than our products businesses and the timing, and in this case, the timing drove a significant shipment in our fourth quarter. That created the hole in our backlog. We had a weak second half orders rate in fiscal '12, and that in combination -- weaker, I should say, a weaker order rate in the second half and that, plus the shipments in the fourth quarter, created the gap in shippable product. And then during the quarter, we had some project delays, and those are typical in a solutions business, and I think it was just a combination of those multiple aspects that created a more severe outcome this quarter in China.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Scott, this is Rondi, and I just want to mention that back in that 2006, 2007 time frame, we sold the power systems business, and that generated net cash flows of over $1 billion. And so when you look at share repurchase from that period of time, that's really an aberration. I think what you're seeing now is very consistent with our cash deployment philosophy that we've been talking about now for years.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, just one quick comment. I just look at -- if you're holding $1 billion in cash and you got $1 billion in receivables, I mean, you essentially have kind of $2 billion of cash to the entity, if you will. I mean, that's just a big number. So I'll pass it on, but that' just my...","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, Scott, that's a fair observation. I think one of the things we've talked about on previous calls is we've got over $1 billion in cash, but 90% of that sits outside the U.S., and we can't easily access that without absorbing a significant tax penalty, which we've been reluctant to do.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, no, I totally get it.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I wondered if you could give any color on sort of different end markets in terms of how customer activity is differing in automotive versus food and beverage, that sort of color.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Absolutely, Julian. Certainly, for us, the 2 strongest end-market verticals for us were automotive and oil and gas, and that would be pretty consistent on a global basis. And if you -- auto outside of EMEA has been strong with continued CapEx investment, and we also are able to now work in another application and will be enabled to participate in more of the powertrain applications in that industry. Oil and gas has been good for a period of time here now and certainly, that was one of the stronger markets for us this past quarter. Consumer in food and beverage, in there, the food is the stronger. Beverage is starting to slow down some, particularly in the mature markets. Most of the CPG consumer investments are being made today more in the emerging markets. Our life sciences business had strength both in EMEA and in Asia Pacific. Tire is getting a little weaker now. They had very strong investments for a couple of years, and I think we're starting to move to a lower investment rate in total, but still good levels of investment. And I would say, today, the weakest markets in total, specific geographies, driven a lot by the reduction in demand from China. So I think that's impacting the mining business in Australia and in certain segments in Latin America as well, although mining in Canada continues to be solid, and then you also know of the labor unrest in South Africa, and that's creating additional, I'll say, impacts on the mining industry.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just secondly, your gross margin was down about 130 -- 120 bps year-on-year even though revenues were up slightly. Was there anything going on, particular input costs or price or any special mix effect, that will normalize?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think, Julian, the only unusual thing is that gross margin is a full GAAP number. So it's got all of the pension cost increase, both operating and non-operating, that we're absorbing year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could we focus in on automotive? It's one of your strongest verticals in legacy. It's one of your most profitable verticals. You have clearly significant model introduction ramps coming in North America. Before we were talking about CapEx, spend improvement should be very helpful to you, GM and so forth. Where are we at with respect to the historical contribution of auto as a vertical? And maybe, Keith, you could give us your perspective around the runway and how you actually see that evolving by, say, geography because, obviously, in prior cycles, China wasn't significant in automotive, and now you're making inroads there. So maybe a little more color there would be helpful.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. Well, you're absolutely right about the legacy strength of automotive in Rockwell Automation. We've talked -- at the depths of the decline, automotive was under -- was in the high single digits. I would say, today, we have -- in -- over the last 2 years, automotive has probably picked up a little bit to where the combination of auto and tire is probably around 15% of our revenue now. Auto is probably a little over 10% to 12%. A lot of that has been because of the growth of the automotive industry outside of the U.S. I mean, the U.S. is back, and it's very important to us, but where the incremental has been from a historical perspective has been the investments, really, in the emerging markets of which China would be #1. And we are continuing to increase our penetration of both the joint venture companies in China, which is the only way a multinational can participate in the automotive market, and in the domestic, the major domestic suppliers. So China has been a great opportunity for us. That would be followed by India, Brazil and Eastern Europe. The only other part that I would -- that I'd link a little bit to the U.S. automotive is Mexico has been a very strong automotive market, and it continues to grow both with North American manufacturers, as well as international companies as well. So Mexico has been an improvement. And then what I mentioned earlier about our ability to address more applications. We now are able to address the powertrain side of the business, and historically, we were mainly in the body and assembly side. And so powertrain -- so we can address -- and paint, so we can address paint, body-in-white assembly, as well as stamping, and now with powertrain, there are no applications that we can't go after in automotive. In addition, we've expanded our information capabilities in MES in the automotive space, and that has been a help for us also in the emerging markets as they try to be a very efficient producer of cars and -- with high quality. So I would say it's really been the emerging market, the expansion of our portfolio that -- and the resurgence of North American manufacturing that has driven our participation in the space to a higher level of our total sales over the last 2 to 3 years.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then in terms of follow-up, could we -- just curious if we could talk a little bit about this China acquisition that you did. I don't believe you've done a China acquisition in the past. Caterpillar, which I realize has nothing to do with your company, just took a massive write-down for a China deal. How have you gotten around -- I mean, you're a pretty cautious guy, how have you gotten around the risks associated with doing that sort of a thing? And is this some sort of an inflection toward your own, I guess, increasing comfort level in China and operating as a player, say, comparable with some of the other big automation players, Mitsubishi and Siemens? I mean, just a little bit, I think -- I just think it's  really interesting. What else can you tell us about it?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, first, it is our second acquisition in China. We acquired an engineering company there for our solutions business, called Hengsheng, and we did that a couple of years back. And that was really to get us domain expertise to have a bigger critical mass of engineers to be able to support our growing solutions business there. So that was more of, I'll say, a people investment, and that has been very successful for us. The second one that we made was basically JCE, which was a medium voltage manufacturer, a medium voltage drives manufacturer. And what gave us a little more confidence here, John, to your question, is the fact that we had worked with them for a number of years previously. They were a contract manufacturer for our medium voltage drive in China, and they had some technology that allowed was -- that allowed us to address a different market segment -- I shouldn't say different market, different applications with a different price point because it was different technology. And it gave us a broader coverage of the medium voltage market, and that's very important because of the energy savings opportunities that, that brings. So I would say the previous working relationship gave us confidence in the people, gave us confidence in their capabilities and certainly was a part of the reason why we made the acquisition. I would say in China, in general, we continue to believe -- well, obviously, it's a very important market, and we continue to look for ongoing acquisitions in China. They are difficult, as you outlined in your comments about Caterpillar, and certainly, we are cautious. We're cautious because of the intellectual property. We're cautious because of the business practices and -- but yet, they're going to continue to grow solid, good companies, and we believe that we want to keep monitoring what's going on in China, and we are willing to make acquisitions there, given the right conditions and situation. But obviously, due diligence is quite important, and we have not proceeded on a number of our acquisition inquiries because of those types of concerns.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Winoker from Sanford and Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Keith, you've often talked about and described Rockwell as not a margin expansion story, but I'd like to just dive into margin a little bit more even on this quarter just to make sure I understand it better in terms of the decrementals. Could you maybe first just talk about the regional mix impact on margin given the very different regional profiles?","Theodore D. Crandall","I don't think there was any -- there was not a significant mix impact in the quarter either based on regional performance or the mix of product versus solutions.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Second then, discretionary spend, and you talked about annualized spending going up year-on-year comp or, I assume, R&D. Maybe just -- and then pricing as well. Just give us a flavor for -- I understand the last year was exceptionally high and that this is the run rate. But try, and if you could, just break it down a little bit into some of those components other than pension that help us get a sense for the profile going forward.","Theodore D. Crandall","Sure, and maybe this will help. One of the reasons Q1 last year was a relatively higher-margin quarter within the context of last year was our spending ramped from Q1 across Q2, 3 and 4 last year. So if you look at the exit rate of spending, we were probably up about 3%, maybe 3.5% from Q1 to Q4, and that carried into our Q1 this year. So with a 1.5% organic sales increase, we've got more like a 3.5% to 4% expense increase, spending increase, if you will, and that includes investments we have made in R&D, in domain expertise, in commercial-facing resources, and included in that also is just normal compensation increases year-over-year, as well as the $5 million increase in operating pension cost we're absorbing.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right. So from your perspective, this wasn't a sort of intra-quarter, it was just you held your cost structure sequentially, and while you're satisfied, it sounds like, with the growth, and better than the Street on growth, that wasn't enough to where you wanted to be, and therefore, your seasonal plan, if I'm correct, is more -- was always weighted later in the year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, yes, we guided to 18.7% for full year and we're 18.5% in the first quarter. So it's not like we're well below.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Douglass from Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Keith, can you talk about the strength in the U.S.? We've heard from some others that there may have been, in some of our channel checks, may have been some pull-forward with companies trying to take advantage of the bonus depreciation, which they weren't sure if it was going to come back or get extended, turned out it was. But was there a little bit of that in the U.S.? And just talk about the strength here in the U.S. and going forward as well.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. Well, as Ted had mentioned, we did see a continual uptick in business throughout the quarter. And every year, there's probably some, whatever you want to call it, budget flushing or pull-ahead that occurs. I think we saw a normal case of that this year, and we did not see anything that I would say was meaningful with respect to taxes or fiscal cliff. Some of our distributors did see a little more sales towards the end of the year. Some of that could be attributed to how you characterized it, but overall, we do not believe there was any meaningful change in what I'll say typical order patterns that we would see towards the -- throughout December and towards the end of December. The strength in the U.S. really comes from automotive and oil and gas. I think those have been the 2 major areas that we've seen. Then, in addition to that, we had a pretty good growth in -- our solutions business grew in the U.S. year-over-year, so that was a positive, and we've had a good Logix sales in the U.S. And I think that was a combination of the solutions growth, and in particular, some of the oil and gas and automotive expenditures that were taking place. So I think that gives a little bit of flavor to it.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then, finally, what are the machine builders in Europe saying about expectations going forward? Not just in Europe, but, obviously, they do a lot of exporting, and they expect -- with a China ramp, are they expecting a better second half in '13 as well, exporting to China?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I'm not sure if they're expecting a better exporting to China. Their exporting has been -- the strength of European exports the last couple of quarters has been the U.S. and Latin America as opposed to China. I think what we're hearing from our European OEMs are they're expecting 2013 to be flat compared to 2012. And I think Italy is still struggling a little, and I think Germany will be the better performer as the year progresses. Their backlogs are probably back to normal. I think they bled off some of their backlogs over the last couple of quarters, and there's a more typical pattern in that at this point in time. And I would say at this point, the only thing we're hearing with respect to weaknesses would be some of the beverage OEMs and to a smaller degree, some packaging, but in general, still a positive outlook for fiscal year '13.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Well, I guess, I understood China was already weak, but are they expecting it to get better as well, like in your forecast?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think the OEMs would say that they do expect to see some pickup as the year progresses, and that would be more towards the end of the calendar year and late our fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the Process growth, so negative this quarter. If I recall from the guidance last quarter, Keith, you talked about Process growth moderating closer to the company average in '13. Is that still intact, so that would imply kind of better growth through the rest of the year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Absolutely right on both comments. We do expect it to be about the company average, and that would require a pickup for us. We expect that based upon some of the backlog build in our solutions business and also some of the continued growth of our products, both the Logix platform, as well as our process safety portfolio. So better second half in Process company average in total for the year.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I assume that incorporates a lift in China as well from what you saw in December?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, absolutely, and matter of fact, in both China and Asia in general, we expect to see that increase.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up is on U.S. So on Mark's question, talking about the growth here in the December quarter, it was pretty solid against a comparison that I wouldn't call easy. The U.S. comparisons get a bit easier. I think the guidance had assumed a low-single-digit-type growth for the U.S. market for '13. You did 6% this quarter. Should we think of this as that being potentially a conservative outlook, now what are the kind of the potholes that you could see in the U.S. right now?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think one of the things we said the last time was that we expect the U.S. to moderate as the year progresses. I think we still feel that, that will be the case. And so, overall, it'll be basically at the company average for the full year. So we do see less than 6% growth, going forward, over the next 3 quarters.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you talk about what Process orders actually did in the quarter overall?","Theodore D. Crandall","Process orders overall were flat on a year-over-year basis.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And so I guess in terms of the pickup from here, is there, I guess, activity beyond that? You're expecting an order pickup in 2Q, or how do you see it playing out?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. We do see order pickup throughout the year in our Process\/solutions businesses.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess, I just mean if it's flat in the quarter, you have visibility into, I guess, activity levels that are not necessarily yet showing up in order levels, right?","Keith D. Nosbusch","That's correct. We believe the activity supports the growth, both the commentary from customers, as well as the commentary from our sales and channel organizations led us to expect a pickup during the year, and it's part of the reasons we talk about the second half being stronger than the first half. We expect second quarter orders to be better in our solutions business, and so the combination of first and second quarter should enable us to see that sales pickup in the second half of our year.","Theodore D. Crandall","And Shannon, just to put it in context, it's flat in Q1, and we're talking about company average 3% growth, organic growth, for the full year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of incremental margins going forward across sort of the remaining quarters of the year, I mean, I know you talked about the second half margins being higher, but any thoughts about where we kind of shake out in terms of ranges on incrementals for the remaining quarters of the year, any timing things or other?","Theodore D. Crandall","I will be honest, I'm trying to think quickly about a sequential incremental margin expectation. I mean, I think, year-over-year, we still have the same incremental margin expectation we talked about in November, which was kind of low 20%. Obviously, we didn't get a great start on that in Q1, but on the other hand, it was a very minor top line change. So we do expect higher absolute margins in Q3, Q4. And primarily based on better volume.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And I mean, last year kind of took a big -- kind of an unusual big sequential step down. I know you had just some timing things last year. I mean, do you have any view on sequential margins coming off 1Q this year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, I think the 2 things that -- we don't do quarterly guidance, but the 2 things I'm comfortable talking about because they're pretty normal each year. One is in January, we do our merit increases for employees pretty much globally. So there is a probably about a $16 million increase in spending related to merit increase from Q1 to Q2. And then secondly, we expect better solutions growth, so we're going to have a little bit less favorable mix in Q2 than Q1. Hopefully, we're going to have some better volume too.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of things. Keith, could you just address, given how we started in APAC, and in particular in China, how does the growth for the year out of that region or country match up against your '13 guidance for core growth?","Keith D. Nosbusch","China, we would expect -- well, Asia Pacific, we would expect to be at the company -- at the flat to at the company average, somewhere in between there in that range, over our range and for all of Asia Pacific. For China, in particular, if that was part of your question, we expect that to be about equal to what last year's growth was in China, which was around 5%.","Theodore D. Crandall","And Rick, I would say compared to our expectations in November, we now expect Asia to be a little bit lower than we were thinking in November, and we expect probably, Latin America, EMEA, U.S. to be a little bit better.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So pretty much all the geographies kind of fall within that 1% to 5% consolidated number. There's nothing above it?","Theodore D. Crandall","No, I will say Latin -- our expectation is Latin America will be above that.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just as a follow-up, we did talk about booking sequentially being better on the solutions side. Is the margin in that backlog and on those bookings, is it consistent with a 25% incremental margin year-over-year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I would say the margin on those bookings is normal solutions margins and generally consistent with our expectation of kind of low-20s conversion incremental margin year-over-year.","Operator","That question will come from the line of Nigel Cole from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I know we've covered a lot of ground with these orders and backlog. But if we go back to last year, I think the book-to-bill was about 1.3. So question is, were the orders year-over-year down? And therefore, is there a risk that as we go into 2Q, we could see a flatten out of sales and maybe even an exit number within CP&S?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, Nigel, I think, to your point, you're right. Last Q1 was a 1.3 book-to-bill. I think the real difference for us this year was in Q4 of '11, we had a pretty good book-to-bill despite having very high solution shipments, and that was with the opposite effect in Q4 of '12. So the hole we created was really in Q4. It's not so much about the book-to-bill in Q1 this year versus Q1 last year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but do you think there's a risk that we could go down from 2% a little bit lower from here before we start to see that inflection upwards?","Theodore D. Crandall","You're saying in terms of organic growth?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","Theodore D. Crandall","I mean, look, even though we don't have great visibility, I would say we're pretty confident in our expectations of solutions and services sales for Q2, and we don't think we're going to see any significant change in our product business trends right now, but there's always a potential range of performance in any one quarter.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Right now, we are expecting second quarter to have similar year-over-year growth, but at the moment, to Ted's point, higher dollar -- higher sales for the quarter.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I mean, we have to get pretty reasonable sequential growth to get to a similar year-over-year growth.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Absolutely, absolutely. No, that's helpful. And then, Ted, you called out the impact of the higher share price on the share count. Is there any impact, though [ph], in the P&L? We have seen some swings with exec [ph] comp growth, last year for example, as the share price fell. So given that you -- I think you planned for the year back in October. Has the higher share price had an impact on some of the -- your margin assumptions for the second half of the year?","Theodore D. Crandall","I don't believe there will be any significant impact because our equity grants all occurred in the first quarter and were valued at the prevailing price at that time, which wasn't that far off our expectations when we did the plan.","Operator","We'll now turn the call back over to Ms. Rohr-Dralle for your closing remarks.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, great, thanks. I think all we want to say is thanks for joining us for today's call. I'm obviously available for all the follow-up calls, and have a great day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, thank you, all, for your participation in today's conference call.

Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter. So please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was another good quarter for us. As we expected, organic growth was up 3.5%. From a vertical perspective, heavy industries performed well and grew above the company average in the quarter, led by growth in oil and gas, mining, metals and semiconductor. Consumer grew above the company average as well. Transportation declined in Q2 on tough year-over-year comps. Through the first half of the year, automotive was down a little more than 5%. Sequentially, our global automotive business was up in Q2. Revenue associated with Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from the Connected Enterprise once again grew double-digits.","From a regional perspective, growth was again fairly broad based. The U.S., our largest market, grew 3.6% organically. We saw a good growth in heavy industries partially offset by softness in automotive. Oil and gas grew double-digits in the U.S. for the second quarter in a row. EMEA was down about 1% in the quarter. Asia grew about 4%. China sales were up in line with the company average. China had very strong orders performance in Q2. Latin America was up over 15% led by strength in Mexico and Brazil.","I'll make a few additional comments about our performance. Logix was up 5% organically in Q2 compared to last year, including strong growth in CompactLogix, which has grown double-digits six quarters in a row. Our Process business delivered another good quarter and was up about 9% year-over-year.","We are pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was up 22% and free cash flow was very strong. In the first half of the fiscal year, organic sales grew 4.4%, adjusted EPS grew 17%, segment operating margins were up 150 basis points year-over-year and free cash flow conversion was 108%. This is very good financial performance for the first half of the year. Patrick will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance in his remarks.","I want to spend a minute talking about our investment and capital deployment priorities. Our first priority is to invest in our business to drive organic growth. In January, we described the types of investments we would be making to accelerate profitable growth and increased long-term differentiation. We're ramping up a number of these investments. For example, software development and commercial resources to fuel the growth of our Information Solutions and Connective Services offerings, accelerated investments to expand our Process capabilities, a new electric vehicle center of excellence to be co-located with one of our software development teams based in San Jose, California, and investments in facilities as well as technology, training and benefits to enhance employee engagement globally.","On the topic of capital deployment, I'm pleased to report that this morning we announced a 10% dividend increase. This is the second increase in the last 12 months. This increase reflects our confidence in the Connected Enterprise strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable cash generation.","Let's move on now to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018. The global manufacturing environment remains favorable and macroeconomic indicators are positive. We believe that we are in the early stages of a manufacturing expansion cycle and we will benefit from the very broad array of industries that we serve. Our customers are focused on driving productivity in their operations, which quite simply is our mission.","Turning to guidance. We continue to expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance and expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion. Consistent with our January guidance, we expect that heavy industries will be the largest growth driver followed by consumer. Transportation will be flat to down a little for the fiscal year. Taking into account our strong first half results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.70 to $8. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few closing comments. As I mentioned before, we grew double-digits in Information Solutions and Connected Services in Q2. On Monday of this week, we announced significantly enhanced capabilities in our FactoryTalk analytics platform. This is software that turns production data into actionable information that drives productivity, a sizable part of the investments that I mentioned earlier are targeted in this space.","This offering is enhanced by a very strong network of partners. We are expanding our Academy of Advanced Manufacturing, which is training veterans for smart manufacturing jobs. The second class graduated this week and graduates are going to work at manufacturers throughout the U.S. For example, five of these veterans will be starting work at an electric vehicle startup in Illinois.","I also want to highlight an important recognition we received this quarter. As you have heard me say many times, the dedication of our employees, partners and suppliers makes a different set of customers and is the key to our success. It's not only what they do, but how they do it that helps drive business results and value for our stakeholders. That's why I was so pleased when we, for the 10th time, received the Ethisphere Award naming Rockwell Automation as one of the world's most ethical companies. This recognition is a testament to our strong culture of integrity.","With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the second quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a solid quarter of the fiscal year with reported sales up 6.2%, organic growth was in line with our expectations at 3.5%, currency translation contributed 3.9 points of sales growth and the fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.2 points. Segment operating margin was 20.9%, up 190 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth, good productivity performance and lower incentive compensation was partly offset by higher investment spending.","General corporate net expense of $18 million was down $3 million compared to last year. That's normal variability and timing of corporate costs. Adjusted EPS of $1.89 was up $0.34 compared to the second quarter of last year, an increase of 22%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of strong operating performance. Free cash flow was very strong in the quarter, $359 million or 148% of adjusted income.","A few additional items to cover, not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 128.5 million, down 1.8 million from last year. We repurchased two-and-a-half million shares in the quarter at a cost of $465 million. Through March 31st, we are a little ahead of pace to get to the $1.2 billion full year target we shared with you last quarter. At March 31st, we had $935 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And finally, our second quarter fiscal 2018 GAAP results reflect an $11.5 million adjustment to the provisional tax charges that we took in our first quarter related to the Tax Act. As I mentioned on the call last quarter, we are excluding tax charges related to the Tax Act from adjusted EPS.","Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had about 7% sales growth. Organic sales were up 2.5% year-over-year and currency translation increased sales by 4.4%. You will recall that last year, this segment had an exceptional second quarter with about 14% organic sales growth, so certainly a tough quarter to lap. For the quarter, segment margin expanded 190 basis points year-over-year to 28.4%. Margin tailwind from higher sales, good productivity and lower incentive compensation was partially offset by higher investment spending.","Moving on to slide 6, Control Products & Solutions, reported sales were up 5.7% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 4.4%. Currency translation contributed 3.6% and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.3%. Organic growth in our solutions and services businesses in this segment came in at 6%. Growth in the product businesses in this segment was similar to the Architecture & Software segment growth on an organic basis. Operating margin for this segment increased 180 basis points compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to higher sales, good productivity and lower incentive compensation expense; another quarter of good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services business in this segment was 1.08 in Q2 following an exceptionally strong 1.2 in Q1 and 1.17 a year ago.","The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks. So I will just point out that for Q2, emerging markets organic growth was up about 7% and for the first half of fiscal 2018 we saw broad-based growth across all regions.","Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of comments about the recently announced tariffs, some of which have little to no impact on our business and some of which we're still reviewing. With regards to Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum enacted in March 2018, we do not buy large quantities of commodities including steel or aluminum. While we have seen increases in the price of steel and aluminum in anticipation of these tariffs, the impact of these tariffs on our input costs is immaterial to our overall results. Similarly, the tariffs implemented by China in early April do not impact our products.","The other group of tariffs relate to certain goods imported into the U.S. from China that have been proposed by the U.S. following the Section 301 investigation as well as the additional tariffs that China has proposed on U.S. goods imported into China. As you know, these tariffs have not been enacted yet and there remains a lot of uncertainty about the particulars of what may be implemented including any exemptions. We're analyzing the potential implications to our business including opportunities that may be available to mitigate impacts of these tariffs, should they get enacted. Given the fluid nature of the matter, however, it is too soon to discuss any specifics.","This takes us to slide 8, the guidance. We continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion with organic sales growth within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. Our assumptions for currency remain largely the same. We continue to expect the tailwind from currency translation to be about 2% and the sale of the business in fiscal 2017 of course will remain about a 1 point headwind to sales. Our organic growth guidance of about 5% of the midpoint implies that the organic growth in the second half of fiscal 2018 will be about 5.5% compared to 4.4% organic growth in the first half of fiscal 2018. The expected increase of organic growth in the second half compared to the first half of the fiscal year is driven by higher expected growth rates in our solutions and services businesses, and to a much lesser extent, by higher backlogs in our product businesses at the end of Q2.","We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. First half segment margin was a bit above that and as we increased investments, we expect segment margin in the second half to be about 21%. This implies full year core earnings conversion of about 35%, consistent with our November and January guidance. General corporate net expense is expected to be between $75 million and $80 million for the full year. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 20.5%. 0.5 point lower than our January guidance. We continue to target about $1.2 billion in share repurchases for fiscal 2018 and now expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about $127.5 million for fiscal 2018.","We are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.70 to $8. At the midpoint, this is a $0.10 increase compared to our January guidance. This reflects our strong first half performance and the favorable tax rate and share count compared to our January guidance. At the midpoint, this represents 16% year-over-year EPS growth on 6% higher reported sales, primarily due to strong operating performance. And finally, we now expect free cash flow conversion for fiscal 2018 to be about 105%.","In summary, we had another solid quarter and we expect fiscal 2018 to be another year of good financial performance for us.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.","Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Blake, on auto, so flat to down a bit here in the first half, expect flat for the year, flat to slightly down for overall transportation. What kind of visibility are you starting to build for 2019? It looks like from a launch standpoint at least in North America, a number of launches for the Detroit based manufacturers goes up pretty significantly in calendar 2019. So just wanted to get your thoughts on when you would start to see some of the revenue benefit from that?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think the outlook for 2019, for both traditional automotive as well as electric vehicle, continues to look positive. So we saw a return to MRO spend in the traditional business in Q2. We had mentioned some comments of concerns at the end of Q1, and we saw those more traditional levels restored. And then from some of the commitments that we've received in the quarter, 2019 is shaping up to be generally positive for us.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And would that apply both to tire and auto, or how would you...?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","There's been some good activity in tire as well. If we talk about North America, I would say, the particular area of activity for 2019 has been in the electric vehicles side, in terms of new commitments and that's really around the world. We've seen some important projects that we've been named on in China as well as in the U.S.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on Europe, so down and look like project timing, how should we think about kind of cadence of organic growth here for the next couple of quarters, face some tougher comparisons in the second half, anything, I guess maybe Patrick, you could help on with regards to cadence of organic growth?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Rich, is that specific to Europe or just in general?","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, in general and then just a comment on Europe would be helpful.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start with Europe. So Europe was down about 1 point in the second quarter, and obviously, we had a tough comp in Europe. Europe was up about 12% last year and what we see is the timing of some of the projects that create some noise. With respect to timing of organic growth for the balance of the year for the whole company, we think that the year-over-year growth will be somewhat similar in Q3 and in Q4, maybe little bit more weighted in the fourth quarter of the year, but I don't expect big differences in overall growth rates Q3 versus Q4, maybe a little overweighed in Q4.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, Rich, if I can add as well. We did see some moderate sequential growth through the quarter, and then from Q1 to Q2 as we mentioned, the automotive shipments did see sequential growth.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you talk about the competitive environment a bit. There's been some \u2013 obviously ABB kind of moved in and stoked up their discrete presence. Are you seeing anything there globally where there were B&R or some of the smaller guys are becoming more effective; any change there?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Not really. I mean as we've talked about before, B&R was a good competitor when they were independent. ABB will be continue to be a strong competitor with B&R, but we're not seeing any wholesale change in terms of the competitive environment based on the combination.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then I guess with the start to the year, I mean to get to high end of the range it seems like you need a pretty significant pickup in the second half. How should we about that? I mean was there any thought to kind of taking off the high end of the range on sales given the start to the year even though the EPS moves up obviously because of better margins and little bit of tax. It just seems like that's \u2013 or is that what you're seeing in your business. You still think there's a shot at getting to that high end of the range?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","As the mix is biasing towards heavy industries, heavy industries has greater exposure to projects and those are going to come in in a more lumpy fashion. We've seen good book-to-bill over the last couple of quarters. If we see some projects large for us, that could come any time. And so when those projects come and when we start to recognize revenue from those projects, could have a significant impact on the end of the year. So that's why we have that baked into the high-end of that range.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One last one. What is your auto guidance for the year on growth, organic, for auto global?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Flat to slightly down, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the detail.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just back a little bit, maybe a different take on kind of the competitive environment question. Obviously, you've invested a fair amount in Connected Enterprise, and you'd mentioned a couple of things today, but I wonder if you \u2013 just kind of re-evaluating the landscape, you know the approach of kind of us and our friends are, are you leaving too much of your growth upside to your friends and partners? Do you need to tweak what you're doing or how you're doing? I'm sure this is an evolutionary process, something you don't wake up in the morning and say, yeah, we need to shift gears, but is there, Blake, any evolution in your thinking on how to competitively address the market?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Jeff, I think it's a good question and I think evolution is the way to look at it in that. We're constantly evaluating given the pace of the technology changes, what we need to do, what is core to us versus what we can provide a more robust solution to our customers by partnering and obviously acquisitions are a part of that as well. So things that maybe 10 years ago we thought would be something best left to partners or things that we might be looking at more as a part of what our core capabilities need to be going forward in terms of technology as well as expertise. And so we're constantly looking at that.","What that doesn't mean is that we think we need to have a single monolithic closed approach to having every application that our customers might need and every bit of expertise because we don't think anybody is going to have best-in-brand top to bottom there. So to be able to provide the best solution, to provide an open framework for our customers to be able to accommodate existing installed base as well as what they might need in the future to take advantage of small nimble companies that have good ideas that can fit into our framework, that's still very much a part of our strategy but we're constantly evaluating what we need to own versus what we need to partner with and those partners again are going to be a combination of big well-known names like Microsoft as well as smaller companies that have good ideas that can fit into our system and can take advantage of our market access.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Will it follow from that that the size of your M&A would increase though, that you have a small vertical bolt-on even I'd put MAVERICK in that category, right gives you chemical, is that still the game plan or do you think the size of what you need to do or want to do is increasing?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I'd say if you look at our funnel, it's increased both in terms of the range including some larger, larger acquisitions than we might have thought about before as well as the number and in particular our focus areas. So we talked about our priorities for acquisition, the Information Solutions, Connected Services, increasing access in some of the emerging markets. We're looking first at the strategic fit and then we're looking at the financial impact and we're very active in that area of the company.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Line is open.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Blake, you made a comment, just said in your prepared remarks that we're in the early stages of the manufacturing cycle. How is this playing out? I mean, based on your experience at least, things seem a little bit weird or a little bit slow for this time in the cycle, meaning I know auto will probably hurt you 100 basis points or so, but even if you back that out growth maybe 4.5%, doesn't really feel like an up cycle in a traditional way. And I think as Steve Tusa noted, you need to pick up in the back half of the year to hit your growth numbers. So my question really is, do you see it in your order books in a real way, in your customer commentary that this indeed is an up cycle or are your comments more based on macro data?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think there's a combination of factors that we triangulate to arrive at that outlook. First of all, our business, over a long period of time ever since I've been in business, is correlated to industrial production. And obviously industrial production forecasts will change when you get to the actuals, but if you look at the actual IP over decades, it's correlated pretty well to our growth where our growth is a multiple of that.","IP, particularly in the U.S. is that the highest rate that it's been at in years. Now, the mix by vertical is certainly changing. There's no question that auto has moderated from what growth rates we saw last year, but again we're seeing a positive program commits, as the industry transforms to one that's more weighted to EV, then it's going to be volatile. And everybody starting from a small base so run rates and growth quarter-to-quarter is going to be less meaningful than in a mature business. So from a macro standpoint, we see positive signs.","In terms of our order book and our backlog, Patrick mentioned before, we had a historically high book-to-bill in Q1. We had good book-to-bill in this quarter. We're chasing projects, we think that are very reasonable, that are good fits for our capabilities, but the mix is changing. And so you're going to see more on the heavy industry side, amidst the fundamentals of consumer and then I've talked before about transportation.","From a regional standpoint, emerging markets, high-single-digits, we still see that, that piece is playing out as the growth of the middle class creates demand for things that we're good at helping manufacturers produce, consumer, automotive and then there's obviously semiconductor and other heavy industries that are strengthening. So from a variety of directions, that gives us confidence that we are in the early stages, but I agree with you Scott about the weirdness of this. I mean capital with our customers has still remained on the sidelines compared to some of the historic ratios. And where we think that our fundamental mission of helping them increase productivity whether they have in their minds large capital projects or not, we're still in our wheelhouse to be able to help them be able to save money and time.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Yeah. Makes sense. And then just as a follow-up and it doesn't need to be a long follow-up, but electric vehicles from what you sell, particularly given that you're not huge in the drive train historically. I mean, they don't seem to be that different from a Rockwell perspective. So, what do you think requires you to kind of separate out in a center of excellence and plop yourself in the middle of kind of the action, if you will. And do you think it really is a different market for you that you need to approach differently in some way shape or form, or is this just a way to showcase your capabilities a little bit closer to maybe some of the upstarts or startups, et cetera?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","You know, Scott, a lot of the manufacturing processes are the same. I mean assembly, paint, trim and chassis, those are very similar. Whether it's traditional automotive or it's EV, obviously you have the battery, fabrication, the winding that's different. I think what prompts us to create a center of excellence is the nature of the companies. These are startup companies. And while a lot of them have veterans that they've poached away from traditional manufacturers, these are smaller companies and they know that they have to differentiate not only in their technology, but in their business models. And to be able to embed ourselves in that flow of ideas is a big part of what prompted us to open this center of our excellence.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Very fair. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, and good morning all. Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on the \u2013 given the Process and other growth and heavy industry growth you're talking about versus auto, et cetera, can you maybe just once again quantify the impact of that as you're looking into the second half on margin, just the margin mix impact of the relative vertical growth?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Steve, your second half compared to the first half or second half?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. So in other words, just as Process continues to outgrow the other areas in heavy industry, my understanding is that that profit weighs a little bit more there and I know you've got solutions and services picking up. So just looking for kind of the margin mix impact of the various growth rates within the segment, sort of all rolled up.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","For the back half of the year, you can think, it might be a few tenths of a point negative from the overall company perspective.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","As we've modeled out longer-term the growth process to be sure it has additional labor content in it which is going to be a little less margin rich. On the other hand, when those customers are buying hardware and then they're doing the integration or the VARs are doing the integration into complete solutions, it tends to use a lot of large processors. And so the margin contribution of that when it's sold as products is actually pretty good. So we see, as Patrick said, some dilution if the mix were to change completely over, but there's some puts and takes there.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. And Steve to Blake's point, it's one of the reasons that within the Architecture & Software segment which was up 2.5% in the quarter, Logix did actually much better than that. It was up about 5%, because it has a much better exposure across industries including heavy industries.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then as a second topic on the follow-up. Just getting back to kind of your overall kind of capital deployment, you mentioned the second dividend increase in the last 12 months, but still sitting on that cash, still obviously a lot overseas, but tax changes, you talked with Jeff about increasing M&A to some extent, but I would still \u2013 even if it's number and size of deals, I would make the assumption, it's not outside kind of the long-term Rockwell capital deployment approach. So what can you do or maybe if not feel a need to, but to maybe take up capital deployment especially, if you feel like we're at the early stages of an industrial expansion?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think Steve, a couple of things. One, Blake mentioned that in the pipeline, we have larger type deals than what we have done in the past. We have \u2013 in terms of capital deployments in January we did increase substantially the target per share repurchases for this year from $500 million to $1.2 billion and as we just announced today, we're increasing the dividend. And so, I think it's fair to say that we've already significantly increased the amount of capital we're deploying.","We've already said that if there is tax reform, we have access to the excess non-U.S. cash, then we would redeploy that over a period of 18 months to 24 months. And I think that we're in the process of doing so. And we want to be careful because if we see an attractive opportunity to deploy capital, we want to keep all the flexibility and doing the share repurchase over a period of time provides us that flexibility.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. We still remain primarily an organic growth story. We think that the Connected Enterprise value proposition which really brings strengths from all parts of the company together remains as vibrant as ever, but we're going to use all of our strengths and some of that is going to be our strong financial position as well.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. But it sounds like based on those numbers that you wouldn't be surprised in a year from now certainly to just be well within a kind of you know normal net debt position from here given all of that?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think over a period of say 18 months to 24 months that is not unreasonable.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great thanks. I'll hand it off.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you and good morning. I just wanted to circle back to this notion that you're sort of ramping up investments because I guess the SG&A is down year-on-year in Q2. Your CapEx I think in the first half is down high-teens year-on-year and your incremental margins moved up a bunch in Q2 even with the top-line slowing. So I realize there's a lot of moving parts in each of those buckets, but could you maybe quantify it all, how much let's say R&D is going up or what kind of higher investment spend in dollars you're referring to?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So Julian you mentioned SG&A. When we talk investments, a lot of our investments go towards research and development. Our R&D expenses are not part of SG&A. They sit in gross profit. And if you look at our at our gross profit performance, you see that there's not been a big change there in the gross profit margin and one of the reasons is, is that our R&D spending has actually gone up in that area.","From an overall spend point of view, you may have heard us talk in the past about a $2 billion-ish base of overhead spending. For the full year, we're targeting about a 3.5% increase, which is about $70 million. We've seen a $70 million increase year-over-year. Of that $70 million, we've seen about a third in the first half of the year and so the other two-thirds we projected that's included in our guidance will happen in the back half of the year.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And then my follow-up, I guess, would be around what you're seeing in China. A bunch of your discrete automation peers, I think, had really high growth numbers there in the March quarter. You all have slowed down, I think, despite an easier comp. So maybe just talk a little bit about what you saw there in revenues and then also orders. Is that where some of those large projects that you think may hit your P&L in the second half coming in, is it in China? Maybe just some color on that market.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Some of those big projects are in fact in China. So, in Q2 the growth that we saw was driven by a diverse range of industries that included consumer, semiconductor, water treatment, chemical, metals. So it was across the spectrum. I would say maybe the most important story in China was the very strong order development there and that included projects as well as flow business. A couple of examples that we can talk about is a particular electric vehicle manufacturer gave us a pair of multimillion dollar orders; one for their Chinese operations, one for new facility in the U.S. with our MES software. So this fits squarely in that new value from the Connected Enterprise and our software orders that obviously have associated maintenance and support along with that and that really differentiates us from some of those other discrete suppliers in the industry that we can link the real-time control hardware with the information software and services that helps them get even greater productivity. There's some other projects that we're chasing in heavy industries in China and so, I would characterize the outlook of our people in China as quite positive and again it's across a variety of industries.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. And so in China, you think you should grow what's slightly above the company average this year then?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. A little below 10% for the full year.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hey, good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So heavy industries as you know a lot of different end markets within heavy industries. Would you say what gives you confidence in the second half pickup in organic growth that you talked about? Is that you're seeing broad-based growth in heavy industries, whether it's oil and gas, semicon, mining? Maybe you could give us a little bit more color on different markets within heavy industries, and if any of those markets are actually picking up, as we speak?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. Andy, in my comments, I referred to the higher growth second half versus the first half of the year. And I referred to higher growth rates particularly in our solutions and services businesses. One of the reasons why we have a good level of comfort with that is that a lot of that already sits in our backlog at the end of March. As you know our solutions and services businesses tend to run at about a six months backlog and so we have a little bit more visibility in those businesses for the back half of the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful. And then, obviously there is some concern regarding short cycle growth momentum slowing down. So, maybe Blake or Patrick, you could tell us what your distributors are telling you. Have they seen any slowdown in orders with the cadence of the month within the quarter. Did you see generally steady growth. Are they doing any sort of destocking, any color you can provide would be helpful.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think the feedback from the distributors matching what we're seeing in our results is general sequential improvement through the quarter.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And looking for another good year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Easy enough guys. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye, your line is open. Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much. Thanks very much. Good morning. And a nice performance on the operating line. At the same time, we had FX as a pretty significant contributor to revenue. So I was wondering what the impact to margins was from FX. Was it dilutive, accretive, how to think about that?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It had no impact on segment margins, Noah. It had an EPS benefit, but it had no impact on segment margin in the quarter versus prior year.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Okay. So that's pure operational improvement. Great. And then you know I think you've been asked about the M&A pipeline a couple of different ways, but I guess we would just like to understand. What is sort of a reasonable expectation for full year acquisition spending amount. Obviously, a little bit like to start the year, but you commented to a very healthy and expanding pipeline.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. We targeted in our overall sources of revenue growth, 1 point or more a year from acquisitions. And then obviously, as I mentioned, it's going to be predicated first on the strategic fit, and then we'd look at the financial impact. So over a period of time, 1 point or more of growth. You'll see some years that might be less than that. You'll see other years that will be considerably more as we move forward, but it's an active pipeline. I've talked about the diversity of what's in that pipeline. There's also diversity in terms of what's getting close and what's a little bit further out. So you have now near and far planning out, and that's what we want. We want to charge that pipe so that there's a steady stream of opportunities that are maturing going forward.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, my first question. I know it's not a huge end market for you, electronics, but I'd be curious to hear any commentary that you have on just intra-quarter what you're seeing on trends. It's been an end market that some other folks have flagged as being pretty choppy. So I'm curious to hear your commentary there.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Well, starting with the headline; we expect double-digit growth in semiconductor for the year. They're investing a lot. We have a good solution there, particularly when you look at the software, that's being used for overall supervisory control, building management type of applications. It's been big for a long time in Asia and some of the orders we saw in China were associated with the semiconductor facilities in the last quarter, but the impact is beyond Asia as well. And so we're seeing Europe, for instance, having contribution from semicon as well. It's about 5% of our business, but at those growth rates, I look at it as somewhat similar to life sciences. And that when you have those large growth rates, they can have an impact on our overall results and we have some highly differentiated solutions there.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. That makes sense, Blake. Maybe following on, one for Patrick. Just in thinking about the repatriation timing, Patrick maybe you can give us an update on what you're seeing on being able to repatriate the cash that's abroad and should we be thinking about roughly a $2 billion number that will ultimately come back to the U.S.? Any color there would be helpful.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. So far this year we have repatriated about $900 million of cash. That's why you see a reduction in our short-term debt and of course some of that we've redeployed through share repurchases. By the end of this fiscal year \u2013 or no, later than the end of this fiscal year, we expect our short-term debt to be close or at zero. The $2.4 billion of excess non-U.S. cash is going to take us, what we said in January, a little bit over a year to bring it all back home. And so some of it will take us into early 2019. And as I said earlier on the call, our expectation is to redeploy it over an 18 months to 24 months period because it provides us a lot of flexibility to do it over the period of time.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got you. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Your line is open.","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Tristan in for Joe. Thanks for taking the question. I personally believe that it's difficult to identify historic changes if you live through them. So with that in mind, how do you know \u2013 how will we know when Industrie 4.0 evolution is complete? Would be interested in your take on that.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I would say for Industrie 4.0 or a customer's journey to their Connected Enterprise, China Manufacturing 2025, all these different terms for integrating control on information. Important principle to keep in mind is that a customer is never done with that. They all embark on that journey at different stages of maturity. So some still needed to put basic automation building blocks in place or update decades old technology. Others have that fundamental real-time control on information and they're looking to integrate additional productivity tools in their enterprise, but wherever they start, that journey doesn't end. There's low-hanging fruit to be sure. I mean we see when we're providing for instance remote monitoring for customers that they can reduce unplanned downtime by as much as 50%, others have more modest goals. So they might be around more rapid startup and so on, but you're never done.","Now, looking at the maturity and how it impacts our results in terms of those concepts, we are seeing the move that we talked about before as we go from pilots to more enterprise customer engagement. So people have tried, let's say, pilots. They've gotten confidence that they can save money with some of these concepts and they're moving it out to larger deployments. And so we're seeing the number of customers that are looking at multi-site rollouts of these technologies and services increasing.","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then if I can follow-up on this and your investment in The Hive, what do you think is the biggest barrier to manufacturers adopting AI?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So well in terms of taking advantage of AI, I think because manufacturing is largely installed base, very few manufacturers have the luxury of starting with a clean sheet of paper. So they're dealing with older technology that's running their facilities and as they upgrade, they have opportunities to implement new, new techniques. I think that another challenge is the way that the effective use of artificial intelligence spans multiple organizational silos within a company. So you have the expertise on the plant floor that knows how the operation should run, it knows the traditional sources of downtime and lost productivity in those operations and then you have the IT world that understands these new tools. And being able to bridge that world to converge IT and OT is really the biggest opportunity for these companies to take advantage of both the technology as well as the expertise. One is not effective without the other.","Tristan Margot - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Your line is open.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, two questions. First just maybe you can talk a little bit about your regional sales. I mean obviously the organic growth in LATAM was strong and off at a reasonable base. But, could you talk about like areas where you're probably getting some share gain versus some share challenge? And maybe you can overlay it with a comment about the Logix growth rate?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So we see in general a continued path to share gains in our core products and we've talked about products like Logix and our View, Stratix network switches, Kinetix Motion Control and PowerFlex drives, those have been on a pretty steady upward tick in terms of the shares we triangulate what we report, what our competitors report, what the industry reporting companies tell us. While we watch that fluctuations on a quarterly basis, obviously share is fairly volatile in that respect. It's also a lagging indicator. So you don't get a real good information in the real-time, but we think our share is improving. When we see the kinds of growth that we're seeing in places like Latin America, we think there's no question that we're taking share. Indicators tell us that we're continuing to notch up the share in the U.S. So we feel comfortable that what we are selling and the market access is differentiated.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And there's a follow-up. I just want to kind of turn kind of the excellent capital allocation questions up to 11% here. I mean you've got a pretty significant market break in your stock. You've turned down a pretty material bid, higher from another company. You have a view of what your peak earnings could be and what your stock is worth and that at these prices given the market break, it could be 40% to 50% higher. Why wouldn't you consider being more aggressive deployment of capital on an accelerated basis to maybe buy back 10% of the company?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So Rob, we're going to see fluctuations over near-term in the stock price, but I'll go back some of the comments from last fall that remain true today, a few months later. First of all, our strategy is working. The Connected Enterprise strategy and bringing that to life for customers is bringing them value and we're seeing growth from that.","Second, as you point out, we do have the strength to use our balance sheet to create additional value for shareholders, and as Patrick said, there's a variety of ways that we can do that. Our first priority is around improving the long-term differentiation of the company and to support the organic growth. We have an active acquisition pipeline and we do expect to use more of our capital than we have in the past in that respect. And then we've already increased the share repurchase. We just increased the dividend today and so we do intend to do that, but we're not going to lurk into a new strategy because the strategy is working and we're bringing long-term value. And we think that's borne out by the superior value creation that we've provided over a variety of past looking measures. Thanks a lot.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time. All right. Thank you.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. That concludes today's call.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thank you, Tuwanda. Good morning. Thanks, everyone, who's joined us for this call this morning. This is our fourth quarter fiscal 2013 earnings release conference call. With me today, as always, are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that includes highlights on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year, and he'll provide some context around our sales outlook for fiscal '14. Then Ted will provide more details on the results, as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about an hour today.","Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with highlights of the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck. We have a strong end to the year with both sales and earnings coming in at the high end of July guidance. Organic growth of 3% in the quarter was driven by strong growth of over 6% in our product businesses, which drove us to the high end of our sales guidance.","As expected, we had a small decline in solutions and services in the quarter due to the tough comparison to the fourth quarter of last year. Even with that, Control Products & Solutions reached their first $1 billion sales quarter, and I'd like to congratulate them on achieving this milestone.","Profitability was very strong in the quarter with adjusted earnings per share growth of 14%. That's a very good result on only 3% sales growth. Ted will provide more details on the quarter, so I'll move on to the full year.","As we entered fiscal '13, growth rates have been declining, project delays were increasing and our solutions backlog was relatively low. We characterized the recovery as being in a pause and indicated that we didn't expect to see much growth until the second half of the fiscal year. That is the way the year played out. Sales in the first half were flat, but improved to 3.5% growth in the second half.","From a regional perspective, Latin America had an outstanding year of 12% sales growth with the highest growth in Mexico and Brazil. We're focusing on the right opportunities there, and I want to acknowledge the regional team for hitting it out of the park this year. The U.S. had very solid growth with 4% growth. Oil and gas was the best performing vertical. The EMEA region had flat sales this year, but we continued to outperform the market, especially with OEMs. It feels like Western Europe has stabilized. Asia Pacific had a challenging year with sales declines in all countries, except for Japan. India was very weak, and we aren't sure if we've seen the bottom yet. However, we did see some positive signs in Asia Pacific as we exited the year. China sales were down 5% for the year, but there was growth in the second half. In total, this region had the strongest sequential sales growth in both Q3 and Q4 and ended the year with backlog 15% higher than a year ago.","It's not on the chart, but our process sales were flat this year compared to 20% growth last year. We knew 2013 would be somewhat of a struggle given the hole we had in the solutions backlog entering the year. Solutions and services is 60% of what we measure as our process business, and the projects tend to be larger so there can be lumpiness to the sales patterns. While we're not satisfied with flat process sales, we think we've held our own in tough market conditions and expect significantly better growth in fiscal '14. We continue to be very bullish on our process opportunities.","To further expand our process capabilities, we recently announced our intention to acquire vMonitor, a global technology leader for wireless solutions in the oil and gas industry. vMonitor offers innovative monitoring and control solutions for wellhead and upstream applications to help customers make more informed decisions and improve production. With differentiated solutions and a strong presence in the Middle East, vMonitor is really in the sweet spot of our acquisition strategy. We expect the acquisition to close within the next month.","Let me just wrap up on the year before I move on to the outlook. Fiscal '13 was another year of record sales and earnings for the company. I was pleased that in a low-growth environment, we were able to expand segment operating margin almost 1 point while continuing to invest for growth. I am proud of our ability to effectively execute in all market conditions.","Our strong track record of returning cash to share owners continued in fiscal 2013. We paid out $679 million in dividends and share repurchases. As you probably saw, we raised the dividend yesterday, which is the second increase in the past 7 months. We have doubled our dividend per share in the last 4 years, and during the same timeframe, we have returned $2 billion of cash to share owners. I want to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their dedication and relentless customer focus throughout the year that enabled this performance.","So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2014. From a macroeconomic perspective, forecasts with GDP and industrial production are about the same as they were a quarter ago and they continue to call for higher growth rates in 2014. Almost all of the PMIs are higher than they were a quarter ago, so that's encouraging. From a company perspective, a stable front-log, second half fiscal '13 growth rates and a higher solutions backlog entering the year all caused us to expect higher year-over-year growth in fiscal '14 than we saw last year. By region, we expect the U.S. to have about the same growth rates as 2013 and Europe to be a little better than last year. We expect Asia Pacific to return to growth next year, but growth in Latin America will likely moderate, coming off of very strong year. With all that said, we expect total company organic sales growth of 2% to 6% next year. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Automation remains a great market, and we have the right strategy to capitalize on growth opportunities and gain share. Our strong operating performance and healthy balance sheet enable us to continue to invest in differentiation, particularly in innovative technology and domain expertise. We're confident that our focus on intellectual capital will continue to fuel attractive returns for our share owners.","Before I hand it to Ted, I'd like to give you a little preview of Automation Fair. For those of you who haven't been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host over 8,000 customers and partners from all over the world. It's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capabilities, provide technical training and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. It's taking place in Houston this year and will have an emphasis on oil and gas, probably the best vertical out there right now.","If you're coming to Houston next Thursday, you'll hear from John McDermott, the leader of our Global Sales and Marketing team; Terry Gebert, the Head of our Global Systems & Solutions business; and from one of our major oil and gas customers. Then we'll take you on a hosted tour of the show floor. After lunch, we'll hold a webcast where you will learn more about our strategy and progress from me, Ted and Frank Kulaszewicz and Blake Moret, the heads of our 2 segments.","I was recently at Cisco's World Forum, where we introduced some concepts about the relevance of the Internet of Things to the industrial environment. We're anxious to share more of our thinking on that topic with you next week. Rondi tells me that the attendance will be very good. So we're pleased that so many of you are taking advantage of this opportunity, and we look forward to seeing you there.","So now, I'll turn it over to Ted to provide more details on the financial results with the quarter and our outlook for fiscal '14. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'll be starting with the fourth quarter results summary on Page 5. Sales in the quarter were $1,716,000,000, an increase of 3% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was also 3%. Segment operating earnings were $358 million, an increase of 18% compared to the fourth quarter last year. We had a couple of large unusual items impact both segment earnings and general corporate net expense in the quarter. I'll provide more detail on segment earnings on the next slide.","General corporate net was $39.7 million in Q4 compared to $19.9 million a year ago. That's obviously much higher than our normal run rate, and it's about $14 million higher than the guidance we discussed in July. General corporate net expense this quarter included a $12 million charge related to legacy environmental matters. That [indiscernible] accounts for most of that difference.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23.7%, down slightly from 23.9% in fourth quarter last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.62, up $0.20 or 14% compared to last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 140.5 million. During Q4, we repurchased 854,000 shares at a cost of approximately $84 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.7 million shares at a cost of $402 million.","Turning to Page 6, the fourth quarter results Rockwell Automation total. On the left side of this slide, you can see we experienced a steady sales progression through the year, culminating with a relatively strong fourth quarter with 3% year-over-year growth. The sequential growth was 6%. As Keith mentioned, sales came in at the high end of our July guidance with particularly strong growth in our product businesses.","Moving to the earnings on the right side of the chart. Segment operating margin in Q4 was 20.9% compared to 18.2% in Q4 last year. Segment earnings in Q4 included $15 million of income related to legal settlements. This was the unusual item I referred to earlier. Results also included $14 million of restructuring charges. We're taking the restructuring actions to create some room to redeploy investments to what we consider our best growth opportunities as we enter the new year. The restructuring charges this quarter are about the same as the charges we took a year ago, so not a causal item for the quarter and the year-over-year margin results. However, the income from the legal settlements accounted for about 1 full point of the overall 2.7-point margin increase. The balance of the increase reflects the leverage on higher sales, continued strong productivity across both segments and favorable mix related to the strong product sales growth in the quarter. Our trailing 4-quarter return on invested capital was 31.4%.","I'm going to move on to Slide 7, which displays the Q4 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Architecture & Software sales were $714 million in the fourth quarter, up 6% year-over-year. Organic growth was also 6%. This was, by far, the highest growth quarter of the year for Architecture & Software. Logix sales were up 10% year-over-year. That's the relationship we'd expect with Logix growing faster than the average of the segment. Architecture & Software sales also increased 6% sequentially.","On the right side of the slide, you'll note the very strong increase in operating earnings to $218 million. Operating margin for the quarter was 30.5%, up 5.3 points from Q4 last year. That's an unusually high margin. The legal settlements that I mentioned fell entirely within the Architecture & Software segment and contributed about 2 percentage points to the operating margin in the quarter. If you back that out, A&S margin in Q4 was a little higher than the margin in Q3. About $6 million of the restructuring charges fell in the segment.","I'm going to move to Slide 8 now, which covers the Control Products & Solutions segment. Control Products & Solutions sales in Q4 were just over $1 billion and up 1% from a year ago. Organic growth was 1% and sequential growth was 5%. As Keith mentioned, this is the first $1-billion quarter for CP&S. Sales in the product portion of the segment in Q4 were up 6%, similar to the Architecture & Software segment, and sales for the solutions and service businesses were down 2%. You might recall a very strong sales performance in solutions and services in Q4 last year, so, as Keith mentioned, that difficult comparison. The book to bill for our solutions and services businesses was 0.9, pretty typical for the fourth quarter and significantly better than Q4 last year. Our ending backlog in solutions was 9% higher than at the end of last year.","Moving to the right side of the slide. Segment operating earnings increased 5% year-over-year, and operating margin expanded by 5\/10 of 1 point to 14%. Control Products & Solutions incurred $8 million of the restructuring charges.","Page 9 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Since Keith already provided some color on the full year, I'll focus my comments on the fourth quarter and on the column which indicates the percent change in organic sales. In the fourth quarter, we continue to see a healthy market environment in the U.S. with 5% growth. Canada was down a bit in the quarter, but primarily due to the solutions and services business and that's related to the strong Q4 last year. EMEA delivered 4% growth. We consider that a very good result, given continued sluggish market conditions in that region. Asia Pacific continued to be the region experiencing the most difficult market conditions. We were down 6% year-over-year in Q4, with about 1% growth in China. India continues to be very weak. Latin America continued as our highest-growth region with 11% growth for the quarter, once again, led by Brazil and Mexico.","Turning to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $301 million. The conversion on adjusted income was 132%. For the full year, free cash flow was just over $900 million. That represents conversion on adjusted income of 112%, so above our 100% target. The quarter and the full year were both very strong results.","I'll turn now to Page 11 for a summary of the full year results for fiscal '13. Sales reached $6,352,000,000 for the full year, up 1.5%. Organic growth was 1.7%. The net effect of currency translation and acquisitions was negligible. Segment operating margins for the full year was 19.5%, up 0.9 points from last year. Q4 margin was very strong, and we ended the full year better than we expected. Adjusted EPS was $5.71, up 8% compared to last year. And I think Keith already mentioned that this represents another year of record sales and EPS for the company.","That takes us to '14 guidance. We're expecting fiscal 2014 sales to be approximately $6.6 billion, plus or minus about 2%. That's an organic growth range of 2% to 6%. I'll reinforce a few of the things Keith talked about regarding the top line outlook. We experienced better growth rates in the second half of 2013. That's creating some momentum for us as we enter the fiscal year '14. We also have a stronger solutions and services backlog to start the new year, and we're expecting somewhat better macro conditions with higher rates of growth and GDP and industrial production in every region 2014 compared to 2013. We don't see any significant headwinds in sales, but the risk in our outlook is primarily tied to the macro conditions and maybe more specifically to our emerging markets. I think that's the way to think about the low end of the guidance range.","We expect currency and acquisitions to approximately offset one another in 2014. We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%. That would be about a 1.5 point increase compared to fiscal '13 with margin conversion in the range of 30% to 35%. We expect the full year tax rate to be about 26%, an increase of about 2 points compared to last year. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.95 to $6.35, and we expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%.","A couple of other items not shown here. General corporate net expense should be approximately $85 million, so back to more normal levels. And we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be 100 -- about 139 million for the full year.","With that, I have one more slide, Slide 13, which provides a walk from fiscal '13, fiscal '14 adjusted EPS at the midpoint of guidance. And that's intended to identify some of the larger pluses and minuses and help you position them on the P&L. I'll start with operating pension expense. Interest rates are higher this year, and that's creating a tailwind in operating pension expense. Operating pension expense will be about $14 million lower compared to fiscal '13. That adds about $0.06 to EPS. On the other hand, we expect less income from legal settlements in 2014. The net year-over-year impact will reduce EPS by $0.05. Next is the impact of general corporate net expense being back to more normal levels. That adds about $0.07 to EPS. The 2-point increase in tax rate will cost us about $0.17 and reduced share count should increase EPS by about $0.07. That leaves the bar with label core, which, excluding these other items, reflects an earnings conversion in that range of 30% to 35%.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin the Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, great. Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] So operator, we're ready to take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to dig into oil and gas a little bit. I mean, I think most of the companies out there are fairly bullish on 2014 and even 2015, 2016 in oil and gas. But can you help us understand the timing of the backlog there? And I guess what I'm really asking is that is there some risk that 2014 is not as good of a year as expected at projects and such get pushed back to 2015? And then [indiscernible] little bit of an air pocket in the near term?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, Scott, as you know, the project business always has a potential to be changed based upon the dynamics that are going on in the market. But at this point in time, we have no reason to believe that will be the case. We see a good flow of projects and that we expect those to continue to progress, whether they're in the front-log or the backlog. We're not seeing any change in cancellations or push-outs, particularly no push-outs or, even worse, cancellations at this time. So we would expect to see that pickup in the solutions business that we talked about in '14 compared to the weak year we had in '13.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","China was one of those -- as a follow-up, China was one of those weird regions this year. We walked into it a year ago, feeling pretty good about pent-up demand in automation and rising labor rates and such driving another spend cycle there, but it really didn't pull through. And you came in at the end of the year with at least -- the last couple of quarters of positive. What -- can you give us some color on what your guys there are saying and -- as it relates to 2014? And are we -- is there enough visibility in your front-log? Do you really think that China's going to have a realistic or meaningful full turn in 2014? Or -- what are your customers telling you? I guess that's my question, too.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, certainly, we definitely expect a better year in 2014 in China than we had in 2013. And really, that's based upon the fact that we were able to grow our backlog in the second half of the year and ended up with a backlog higher than what we started the last fiscal year in. And we would expect China to basically grow mid-single digits in fiscal year '14, which is a meaningful turnaround, given the performance we've had. And I think we see it in a couple of areas. We would expect OEM performance to be stronger in the last -- than it was last year. And then also, we continue to see the consumer industries growing in China. And some growth in, I would say, oil and gas in that country as well. So overall, we are expecting continued improvement. I think the indicators got better as we went through the year. Certainly the PMI got back over 50%, barely, but over 50%, and industrial production up -- picked up as we went through the year as well. So we're expecting improved performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on investment spending as what you spent this quarter and then how we are you looking about next year. I know last quarter, you talked about there's going to be a pickup in spending, but it doesn't seem like that's going to have a dramatic impact on incrementals. But, Ted, could you just provide some color on that as your expectations for the year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So I think maybe I'd start with saying, we said we're going to ramp some spending in Q4, we did. Our spending increased about $15 million. Some of that's kind of a normal Q3 to Q4, but some of it was the spending ramp we talked about. I think our thinking on spending for next year is that spending will be in line with the anticipated growth. So we would expect to ramp spending as the year plays out and pretty much proportionate to what we're expecting in growth next year.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the outlook, it would seem to me that the first half of the year, within this 2% to 6%, should see higher growth than in the second half. I mean, obviously, that depends on how the macro plays out through the year. But given the comparables, is that the right way to think about it?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think, clearly, we're going to have some easier comps in the first half than the second half. But in terms of macro conditions, we're also expecting improvement to kind of accelerate as we progress through next year. So I'm not sure we know exactly how to think of the year playing out next year.","Keith D. Nosbusch","And I think, also, we typically have a seasonal decline, Q1 to Q4. So.","Theodore D. Crandall","Q4 to Q1.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I'm sorry, going from Q4 to Q1. So I guess Ted's comment is exactly right, we're not exactly sure how to calendarize the year at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just to drill in a little bit on the restructuring. When people think restructuring, they think of facility realignment and so forth. I'm presuming that's not what you're doing. You're hiring people. Maybe could you give us, either Ted or Keith, a little more color in terms of the nature of your investment spending? Where you're actually spending it? You gave us the segmentation. I'm just wondering where exactly are you spending it.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, yes. Well, you're right. The restructuring is not around facility restructuring, for us anyways. Where we're -- what we wanted to do with the restructuring was to be able to redeploy spending into what I would call better opportunities. And the spending is really coming in, in 2 major areas. The first one would be in development, both in our Integrated Architecture and our Intelligent Motor Control platforms and then, secondly, in sales resources, where we see the best growth opportunities in the global regions that we have. And we really wanted to rebalance what we had from a location standpoint and from a, what, geography standpoint and into the areas from a technical standpoint, where we saw the best growth. So development engineering and customer-facing sales resources is where those investments are going and, quite frankly, where we expect the majority of the investments next year as we both annualized what we did in '13 and increase the investments in '14.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Keith, how much of those investment spending are your targeting for Asia? And the reason I'm asking, I'm here with a lot of folks in China, and there definitely seem to be pretty significant automation trend tailwinds, yet your growth, I realize, because of the economy here, has been slow. Really, it's sort of -- it gets to the question of Rockwell's heritage as a U.S.-centric company and how you've sort of created a much more critical mass. My question really is do you feel that as the next cycle progresses, you have the critical mass in Asia, or do you really need to be sort of dialing up this in some other manner, perhaps through an acquisition or something else? And if you could actually just talk a little bit about process in Asia as well, because there definitely seems to be some pretty good trends in terms of customer demand for those types of verticals.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, first off, we continue to believe that Asia is going to be a meaningful growth opportunity for us in the future, and so we're making investments in Asia in 2 specific areas. One, we have development and R&D capabilities in the region, and certainly, we have and will continue to increase, particularly, our software investments in the region and in China as time goes on. And in fact, we are doing that this year. And secondly, as we have talked before, while we believe the growth in China and in Asia will be strong, we have to continue to build our market-access model there and develop a greater maturity, in particular distributors and build system integrators for our channel development. So we still -- and that's not dollars investment by Rockwell, but that's investment in helping them understand how to take automation to the marketplace. So building out the channel, both distributors and system integrators, is very important for continued growth. With respect to the growth in process, we certainly believe in the Asia region, one of the greatest growth opportunities is oil and gas. It continues to be very strong throughout that region. Obviously, one of the drivers behind that is their economies are growing, and the only way you grow economies is with energy. And they need energy, and they're -- and in fact, China just surpassed the U.S. as the biggest importer of Middle East oil. So there is a lot of expansion that's required for them to absorb the growing middle class and be able to expand those opportunities for the middle class. So the resource industries, as well as consumer products, is a very big focus for us, and we think both of those are great opportunities in China, as well as the other emerging markets in the region.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That make sense. And just last, are you expecting auto in your verticals to expand next year as part of the 2% to 6% or just hold steady? It's obviously still very strong globally. I'm just curious how this plays out in terms of your contribution.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Well, you've kind of answered it for me there, John. And we expect it to remain at high levels, but not be a growth part of our 2% to 6%. It'll be up slightly. But basically, it's at a high level, and we see that being sustained. And our goal is to continue to expand our footprint into more applications in the auto industry, particularly the powertrain side, which we think opens up additional market for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Could you repeat on how the verticals finished off -- ended through the quarter? And what's kind of implied, in addition to auto that you just mentioned, in your guidance for next year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. And just so you know, Steve, you're breaking up a little. I got the question, so hopefully, you'll be able to hear my answer. The -- let's start with the vertical performance in our fourth quarter. And certainly, oil and gas was the strongest with the strong oil prices. We see the continuing investments in the U.S., Canada and the Middle East. Asia and China investment continues to look good but India is weak. Food and beverage was the second-best vertical for us in the quarter. It was also up for the full year. Home and personal care and life sciences had lower growth in Q4. Auto was down a little, which is a typical seasonal pattern for the auto industry. Tire was down in Q4 compared to really strong investments into 2012, but we did see some improvement as the year progressed. Mining was down in Q4, and certainly, the soft commodity prices are impacting that. Metals remains very weak. And in the fourth quarter, we saw a little bump-up in spending in pulp and paper, particularly in the U.S., where there's an aging infrastructure that has to be built, refurbished. And so retrofits was really the growth there, but that was very focused on the U.S. If we go to the -- what are we thinking in the guidance, we think oil and gas, food and beverage, life sciences and home and personal care should have the highest growth. Auto, tire, water waste, water will grow in about the company average, and mining and metals will be flat or down in 2014. So that's our overview of the different verticals of both in Q4 and in our guidance.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","That's helpful. And how was price versus cost in the quarter? And what are you expecting for 2014?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So let's start with the quarter first. I would say price this year has come in at about 1 point, and that was pretty evenly spread across all 4 quarters. Input costs have actually been a little bit favorable for us this year on the materials side, and that continued into Q4. Don't forget we still have to make up for wage and benefit inflation, but the materials part of it has been a little bit favorable.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And 2014?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So then in next year, we're expecting, once again, to do about 1 point of price, maybe a little bit less than that. And then I think on the input cost side, we are not expecting any significant change in input costs as we move into next year. We do expect to have normal wage and benefit inflation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Keith, can you provide a little more color on this acceleration products? I mean, pretty meaningful acceleration here from 1% up to 6%. A couple of questions on that. I mean one, was it kind of a surge late in the quarter? Do you have a big September? Obviously, that's a big month in the quarter. And then was there -- when you look at it kind of sequentially, was there any particular area that stands out in terms of making that leap from 1% to 6%?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think, normally -- we had a normal Q4, which means it generally get stronger as the quarter plays out, and I think we saw stronger performance in September in the product side. That was a little up compared to the earlier quarters. I think from a product standpoint, the highlight -- I think we had 2 very strong platforms that performed for us in the quarter. Logix was up 10%, and so that's obviously drove up the A&S product piece. We also had good performance in our motion products, and we think that was -- motion and safety products, which we believe were part of the success that we're having at OEMs. And then in our CP&S product area, in our standard drives business, they have a new platform, the PowerFlex 520's family, and that continues to have a great reception as a new product. So I think those were the major impact factors for the quarter. But on the -- just the last comment I'd make is we saw product growth throughout the region, so it wasn't just isolated in one area. So it was pretty broad based, which is -- which we also thought was a good sign for the quarter and going forward.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just maybe on process in terms of having confidence and a better outlook for process in '14. I know you've had this dynamic where process x Asia has been growing a lot better than process overall. I mean, is that kind of the story of things getting better in '14, or is there a broader improvement in process that's giving you that confidence?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think the biggest confidence is just in the fact that the backlog is up, and we definitely dug a big hole last year with our over-performance in Q4 and a weakness in orders in the second half of fiscal '12. So we did not have that. And matter of fact, the backlog grew as we exited the year. And so I think just the fundamentals of the business have us feel better than we did, certainly going into the year. And we also think with introduction of PlantPAx 3.0, that, that is another additional capability that we bring to the market, and it's going to add functionality and capability that is very appropriate for those industries. And the continued build-out of our capability and competencies in our sales channels, in our sales organization and with some of our distributors, we think that we are expecting to have a better growth in process next year. And certainly, right now, that expectation is to mid to high single digits for the year, and that is certainly something that we think, at this point, is achievable.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","okay, that's great. See you in Houston.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Looking forward to it. See you there. And it's a great process industry area, so you'll see a lot of focus on oil and gas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Can you guys talk a little bit about the cadence through the quarter and how you feel about how visibility has changed over the past 3 months, either through front log or the amount of detail customers are willing to share with you? It does seem like versus where you guys started out the quarter, things firmed up a lot, maybe in September and I guess based on what other companies are seeing in the October as well. So just trying to get a feel here for how the last 3 or 4 months have progressed.","Theodore D. Crandall","Josh, I think I would say we were pretty strong across the quarter, but it was a typical Q4 where things accelerated as we moved through the quarter. And our Q4, especially on the solutions and service side, tend to be pretty September-heavy. So it's typical in that regard. I think around visibility, I would say I don't think that has changed in any significant way over the last 3 or last 6 months. The market environment seems stable and maybe stable to modestly improving in North America. But we aren't hearing anything significantly different from our channel in regard to growth expectations. I think it would be fair to say we're not hearing anything significantly different from customers at this point. As -- and most of our customers are calendar-year customers, so as we get closer to December and January, we're likely to start to hear more about their expectations for capital spending in the New Year.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Ted. And then just one follow-up. On the U.S., can you give us a flavor for maybe the project type, greenfield versus brownfield, small projects versus big? Just trying to calibrate what types of spending are firming up.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. I think in the quarter, we certainly felt that it was more small projects, which would tend you to look at upgrades, modernization and replacement of existing equipment. And I think that was pretty much the characterization that we got from our sales organization as we went through our quarterly review process. And then outside of that, the projects -- as I mentioned, we saw little bit of project improvement in pulp and paper in the U.S. and then, obviously, the continued strength of oil and gas, which is becoming much broader. I mean, it's throughout Texas, the Dakotas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Colorado. So that, I think, has continued to create other opportunities in those regions for support and supply of equipment and services to that core investment that's required for oil and gas, in particular, drilling in those cases, the production side. So we see that as the other dimension of strength.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question on margins. So it looks like this year, you're expecting to hit around 20%. That's typically been the cap that you've talked about historically, but the cycle continues to kind of push along with modest growth. You've also done some things on the cost side with restructuring. I guess how should we think about that over the medium to longer term? Are you -- can you now get margins above 20%? Are you still thinking that you'll reinvest anything above 20% back into the business?","Theodore D. Crandall","I guess the first thing I would say is I'm not sure we've ever set a hard cap on we would allow in terms of margins. But you're right, at 20%, we're probably a little bit above the prior peak margins we had, which I think came in 2008. Clearly, I think the thing that's going to guide -- that's going to cause margins to go up, most importantly, is what happens with our volume. And we pretty consistently said that if we can see organic growth in the range of, let's say, 5% to 7%, we would expect to drive conversion margins in kind of the 30% to 35% range, and that implies that there is room for continued margin expansion. I think the key issue there is what we see in top line growth and how the balance of this cycle plays out. That said, we do want to make sure that we are investing sufficiently to preserve our technological differentiation and to ensure that we're taking advantage of the growth opportunities. A couple of years ago, we would have said particularly in emerging markets. Now I think it's in emerging markets and some of the new growth opportunities we're seeing in North America. So yes, you're right. I mean, we're going to get that balance of investment versus margin performance right. But with high conversion -- reasonable conversion margins and reasonable organic growth rates, there is some room for margin expansion.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Keith D. Nosbusch","As you know, the challenge for us is always aligning the spending with the revenue. And as an organic growth company, we have to invest before we see the revenue. And certainly, in the second half of last year and as we're going forward here, we do expect to increase those investments. But it's very hard to get the total alignment between when we're investing and when we see the top line improvements. So we're going to keep working that. But Ted's comments were exactly right. We do need to continue to make sure we're investing appropriately in the technology and innovation and domain expertise that's required of a technology company.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just a quick follow-on, maybe you could just run through the major end markets, kind of how they finished or -- in fiscal '13, the exposure there, how big was mining, oil and gas, auto, tire, consumer. If you wouldn't mind just running through that real quickly.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I don't think we saw any, I would say, fundamental change in the makeup of the business between those verticals. Oil and gas probably grew a little. That's greater than 10% at this point in time. And at this point, transportation is around 15% and pretty consistent that it has -- to what it's been. I would say the switch has probably been within the process industries, where oil and gas has gone up a little, mining has gone down a little and pulp and paper and metals have stayed relatively flat at a lower level than historical. And I think that's really been probably the only dynamic in the overall mix change across the verticals.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. This is Rondi back. And Jamie was the last caller in our question queue. So we're going to wrap up the call today.","Thank you to all of you for joining us. Sleep well for those of you who called in from China. Thanks for joining us, and we look forward to seeing many of you at Automation Fair next week in Houston. So thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

Please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second fiscal 2015 quarter earnings release conference call. With me today as always are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the Company's performance in the second quarter and the first half, and some contexts around our updated outlook for fiscal '15.

Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. Before I get started, I just wanted to say a few words about the announcement that we sent out a couple of weeks ago about Rondi\u2019s retirement plans. This will be her last earnings call and I want to thank her for the outstanding job she has done over her career. Her leadership and contributions most recently in the Investor Relations role has been tremendous. I value her consults, insight and positive can-do attitude. She was a pleasure to work with, a true professional and a great person. She helped us become a better company, but she\u2019ll be around for a while yet and I can assure you that you will all be in good hands as Patrick [Goss] assumes responsibility for Investor Relations starting in July. ","Let me start with some highlights for the quarter and the first half. So please turn to page three in the slide deck. Earnings growth in the quarter was robust despite a decline in sales due to a large currency headwind. Organic sales growth was a solid 2.7%, led by Architecture & Software. Logix sales were up 6% in the quarter, driven by our midrange portfolio. Our process business grew 2% in the quarter, which is good results given underlying market conditions. Margin expanded 270 basis points in the quarter, which contributed to a strong adjusted EPS growth of 18%. Free cash flow was also very good in the quarter. Ted will elaborate more on Q2 performance in his remarks. ","For the first half, organic growth was about 2.5%, very close to our expectations coming into the year. The standout region was Latin America, with double digit organic growth. Although Mexico led the growth, it was broad-based across the region. Segment operating margin expanded more than two points in the first half, with particularly strong performance in control products and solutions and adjusted EPS was up 15%. So excellent earnings performance in this market environment."," Let\u2019s move on to what we are seeing in economic indicators and market condition. Global GDP and industrial production growth forecast has softened since January. For the US, industrial production growth has moderated for the past several months, with oil and gas weighing on overall economic growth and incremental consumer spending has not yet filled the gap. Automotive remains strong and consumer industries are still solid. For the second half, we expect market conditions to be similar to the first half, but with further declines in oil and gas and improvement in other verticals including auto, chemicals and some other heavy industries. ","EMEA's economic indicators have improved slightly and we expect growth to be a little better in the second half with improvement in Home and Personal Care, Life Sciences and increased project activities in Metals and Water, Wastewater. In Asia, India continues to recover and we are seeing good growth there. China remains slow, which is consistent with the PMI continuing to hover around 50. For both China and the region, we expect low single digit growth for the second half and full year. Other conditions in Latin America are mixed. Mexico remains healthy, but Brazil and Argentina are in a recession and Venezuela remains very challenging. ","With all of that said, let\u2019s move on to our updated guidance for fiscal 2015. Overall, while not a lot has changed from a quarter ago, we are somewhat more cautious about the rest of the year. Some industrial economic indicators have weakened. Oil and gas customers have cut CapEx more quickly than we anticipated and we would have liked a stronger book-to-bill in Q2. But based on our current assessment of backlog and front-log, we continue to expect higher growth rates in the second half, primarily in our solutions and services businesses. They just won\u2019t be quite as strong as we thought a quarter ago. For our full year guidance, we are lowering our organic sales growth by 1 point and taking off an additional 1.5 points, due to a larger currency headwind. We now expect fiscal 2015 reported sales of about $6.4 billion. In spite of the topline reduction, our expectation for a higher full year margin enables us to maintain an adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.50 to $6.80. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. ","I just have a few closing comments. While I wish we were seeing stronger market growth, I like our competitive position. Revenue diversification and agility are helping us pursue the best growth opportunities. Our strong productivity culture enables us to invest in innovation and organic growth and we\u2019ve demonstrated that even in a lower growth environment, we can still grow earnings and deliver great value to shareowners. ","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me take a moment to mention something that I\u2019m very proud of. We recently received the Ethisphere award for the seventh time, naming us one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies. This recognition reflects our employees\u2019 and partners\u2019 commitment to integrity, responsibility and accountability, all essential qualities of a successful and sustainable company. ","So Ted, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Ted Crandall","Thanks, Keith. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start on page four, second quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.551 billion, 3.1% lower than Q2 last year. Organic sales growth was 2.7%, but currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6 points. Sales were down about 1.5% sequentially. Sequential organic growth was about 2%, pretty typical in terms of the historic pattern, but currency translation reduced sales by over 3 points sequentially. ","Segment operating margin continued to be very strong at 21.6%, up 270 basis points from Q2 last year, despite the sales decline. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher organic sales, strong productivity and favorable mix, partly offset by some increased spending. I\u2019ll note that Q2 last year is our easiest quarterly margin comparison. ","General corporate net was $21 million in Q2, up about $2 million compared to a year ago. Still in line with our expectations for the full year. ","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up $0.24 or 18%, compared to the second quarter of last year. ","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 26% compared to 27.9% in Q2 last year. Last year\u2019s rate included some unfavorable prior period adjustments. ","Free cash flow for Q2 was $269 million, another strong result. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 125% in Q2. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 32%. ","A couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $136 million, down about 3% compared to last year. Also during the second quarter, we repurchased 1.14 million shares, at a cost of $127 million. Year to date, we\u2019ve repurchased 2.69 million shares at a cost of $294 million. In November we talked about a full year repurchase target of $470 million. We are running about 25% ahead of that pace through March. Similar to last year, it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll spend above the target for the full year. At the end of the quarter, there was $757 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. ","The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, both for the second quarter and year to date. I\u2019ll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page five and I\u2019ll focus my comments on the second quarter results. On the left side of the chart, Architecture & Software segment sales were $674 million in Q2, down 1.8% compared to Q2 last year. Organic growth was 4.8%. We continue to see very attractive growth rates in this segment driven primarily by our Logix platform. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by almost 7 points on a year over year basis. ","Moving to the right side of the chart, on 4.8% organic growth, A&S margins were 29.8%, up 210 basis points compared to Q2 last year, with the improved margin primarily due to higher organic sales and another good productivity quarter. Spending in this segment was up modestly year-to-date through March. We expect spending to increase in the second half. ","Turning to page 6, this the Control Products and Solutions segment. In the second quarter, Control Products and Solutions segment sale were down 4.1% year over year with organic growth of about 1.2%. Currency translation reduced sales by about 5.5 points. Organic growth for product businesses is in the segment was 5%, equally strong to the growth rate seen in Architecture and Software. ","However, we continue to experience weakness in the Solutions and Services businesses, with organic sales down about 2%. The book-to-bill in Q2 for Solutions and Services was 1.06. This was lower than we expected and consequently we will be reducing our growth expectation for Solutions and Services in the second half compared to the prior guidance. The order shortfall in Solutions and Services was primarily and heavy industry, with about half that coming in oil and gas. ","CP&S continued to deliver strong operating margins, 15.2% in Q2, up 300 basis points compared to last year. The year over year margin improvement was due to the organic sales growth, continued favorable mix as our product businesses are out growing Solutions and Services, and particularly strong productivity performance in this segment. ","Moving to the next slide, page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the first half. Again, I'll focus my comments on the second quarter. The organic sale growth was driven largely by the Americas, with Latin America continuing to experiencing the highest percentage growth rate. The U.S was up 3.5%. Growth in automotive and customer industries more than offset declines in oil and gas. ","Canada was down 11% compared to Q2 last year. As we discussed last quarter, that was not unexpected. Canada is down 1.7% year to date and we are expecting to be down above mid-single digits for the full year. Canada has a disproportionate exposure to oil and gas and declines there are more than offsetting attractive growth rates in transportation and consumer industries. ","In Q2 in Latin America, Brazil was about flat year over year, but otherwise growth was pretty broad based across the balance of the region, with Mexico up 18%. Latin America was the only region to experience year over year growth in oil and gas in Q2. EMEA was up 1.2% organically. We saw growth in both mature and emerging EMEA, with a little higher growth in emerging EMEA this quarter. ","Asia Pacific was up 3.2%, driven primarily by India and China. India was up 16% off of a relatively easy comparison and China was up 6%. As a final note on this slide, overall, emerging market organic growth in Q2 was up over 8%. ","Please turn to the next page, which is our updated fiscal year 2015 guidance. As Keith mentioned, we are reducing our full year sales guidance but holding the prior EPS range. Across the guidance range, we are reducing sales by about 2.5%. Approximately 1.5% point of that decline is due to currency translation. In our prior guidance, we expected currency transition to reduce full year sales by 4.5%. We now expect currency translation to reduce full year sales by 6% and to reduce full year EPS by about $0.40. ","We are also reducing sales guidance by 1 point to reflect lower organic growth. The lower organic growth is due in part to lower than expected orders in Q2, primarily in our Solutions and Services businesses. Also, we are now seeing an earlier drop in oil and gas spending than we previously expected. These first two factors are related to some extent. And the last factor, we are continuing to see declines in the forecasts for industrial production growth rates. ","Our previous guidance called for reported sales of approximately $6.6 billion at the midpoint. We now think the midpoint will be a little over $6.4 billion. The previous guidance called for organic growth of 2.5% to 5.5%. The new guidance is for organic growth of 1.5% to 4.5 %. At the midpoint of sales guidance, we expect year over year organic growth rates in our product businesses to be about the same in the second half as the first half. We expect higher second half growth rates is the Solutions and Services businesses that\u2019s consistent with our backlog and our front log at the end of March. We also expect to see a typically large fourth quarter for sales in our Solutions and Services businesses. ","Despite the lower sales, we are maintaining the previous EPS guidance ranges of $6.50 to $6.80. We now expect higher margin to offset the earnings impact of reduced sales. The margin improvement compared to prior guidance is based on stronger Q2 margins, a continuation of the strong productivity into the second half and a more favorable earnings conversion on currency translation than we previously expected. ","We now expect operating margins for the full year to be a little over 21.5%. This margin guidance incorporates an increase in spending in the second half compared to the first half. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 26.5%. Given our strong cash generation though the first six months, we now expect conversion on adjusted income to be above 100% for the full year. ","There are a few other items not shown here that I think generally are of interest. We continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $80 million for the full year. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $136 million for the full year and finally we are expect process sales growth for the full year to be at above the company average.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, great. Thanks Ted. Before we start the Q&A, I\u2019d just ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up so that we can get to as many callers as possible. Mark, we\u2019ll then take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan ","Congratulations Rondi. Thanks for all the help. Appreciate it. Hope you enjoy it. Keith, on the consumer industries, could you maybe walk us through a little bit Food and Beverage, Home and Personal Life Sciences, what you are seeing in those different markets. And then also maybe the nature of the investment you\u2019re seeing. You mentioned that Logix was strong in mid-range. I'm just wondering sort of the types of activity you are seeing.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. If we look at the consumer verticals, certainly food and beverage we see that growing in line with the company average in the quarter. We continue to see investment particularly in Asia Pacific and Latin America where there\u2019s ongoing strength with both multi-nationals and indigenous food companies. We are also seeing in particular in Asia and China in particular, the continued need for safety and the risk management of having quality food and quality production processes and that\u2019s driving some of the investment there. ","In the home and personal care, we are seeing continued investment in innovation in their products and many of the companies are expanding their SKU\u2019s and therefore need new and more flexible machinery to do that. We expect that to continue as we go forward in the second half of the year. And as I mentioned, we think home and personal care will be an area that is above the company average growth. And then Life Sciences, we did see growth in all geographies, including EMEA and this is a pick up from what spanned the previous couple of quarter. That\u2019s a quick picture of what we are seeing in some of the major areas buts a good quarter and basically a good outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan "," Thanks, and then just on process, the up two like you said, pretty good in this environment. Can you just maybe frame for us a little bit how you are approaching the process business right now and thinking out how to grow it in a tough oil and gas environment? Are there other verticals you\u2019re approaching or different approach in terms of product set, etc.?","Keith Nosbusch","The product set is pretty much the same. We\u2019ve had some new functionality releases in some of our process in both continuous and the batch hybrid space. But in general, our product portfolio has been pretty consistent over the last couple of quarters after a major release in our planned PAX previously. We are looking forward to some new introductions later this year that will particularly be in the batch hybrid space which is an area that we believe we can continue to grow in. But as far as the markets themselves, while oil and gas is certainly going to see a decline, we believe that chemical will be stronger for us in the second half and going forward. That\u2019s an area that we continue to believe we have some opportunities to grow in. ","Even in oil and gas, if you look at -- Ted mentioned that Latin America grew for us in the second quarter. We think there are pockets of investments that are going on, both in emerging markets where either they\u2019re trying to become more energy independent or they just have a government industry that they want to continue to invest in, whether it be the oil side or the gas side. We see isolated opportunities even in oil and gas and in particular some of the midstream activities that will continue to be invested in. And investments, as we talked about in mining, OpEx spending will become more critical in some of these areas and that spending should continue. ","We are seeing very isolated, but some pockets of spending in metals. It is very project specific. It is not broad-based and we\u2019ve been successful in a couple of those. We also see once again isolated but pockets of spending in Pulp and Paper, which is an industry that has really been reduced over a number -- probably over the last decade. And so they do look at modernization and energy efficiency investments. And in North America we do see modernization going on in some of those locations. That gives you a little feel for where we see the opportunities to have a little bit above average growth to offset some of the oil and gas decline. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan ","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron from CLSA.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations, Rondi, on your retirement. I wanted to ask about Latin America. Very impressive growth coming from Mexico. I\u2019m wondering how much of that is driven by the automotive industry and how long do you think this is going to last?","Keith Nosbusch","Certainly parts of it has been driven by automotive and there\u2019s been investment in automotive from both the U.S car manufactures, as well as European and Asian. We see that automotive investment continuing over the next couple of years. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve identified automotive as one of the areas that is going to grow a little faster for us in the second half. Mexico is where some of these investments are going in. And so we see Mexico and automotive continuing. And when we talk about this, there\u2019ll be two dimensions to that. One will be the car manufacturers themselves, but secondly it will be the tier 1 suppliers to the automotives. ","And certainly that\u2019s an opportunity for us as well. The investment and the automation intensity is different than an automotive plant, but we also see that is an area. The other area that we see as an opportunity for us is the fact that some of the opportunities that we\u2019ll see in powertrain now with FANUC and we do know there are some powertrain investments that will be going into Mexico. Independent of what I just talked about with automotive, that\u2019s probably not where the greatest growth has been for us. There is still significant investment going on in oil and gas. Pemex as you know has opened up the energy sector for external investments. So we see that as a continued opportunity. ","Oil and gas is very important to the Mexican economy and they\u2019re also modernizing some of their existing facilities. We see that as a potential. And then mining, mining in Mexico is one of the few areas where investment is taking place and also then the growing middle class is pushing for the consumer industries and we see food and beverage and brewing, all of the consumer related industries. Home and personal care has also opportunities for growth. So it\u2019s really a broad-based set of industries that\u2019s driving up growth in Mexico and we have a very good partner network there, a very strong distributor organization that is able to support that growth. So we see continued ability to grow in Mexico in a diverse set of verticals.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks Keith. And Ted, I wanted to ask about the margins. Again strong margin performance this quarter despite the decline in reported revenue. You talked about increasing spending in the second half. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us a little more color around that and if you expect the incremental margins to remain at this elevated level for the remainder of the year.","Ted Crandall","First, I think spending has probably started off a little slower for us in the first half of this year than we expected in terms of a ramp up. We are up about 2% year over year in spending in the first half. We expect to be up more like 4% year over year in spending in the second half. As it relates to incremental margins, I do not expect incremental margins in the second half to be as strong as what you saw in the first half, but I expect absolute margins in the second half to be about equal to the first half.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Stephen Tusa","Hey good morning. Rondi, congratulations. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. Just on the forex. I think you guys guided to a 40, something in the low kind of $0.40 range forex impact year over year on the last call.","Ted Crandall","Last call was $0.38.","Stephen Tusa","Okay. So it\u2019s basically another couple of pennies on the percent half. Has anything been changed with regards to the kind of conversion rate of that forex that you\u2019re assuming?","Ted Crandall","Yeah, I think I mentioned that. We think we are now going to have a somewhat more favorable conversion rate for the full year than what we anticipated in the previous guidance.","Stephen Tusa","On the foreign exchange?","Ted Crandall","On the foreign exchange, correct.","Stephen Tusa","What\u2019s driving that? ","Ted Crandall","The conversion rate on the foreign exchange is probably one of the most difficult things for us to forecast. Over time it tends to run at about our normal operating margin, our normal operating earnings margin, but it varies a lot quarter to quarter. Now that we are six months through the year and we\u2019ve got the first half behind us, and it was slightly favorable to what we were thinking, our best estimates now for the second half say that likely continues.","Stephen Tusa","Right, okay. And as far as the kind of the core incremental margin, I mean clearly you guys are putting up some very good numbers. How do we think about kind of 30 to 40 going forward? Is that something you\u2019re managing too? Is it -- I know it\u2019s kind of -- all these numbers are kind of an output obviously on the ground doing business. How do we kind of think about what\u2019s going on structurally?","Ted Crandall","We have made some structural changes that have boosted our productivity this year and I think we are going to run at a somewhat higher level of productivity this year than it's been the case for the last couple and that\u2019s providing a nice boost to our margins. On a year over year basis, I think you are going to see the largest impact of that in the first half because the margin comparisons get a little tougher in the second half. If you looked at our second half expectations and you pulled out the effect of currency, I think what you see is a conversion is margins that\u2019s pretty normal, kind of around 30%. ","That\u2019s kind of a fiscal 2015 answer. In the longer term, we still believe that if we are driving reasonable levels of organic growth and I use that to mean 4%, 5%, 6% organic growth that we should be able to drive 30% to 35% conversion margin. Now it's always going to depend on mix of growth between our Solutions and Service business and Products business and the rate at which we\u2019re ramping spending. It won\u2019t be that in any particular period, but over the longer term we think that\u2019s a reasonable expectation.","Stephen Tusa"," Okay and then one last quick one just in Lat Am. You said oil and gas grew. Was that mostly offshore down there or was it just a flavor of that growth?","Keith Nosbusch","No. It\u2019s a combination. Matter of fact, the majority of it was probably onshore in the Andean region. Countries like Peru, Colombia in addition to Mexico and Mexico is a mix with a lot of it offshore there, but the rest of South America is pretty much onshore.","Stephen Tusa"," Okay great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Richard Eastman","Good morning and Rondi, congrats. Keith, could you maybe just speak for a minute or two, when we look at the modest downtick in core growth that\u2019s forecast now for the year, when I look at this regionally, is this--- it would appear as though maybe expectations for APAC and also perhaps for Canada, maybe you\u2019ve come in a little bit. So thinking about it regionally. And is that again -- I would expect Canada to be oil and gas but APAC, what would be maybe the reason for that? Is that just kind of China globe PMI or?","Keith Nosbusch"," I think just to characteristic it for the year, we believe each region will be down other than Latin America. That would be the way we would characterize it in total, but [indiscernible] I'm talking about versus other -- versus our guidance last quarter. So that\u2019s why we took the overall guidance down organically a point.","Richard Eastman","Then just one follow up question here on exports. With the stronger dollar, are you seeing anything on pricing, -- also competitive pricing there? And also again is the US dollar just making us less competitive from an export standpoint?","Keith Nosbusch "," As always quite frankly, a stronger dollar makes us less competitive export wise. When you see the dramatic change against the Euro, that is helping the Europeans, particular OEMs compete and then there\u2019s also another dynamic going on and that is China. And you look at China now versus the dollar and China currency is pretty much pegged to the dollar. And with what happened with the Euro, we\u2019re now seeing that the Chinese OEMs are not as -- do not have the same advantage against the European Euro. ","So we are seeing some different dynamics going no from a competitiveness standpoint that haven\u2019t been seen in a while, in particular because of the magnitude of the Euro-Dollar change and then the impact on other currencies, particularly with there\u2019s strong exporting economies. And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why you\u2019re seeing a little bit of a decline in the China numbers. China for us, OEMs have slowed a little. So we have seeing some of the impact there. But just to be clear in the US, in the US most of our OEM business is domestic business, not export business. We have not seen a significant impact to our business at this point in time. ","Richard Eastman","Your business, what\u2019s good for the European OEMs competitively versus the Chinese, your component sales into those European OEMs, is that business held up? Because that\u2019s where our cost advantage would be, right?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. So far it has and part of the reason is a lot of the European strength is with exporting OEMs. And so that\u2019s for machinery and a lot of the strength of exporting OEMs is to the US now and that\u2019s into where our strength is and where our capability of supporting those machines and the customer base is the strongest. I think you\u2019ll see our ability to continue to grow. It\u2019s why CompactLogix is growing at a faster rate than the ANS and Logix average quite frankly is because we continue to be able to work the European exporting OEMs and that\u2019s because it's not a domestic sale and it's a benefit to Rockwell to have a strong position with the exporting OEMs in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning and Rondi, I hate to should so repetitive, but congratulations and thanks for the help. It's been a pleasure. I just want to some back to the FX conversion. Is it because the mix of currency has changed i.e. a weaker Euro region performance, weaker Canadians performance or has there been a change to your hedging policy?","Ted Crandall","I would say there has been a change in the mix of currency from our prior guidance to this guidance and that is some of that. We have made no changes in our hedging policy, although the mix in currency, it does have impact on the hedging results related to that. But I would say a lot of this is just about we\u2019ve got better visibility now about what to expect in the second half and we\u2019ve got two quarter under our belt. ","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s clear. And then on the revision to the full year core growth outlook, obviously the second half range is pretty wide as it normally is, but I was a bit surprised you lowered the -- took the low end down to 1.5, which implies a deterioration from the first half run rates. Given that we\u2019re seven months into the year now, I\u2019m just wondering, what drove that incremental course at the low end? And perhaps if or could maybe add some color in terms of what you saw in March going into April.","Ted Crandall","I don\u2019t think we were trying to send any message with the low end. I mean we focus kind of primarily on the midpoint. We always think of the midpoint as the most likely result. We maintain kind of a symmetric range around that midpoint. I wouldn\u2019t read a lot more into it than that. As it relates to the month of April, I would say early in the month it started a little bit slow. It has accelerated through the month and right now I think it would-be fair to characterize it\u2019s -- what we have seen is consistent with our guidance.","Nigel Coe","Okay great. And then just finally, the 10.6 book-to-bill on solutions, it's in the zone of where it was last year 1.1. What sort of book-to-bill were you expecting in your previous plan?","Ted Crandall","I would say we were hoping we were going to see something about 5 point higher than that. So maybe like 1.11, 1.12. We missed orders in Solutions and Services on the order of $40 million.","Nigel Coe"," Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Richard Kwas","Good morning. On the solutions service or CP&S versus ANS, what\u2019s the split on oil and gas exposure between the two businesses? I assume that CP&S with solutions exposure there, there\u2019s a fair amount there, but what\u2019s the split out when think about segments? ","Keith Nosbusch","When we think about the two segments, we don\u2019t have a precise, but we believe A&S is about 30% of it and CP&S is about 70% of it. Within CP&S, about 85% of it is solutions and services. So in total it\u2019s about 40% products and about 60% solutions and services.","Ted Crandall","Rich, what Keith was giving you is kind of the breakdown of our total sales in oil and gas. I think where you were going is and I would agree, we have a lower percentage of sales in oil and gas and Architecture & Software than we have in Control Products and Solutions.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","I think if I do some high level quick math here, as a percentage of A&S, sales is less than 10%. As a percentage of CP&S, sales is going to be 15% blocks for this and 12% for the total company.","Richard Kwas","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then with the debt raise and the free cash flow generation, any change in the priority for use of cash?","Ted Crandall","I don\u2019t think any significant change is in the priority. As I mentioned, cash flow is running a little stronger this year than we originally projected. We are running ahead of pace on repurchases. I suspect that\u2019s going to continue.","Richard Kwas","Okay, great. Rondi, thanks for everything. Enjoy San Diego.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and Rondi, I\u2019ll echo everybody\u2019s congrats and thanks as well. Let me just ask a finer point on the margin question and the margin details sustainability. That FX conversion, could you maybe quantify a little bit more how much that contributed and were there any transaction benefits as opposed to translation in there?","Ted Crandall","Every period we\u2019ve got a combination of translation, transaction and re-measurement gains and losses running through that currency number.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","And hedging.","Ted Crandall","Well, hedging is part of the transaction. But in Q2 we saw a very modest margin benefit from currency. Margins were up year over year 270 basis points. The favorable currency effect related to that we think was about 20 basis points. It was not zero, but it wasn\u2019t large.","Steven Winoker","Okay. And then, so then that brings me back to pricing mix productivity, the other items and you already mentioned the incremental investments came in -- or the year on year came in lower than you expected. But maybe give us a better sense for what you think was productivity versus pricing mix leverage just to help us understand that sustainability question going forward.","Ted Crandall","I would say productivity was probably the single largest item in the quarter, although we did get a favorable kiss from both organic sales growth. We have this favorable mix year over year. It\u2019s probably about half a point. On the productivity, we\u2019ve talked about this a little bit in the past. We have a very well established and ongoing productivity program in the company and it includes our strategic sourcing efforts, a continuous focus on improved manufacturing and labor utilization, product and process cost reductions and all of that consistent with implementing lean and six sigma business processes. ","In the second half of last year, we stepped up our productivity goals, thinking that we might face more difficult macro conditions this year. And we\u2019ve had success across both segments driving higher productivity, but with particularly strong productivity improvement in Control Products and Solutions. We talked last quarter about restructuring actions in CP&S, in the second half of last year. Those are showing up now as higher margins, particularly in our Solutions and Services business. As I said, we expect this to be above average year for productivity improvement.","Steven Winoker","Where do you take R&D?","Ted Crandall","R&D is up year over year, but I would say the increase right now is relatively modest. That is a timing issue. I think you\u2019re going to see that. That will pick up for us in the second half.","Keith Nosbusch","That\u2019s what I was just going to say. That is one of the areas that we\u2019ve been slower with the ramp up simply because of availability and it\u2019s going to be part of that 4% growth in the second half that Ted mentioned earlier.","Steven Winoker","Okay, great. And just lastly Keith, maybe talk a little bit more about the competitive dynamics and process. You talked about the currency impact, but further to that, it sounds like your commentary you think you\u2019re gaining share still relative to even if we just compare to the Europeans or others. How are you thinking about your share moves progressing?","Keith Nosbusch","We believe we continue to gain share in the process space. Obviously it\u2019s an area that we did not compete with the breadth of our portfolio historically. So it\u2019s a new area for us. It\u2019s been the biggest growth in our serve markets over the last couple of years. And we still see process as one of the better opportunities and areas for us to drive revenue growth. So the majority of that quite frankly, is going to be, we have to take share. The market, we have to be growing above the market growth rates here and that means we are going to have to take share. We think the best opportunities for us to take share are in the batch hybrid space and then in certain applications in the heavy industries that we are focused on in oil and gas, in Pulp and Paper, in metals and now chemicals is a better area. ","We\u2019ve identified specific applications, specific geographies that we can continue to make inroads with the modern DCS approach that we take with our portfolio. We think we have some competitive differentiation. We think our plant-wide optimization message is critical for helping customers drive cost and global competitiveness and cost efficiencies and productivity. We have a very targeted approach for where we are looking at it and there\u2019s a large legacy install base that we also have focused on to be able to update and upgrade because of the fact that those legacy systems are no longer supported or available from the original manufactures. We have a very broad, but yet focused initiative here to drive that growth. And we still believe that it\u2019s an area that while the timetable has stretched out, our goal continues to be to double that business that we had as of 2012. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thanks and thanks again Rondi for all the help. In terms of European demand, I think one of your competitors had sounded pretty good about Europe improving in general in the industry business a few days ago. I don\u2019t think you had mentioned some of the OEMs obviously getting a boost from the currency. I just wondered underlying sort of fundamentals beyond just some of those export OEMs, are you seeing a genuine increase in the pace of order intake in Europe?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. We have seen some improvement in the outlook in Europe in our front-logs. We see that the major areas that we see the improvements would be in the Home and Personal Care markets. The Life Sciences markets have been growing there for us as well. And then also if you take very isolated countries or locations, we\u2019ve seen some growth in metals and some growth in the water Wastewater area, as well as part of it. That continues to be an area that we see growth opportunities and consumer is a space that continues to develop and continues to create opportunities for modernization in I\u2019ll say mature Europe. And then in the emerging Europe that\u2019s where we have seen some of the higher growth opportunities. And in fact emerging Europe grew at a faster rate for us this last quarter than Western Europe. A couple of good industries, a couple of good countries and yet a more positive view of the economy there than certainly six, 12 months ago.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks and then just one last one on the margin outlook. Ted, I think you\u2019d called out mix was around 50 bps helped margins in Q2. I think in Q1 it was also a decent drive up, particularly in CP&S of the margin. Just wondering in your second half outlook on margins, what are you -- are you assuming mix is flattish, or still should be pretty favorable?","Ted Crandall","I think mix is going to -- it will certainly be less favorable than the first half because we\u2019ll get that traditional significant jump up in solutions and services sales, particularly in Q4. And as we said, we are expecting better growth in solutions and services in the second half. I think we are going to have a little bit of mix headwind, but my expectation is the volume leverage should make up for that.","Julian Mitchell","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Before we go to our last caller, this is Rondi, I just want make a couple of comments. I\u2019m not sure that we got this out, but I want to make sure that we are clear about our revised expectations for oil and gas for the full year. We think it could be up to 10% down as implied at the midpoint of our guidance. And then if you back engineer second half, that\u2019s probably down something like mid-teens. And so I just want to make sure we get that out. The other thing I just wanted to say a few words quickly before we go to the last caller, since this is the last call that I\u2019ll be participating in, I\u2019ll take a little bit of license here, but I just want to say that it\u2019s certainly been a privilege to represent such a great company to the investing community. I feel really lucky that Ted asked me to do this job seven years ago. I\u2019ve often said that I think I have the best job in finance. Now I\u2019m going to cry. I\u2019ve learned a ton. I\u2019ve really enjoyed working with all of you and I appreciate all the best wishes. With that, I think we\u2019ll just take the last call.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical research","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you very much. Well, we don\u2019t want to make you cry Rondi, but hopefully we are making you blush a little bit. You\u2019ve done a great job. You deserve it. Thank you for taking the last call. Ted, I just wanted to come back. Obviously, perhaps not obviously, but I think the biggest surprise for everyone is the margins this quarter. And it is very difficult from the outside looking in to get our head around productivity and how to model that and that\u2019s always going to be the case for sure. I guess really my question is; as you said you\u2019re pretty comfortable at 30% to 40% incrementals on 4% to 6% organic growth, but how do we think about what you have left in productivity tank if we really are stuck at, pick a number two or three. Where does the incrementals want to go in that type of environment?","Ted Crandall","Sure. So I think that\u2019s a fair \u2013 Jeff, I think your question is beyond fiscal 2015.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","Yeah, beyond fiscal 2015. Correct.","Ted Crandall","I think you\u2019re absolutely right. Look, if we start to operate in an organic growth mode of 2% to 3%, it will be difficult for us to drive incrementals that are in that 30% to 35% range. And part of the reason it will be difficult is it will be more difficult to drive higher levels of productivity.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","Yeah, it makes sense. Could you also give -- it\u2019s interesting, we didn\u2019t get many oil and gas questions. So Rondi, thanks for jumping on with that. It\u2019s like, wow, this whole debate is over. Let\u2019s move on to the next thing. I was interested in what you were actually seeing in OpEx versus CapEx. We\u2019ve heard from a lot of companies that OpEx is getting slashed very dramatically because it\u2019s what people can cut quickly. Are you seeing that type of behavior? A little bit of color on what you can see in the forward CapEx budgets versus the near term behavior of your customers.","Ted Crandall","Yeah, so Jeff I think the first thing I would say is our actual visibility into what exactly is CapEx and OpEx is not great, but the larger declines and the earlier declines we have seen have come more on the solutions and services part of our business than in the product part of our business, which I think would cause us to conclude that so far it has been more about CapEx and not as much about OpEx.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","That\u2019s really interesting. And then just finally on the FX question, so really your guide now at $0.40 puts your FX conversion margin at your average margin roughly speaking. You were anticipating it to be \u2013 so you thought it was going to be worse than typical and we\u2019ve ended with the typical result.","Ted Crandall","That\u2019s correct. Frankly, our guidance last quarter was somewhat colored by a less favorable result in Q1.","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research","Yeah. Okay, thank you for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Take care.","A - Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay Mark, I think you can go ahead and conclude the call.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. At this time you may disconnect.

Baird & Co.","Vladimir Bystricky - Citigroup","Joshua Pokrzywinski - Wolfe Research","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co.","Tristan Margot - Cowen and Company","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Operator","Thank you for holding, and welcome to Rockwell Automation's Quarterly Conference Call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven Etzel","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's first quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Moret","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. We had a good start to fiscal 2018. Organic growth was just above 5%, which was in line with our expectations. Continuing the trend we saw last quarter, growth was again broad-based across the regions. From a vertical perspective, Heavy Industries performed well and were up high single digits in the quarter, including good growth in oil and gas, chemicals, semiconductor and metals. Consumer was about flat. Transportation was weaker than we expected with Automotive down about 5%.","From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market, grew over 5% organically. We saw good growth in Heavy Industries, partially offset by softness in the Automotive and Consumer verticals. Oil and gas grew double digits. EMEA was up 5%, a continuation of the good growth we saw in the fourth quarter. Sales to OEM machine builders remained strong.","In Asia, we saw a double-digit growth in China. India was about flat, and Japan and Korea were down. Recall that Asia was up 20% in Q1 last year, so certainly a tough comparison. Latin America grew 8.5% led by Heavy Industries and Consumer.","I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Logix was up 6% compared to last year. Our Process business continues to do well and was up 12% year-over-year organically. This includes the results of our MAVERICK acquisition, which is now included in organic sales. Adjusted EPS was up 12%, reflecting solid operating performance. Patrick will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance in his remarks.","Let's move on now to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018. Global macroeconomic conditions remain solid based on PMI measures and the latest forecast for global GDP and industrial production. Obviously, U.S. tax reform is an important event, but we are optimistic that the impact of U.S. tax reform on our customers' investment decisions could provide an additional tailwind to our future performance. It is too early to quantify the benefits. An immediate benefit of tax reform for us is a lower effective tax rate in Q1 and going forward. The lower tax rate will drive improved profitability, thus, giving us the ability to make additional investments. Another benefit of tax reform to Rockwell is that we will have much more flexibility to deploy capital. That said, I want to emphasize that our investment and capital deployment priorities remain the same, as summarized on Slide 4.","Our first priority is investing in our business to drive organic growth. A new guidance for fiscal 2018 includes incremental investments to accelerate profitable growth and other long-term objectives. Examples include accelerated software development, investments to help our employees be even more engaged and productive and, importantly, spending to enable customer innovation and complement our existing workforce development initiatives.","Our next priority is strategic acquisitions. We are actively engaged in the evaluation of inorganic opportunities to accelerate our connected enterprise strategy. We will then return remaining excess cash to share owners through dividends and repurchases.","Turning to guidance. We still expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at the midpoint of guidance and expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion, including the impact of currency. Compared to our expectations back in November, we now see slightly better growth in Heavy Industries and a weaker Transportation vertical. We continue to expect Consumer to grow at about the company average. We are adjusting our EPS guidance to include the expected impact of U.S. tax reform on our full year results. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.60 to $7.90. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks, including more specifics on the impact of tax reform on our Q1 financial results and fiscal 2018 guidance.","Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few closing comments. At Automation Fair in November, we showcased how we are bringing The Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We continue to make progress executing this strategy, and the new value from The Connected Enterprise continues to grow at a double-digit rate. You've heard before from us how we practice what we preach, and I'm glad to say that we are being recognized for our efforts.","Our Twinsburg, Ohio plant recently received the 2017 Plant Engineering magazine top plant award for its innovative use of technology to enhance work or productivity. We've deployed our own manufacturing execution software and analytic tools to optimize productivity, improve quality and increase sustainability. Congratulations to the team.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their contributions to another successful quarter. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Patrick. Patrick?","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our quarterly results, let me make a few additional comments about U.S. corporate tax reform. The new tax law not only leads to a lower expected -- effective tax rate going forward, but also provides us with greater flexibility to deploy the cash we have, regardless of where it is generated. Like many other U.S. companies, we've had a large amount of excess cash held outside the U.S. We have initiated the repatriation of that cash, a process that will go beyond the current fiscal year.","As Blake mentioned, our priorities for capital deployment remain the same. Funding accelerated organic growth remains priority #1 followed by acquisitions, then the dividend and, finally, share repurchases. In Q1, we recorded provisional charges associated with tax reform totaling about $480 million. These charges include $386 million for the deemed repatriation and $94 million to reduce the value of net deferred tax assets. We excluded the $480 million charges related to tax reform from adjusted EPS, And updates in future quarters to our estimates of these charges will also be excluded from adjusted EPS.","With that, let's move to Slide 5, Key Financial Information, first quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good first quarter of the fiscal year with reported sales up 6.5%. Organic growth was in line with our expectations at 5.3%. Currency translation contributed 2.5 points to sales growth, a bit less than we expected. And the fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 points. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22.4%, up 120 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from good organic growth was partially offset by higher investment spending. Margin performance in the quarter was a bit better than we expected, as overall operating performance was very strong, but also because spend was a bit light. ","General corporate net expense of $16 million was up slightly compared to last year. You will note on our financial statements that we excluded about $11 million of third-party advisory costs related to the Emerson proposals from general corporate net and from adjusted EPS. These costs were not included in our November guidance and are unrelated to the operating performance of the company. Adjusted EPS of $1.96 was up $0.21 compared to the first quarter of last year, an increase of 12%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to the benefit of higher sales, offset by investment spending.","Last quarter, I mentioned during our earnings call that we did not expect our Q1 EPS to exceed last year's. However, our actual Q1 results came in better than expected, mainly as a result of the much lower-than-expected tax rate and, to a lesser extent, better-than-expected segment operating margin performance. Free cash flow was $179 million in the quarter or 70% of adjusted income. During the quarter, we paid the annual incentives that our employees earned in fiscal 2017. There was no such payment in the first quarter of last year.","A few additional items to cover not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130.1 million, up 0.4 million from last year. And we repurchased about 1.1 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $208.6 million. This is ahead of pace to get to the $500 million full year target we shared with you last quarter. More on that in a little bit. At December 31, we had $400 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another quarter -- another good quarter with more than 7% sales growth. Organic sales were up 4.6% year-over-year and currency translation increased sales by 2.7%. For the quarter, segment margin remained pretty flat year-over-year at a very strong 30%. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth was offset by higher investment spending.","Moving on to Slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up 5.8% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 5.9%, currency translation contributed 2.3% and divestiture reduced sales by 2.4%. Growth in our solutions and services businesses in this segment picked up nicely in the quarter and came in at over 6%. The product businesses in this segment were up more than 5% on an organic basis. Operating margin for this segment increased 200 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to higher sales. Very good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 1.20 in Q1 compared to 1.11 a year ago. ","The next slide, 8, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I will just reiterate that, like last quarter, growth was broad-based across geographies. Also we saw good growth in emerging markets, which were up just under 10% compared to last year. ","This takes us to Slide 9, guidance. We continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion with organic sales growth within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. We updated our currency assumptions, and we now expect that tailwind from currency translation to be closer to 2%, rounding really. And the sale of the business in fiscal '17 will, of course, remain about a 1-point headwind. We continue to expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 21%, 3.5 points lower than our November guidance and mainly as a result of tax reform. Our current estimate is that for fiscal '19 and beyond, under the new law, our adjusted effective tax rate will be in the range of 19% to 21%.","We're now targeting about $1.2 billion in share repurchases for fiscal '18, up from $500 million per our November guidance. To support this increased share repurchase activity, our board recently approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. We now expect average fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 128.4 million for fiscal '18.","We are increasing adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.60 to $7.90. At the midpoint, this implies a $0.40 increase compared to our November guidance. The lower tax rate accounts for about $0.35 of this increase and a lower expected share count for the remaining $0.05. The incremental investments Blake referred to in his comments and somewhat unfavorable mix are, for the most part, offset by stronger-than-expected core performance.","A couple of other items to close. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be about 100% and general corporate net is still expected to be about $75 million for the full year.","With that, we'll move to Q&A. Steve?","Steven Etzel","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard Eastman","Blake, could you kind of maybe elaborate, if you would, on maybe the abrupt deceleration on the expectations around the Transportation, if you could just speak to maybe whether it's geographically or other?","Blake Moret","Yes. I don't think we would call it isolated to a single geography. Although we certainly saw weaker-than-expected performance in the U.S., it's not purely projects, some of which have been pushed out. It's also the MRO spend. We have a very large installed base and so that's a significant portion of our Automotive business in any given quarter. We continue to see new program commitments, particularly in EV. And you've seen some of the news from some of the big brand owners about their large investments in that area. But it's hard to predict the timing of whether some of the business that we're already tracking will come in, in 2018 or push out to 2019. So I would call it, mixed results, but it's -- it includes some MRO as well as program softness.","Richard Eastman","Okay. And then just as a follow-up question. Patrick, could you just kind of speak to -- you had mentioned in the segment profit commentary that investments in the first quarter came in a little bit light of expectations, could you just perhaps maybe put a number on the shortfall there to plan? And then also does that come back in the second quarter and actually increase a bit with your commentary around more cash flow, more flexibility on investments?","Patrick Goris","Rick, it was a few pennies of EPS. And our assumption is that some of that will come back in the balance of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Vladimir Bystricky","This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy. So you highlighted growth led by Heavy Industries, including oil and gas. So can you talk about, within oil and gas, how that market is evolving, whether you're seeing larger projects start to come back in oil and gas specifically and then more broadly in Heavy Industry, whether you're seeing accelerated large project activity?","Blake Moret","Yes. So in oil and gas, the strength and growth is a mix of what we might characterize as more flow business as well as some large projects starting to hit. So I think we are seeing that across segment profile of the various types of business. There are other parts of Heavy Industries that are also strengthening. So we're seeing it in metals, for instance. Pulp and paper in several industries. We include semiconductor in Heavy and that continues to be at high levels of spending.","Vladimir Bystricky","Okay, that's helpful. And then can you maybe just give us a little more color on orders during the quarter? Did you generally see a continuation of, I think, you talked about high single-digit order growth in 4Q? And did you see any change in order trajectory as the quarter progressed?","Blake Moret","We saw a little bit of softness at the very end of December. I will say that January orders -- or business has started in line with guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Yes. So I missed part of the initial comments. I'm on another conference call. But I guess, any comments or any feedback from customers so far on how accelerated depreciation or a write-off there drives more spending? It sounds like if through January, your order rates are in line with guidance, you're not really seeing that acceleration. Is there any pause or kind of pipe -- a pipeline of project accumulation that's still ongoing? Maybe try to calibrate that for us.","Blake Moret","Sure. I think there's a substantial amount of optimism in the market, particularly among U.S. manufacturers, but broad-based across many verticals. And that optimism, whether it's in the treatment of capital investments or lower tax rate to be more competitive worldwide, there's a lot of things to be optimistic about. It's too early to quantify those benefits. So we need a couple of points to be able to draw a line and to be able to come up with a magnitude of the potential impact on additional spend on the part of our customers. But the mood is definitely optimistic.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","And just a follow-up on the order commentary from last quarter. I think, even the last question, I think high single-digit order rates coming out of Q4, unusual for Rockwell as a company to talk about kind of consolidated order rates, but I've always thought of you as a shorter-cycle business. And clearly, organic growth was less than high singles, Is there some pipeline building here or backlog that get you -- gets you guys particularly excited? How should we think about that high single-digit pacing out to the business?","Blake Moret","So when we talk about the strengthening in Heavy Industries, Heavy Industries is biased more towards our solutions business, services and solutions, which is a longer-cycle business. So in that business, some aspects of it may have, on average, a 5- or a 6-month lead time. So we get a little more visibility for that. And because Heavy Industries are up and we talk about a strong book-to-bill in the quarter, we are seeing increased backlog.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Kristen Owen","This is Kristen on for Noah. Just wanted to follow up on some of the conversations that you're having with customers, particularly with your auto customers. Are you talking with them about what's going on with NAFTA? And do you see any risks to your customers from that point of view?","Blake Moret","No, we're not hearing our U.S.-based manufacturers talk about spending with us being impacted as a result of that. Obviously, we're seeing some very large spending being announced by some of our good U.S. customers. I think Ford made an announcement a week or 2 ago, and we'll continue to see that biased around EV. Outside of North America, I can say that earlier this month, I was in China meeting with automotive customers and I was very encouraged. I was talking to indigenous Chinese companies. So these weren't JVs or U.S. companies servicing the China market, wanting to talk to us, a lot in the EV space, both in terms of brand owners as well as Tier suppliers. And there's obviously a lot of activity going on there, a lot of new players. And I'm happy to see that we're covering all of them.","Kristen Owen","That's helpful color. And then just wanted to follow up on the A&S margins, really impressive there. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the puts and takes. What's the natural leverage of that business off of organic growth versus how much are you really allocating toward reinvestments there?","Patrick Goris","Yes, so you're correct. The margin is at 30%, and that's a very high level. We expect it actually to be the high point for the year for this segment. It's really a function of organic growth offset by investments. As we intend to increase some of the investments during the balance of the year, we think that the segment margin there for the balance of the year and the full year will be a bit below the margins we saw in Q1. In terms of incremental margins for that segment, I would recommend you look over a longer period of time over several quarters as to what the incremental earnings has been or the earnings conversion for that segment. If we talk from an overall company perspective in incrementals of 30% to 35%, earnings conversion at mid-single-digit organic growth, we would usually expect earnings conversion a little bit better than that within Architecture & Software.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Joe Giordano with Cowen.","Tristan Margot","This is Tristan in for Joe. I just wanted to go back to the incremental CapEx in software that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Is that for a specific product or specific industry? Could you just elaborate on this?","Patrick Goris","You refer to the incremental investments that Blake mentioned in his comments?","Tristan Margot","Yes, specifically in software where you're investing.","Blake Moret","Sure. So in software, a couple of the main areas of software investment and these aren't new, so these are strengthening existing investments. We talked a lot about the new value from The Connected Enterprise as including information software. And so we certainly see increased investment there, but also in our core. In our core would be the control, the configuration tools as well as the visualization software. That's an important area for us, as we have a common software environment for all the different types of control, whether it be discrete or process or hybrid. And we continue to invest heavily in those areas to simplify the experience throughout the life cycle. So whether it's in the design part of a control project, they operate or the maintain, those are important areas that, we think, we provide differentiation and we intend to continue that.","Tristan Margot","That's very helpful. And then if we could just shift on Logix. It looks like it was the slowest growth since 4Q '16, if I'm not mistaken. Is there any reason for this? Any comments there?","Patrick Goris","I would start out by saying that Logix still grows above the A&S average. The other thing I would point out is that we've had a really good year in Logix last year. It was up 10% year-over-year for the full year. And in Q1 of '18, we grew 6% on top of 8% organic growth, which we delivered in Q1 of fiscal '17. So I think continued good growth in Logix becomes -- become a little bit tougher.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas","Yes. I jumped on late, but just a couple of quick follow-ups on the order slowdown in December. Any particular verticals that you would cite as being more significant than expected?","Patrick Goris","Rich, this was at the very end of December, the last week or so of the year. It was just slower than what we expected. It was in the U.S. No particular vertical.","Richard Kwas","No particular, okay. And then on the auto commentary, Ford is changing their plans around electrification and devoting a lot more investment and CapEx to electrification over the next few years. In terms of your thoughts on what you're seeing in terms of the slowdown, anything attributable to kind of just shift in plans and that maybe there's a push or delay? Or do you think it's maybe early stages of something more fundamental? Just curious.","Blake Moret","Yes. I think we continue to see the basic backdrop of softened SAR, so there is certainly a reduced growth in the overall units. On the other hand, we see the mix of the brand owners continuing to be strongest in their highest-profit products, so the trucks and so on. And that's good for us, as well. EV and the number of new suppliers, the number of new models envisioned, that's an offset to the general reduced growth in the raw number of units being produced. It's hard to say how those will end up balancing, but what we're guiding to is about flat for auto for the full year.","Patrick Goris","And maybe to add to that, that's compared to fiscal '17 where auto globally was up over 20%.","Richard Kwas","Right. So some of it's comp-related, right?","Patrick Goris","Yes. Auto was up over 10% Q1 last year.","Operator","If there are no more questions, I'll turn the call back over to Steve Etzel.","Steven Etzel","Okay. That concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"19201":["Rockwell Automation, Inc.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines for questions.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. I'm pleased with our results for the quarter. As we expected, organic growth was above 7% with growth across a very broad range of industries.","From a vertical perspective, consumer and heavy industries performed well, both growing above the company average in the quarter. Consumer growth was led by food and beverage and life sciences. While heavy industries growth was led by mining and semiconductor. Within transportation, automotive was down 10% in the quarter, weaker than expected and tire was up high single digits.","In the quarter, Logix grew 7% organically and Process grew 11%, demonstrating our continuing progress in this key initiative. Commenting on regional performance in the quarter, the U.S. grew almost 8% organically, despite softness in automotive. We saw very good growth across a wide range of industries. EMEA was about flat in the quarter with growth in consumer verticals offset by continued weakness in automotive. Asia grew about 10% with China sales up double-digits. Latin America sales were up over 20% with most countries in the region contributing to growth. I'll make a few additional comments about our Q4 results. Adjusted EPS was up 25% and free cash flow was very strong. Importantly, we finished the year with healthy backlog.","Moving to the full-year. Fiscal 2018 was an important year for Rockwell Automation, marked by strong operating and financial performance, as well as actions that set the stage for our continued success. First, some highlights of our financial performance. Our diverse industry exposure enabled us to deliver 5.5% organic growth, even though one of our larger verticals was down 10%. Following growth of over 20% in fiscal 2017, automotive was down year-over-year, but we continue to gain share in this market, both in traditional and electric vehicles.","Heavy industries was the largest growth driver this year, with almost all verticals contributing. We saw particularly strong performance in semiconductor, mining and metals. Consumer verticals grew at about the company average, led by food and beverage and life sciences. We are executing well on our key initiatives.","Revenues from Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from The Connected Enterprise, profitably grew double-digits for the year, reaching $300 million. Logix grew 7% in 2018 and Process grew double-digits.","Our segment operating margin expanded, adjusted EPS was up 20% year-over-year. And we had another good year of free cash flow conversion. Patrick will elaborate on our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in his remarks.","We had several other key accomplishments this year, including our partnership with PTC, which will accelerate future growth. In the wake of U.S. tax reform, we significantly increased our capital deployment to deliver long-term shareowner value. In fiscal 2018, we made $1 billion equity investment in PTC. We repurchased $1.5 billion worth of our shares, and we increased the dividend twice during the fiscal year. Each increase was 10%. We continue to invest for the long-term success of our company, customers and our employees.","Let's move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full-year fiscal 2019. While global trade tensions create uncertainty, we have not seen an impact on customer demand as industrial companies continue to focus on productivity. Internally, we are taking actions that are expected to mitigate the impact of tariffs on our operations. Macroeconomic indicators remain favorable across most geographies, with PMI metrics above 50 and continued industrial production growth.","Economic growth in the U.S., our largest market is strong. We have balanced exposure across a broad range of industries, and we expect heavy industries and consumer verticals to continue to be the strongest growth drivers.","Taking into account, what we know about the macro environment, our industry outlook, our backlog and what we are hearing from our customers. We are expecting another good year of growth and financial performance in fiscal 2019.","We expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up 5.2% year-over-year, at midpoint of guidance. This growth rate includes a 30 basis point expected headwind from our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard in fiscal 2019.","Currency is expected to reduce growth by about one percentage point. Including the impact of currency and the new revenue recognition standard, our fiscal 2019 guidance is sales of about $7 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.25.","Now I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q4 and full-year results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Blake and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the fourth quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good fourth quarter with reported sales up 3.7%. Strong organic growth of 7.3% was in line with our expectations and was our best organic growth quarter of fiscal 2018.","Currency translation reduced sales by 2.2 points, about 1.5 points worse than we expected. The fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.4 points. Segment operating margin was 20.8%, up 380 basis points compared to last year.","Excluding last year's Q4 restructuring charges, segment margin expanded 120 basis points. A margin tailwind from organic growth and good operating performance was partially offset by higher investment spending.","General corporate net expense of $14 million was down $10 million compared to last year and about $15 million lower than we expected. We had a favorable settlement of a longstanding legal case during quarter, we'll see the cash benefits of this settlement in future periods.","Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was up about 25% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of higher sales strong operating margin performance and the benefit of a lower tax rate and share count. The fiscal 2018 legal settlement benefit and last year's restructuring charges and gain on disposal about net up (10:10). Free cash flow performance was again very strong in the quarter at $316 million or 121% of adjusted income.","A few additional items that are not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 123.5 million, down 6.3 million from last year. We repurchased 2.2 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $396 million. For the full-year fiscal 2018, repurchases amounted to $1.5 billion. At September 30, we had about $1.1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization. And finally, you will note that just as last quarter, our fourth quarter GAAP results include adjustments related to our investments in PTC and the Tax Act.","Moving on to slide 5, key financial information for full-year fiscal 2018. We had a good fiscal 2018. Organic growth was 5.5%, segment margins expanded 210 basis points or 140 basis points excluding Q4 fiscal 2017's restructuring charges. Adjusted EPS was up 20% and free cash flow conversion was 114%.","Core earnings conversion, excluding the impact of restructuring the divestiture in currency of a little over 40% was stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year. The increase in adjusted EPS was mainly a result of stronger sales and operating performance as well as a tailwind from a lower adjusted effective tax rate and share count. The net effect of the non-recurring items was immaterial on a year-over-year basis.","For fiscal 2018, research and development expense grew about 7% and increased to 5.6% of reported sales. U.S. corporate tax reform was, of course, an important event during fiscal 2018. It not only helped reduce our adjusted effective tax rate, but also provided us access to our non-U.S. cash.","During fiscal 2018, we repatriated about $2.3 billion of non-U.S. cash. As Blake mentioned, we redeployed this cash to our investment in PTC and increasing our fiscal 2018 share repurchases to $1.5 billion.","Slide 6 provides a sales and margin performance overview of the Architecture & Software segment. For the quarter, this segment had about 5% year-over-year sales growth. Organic sales growth of 7% was offset by 2.3% headwind from currency translation. Segment margin expanded 420 basis points year-over-year to 27.9%, higher sales was the main contributor to margin expansion. Lower restructuring charges contributed a little less than 200 basis points of margin tailwind.","For the full-year, organic growth was up a little over 5% and reported sales for this segment reached $3 billion for the first time. Segment margins expanded by 210 basis points, primarily due to higher sales. Lower restructuring costs contributed about 0.5 point to segment margin expansion.","Moving on to slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up about 3% for the segment. Organic sales growth was 7.5%, currency translation represented a 2.1% headwind and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.5%. Operating margin for this segment increased 330 basis points compared to Q4 last year, primarily due to higher sales and lower restructuring charges, offset by higher investment spending. Lower restructuring charges contributed about 250 basis points to margin expansion.","Book-to-bill performance for our Solutions and Services businesses in this segment was 0.93, pretty typical for a fourth quarter. For the full year, organic growth was 5.7% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 15.2%. Higher sales were the primary driver of margin expansion. Lower restructuring charges drove less than half the margin expansion.","The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this in his remarks. So, I will move on.","Before I get to guidance, I'll provide you with a few comments about the impact of tariffs and mitigating actions. I shared with you in April that Section 232 tariffs, have an immaterial impact on our company. During the Q3 earnings call in July this year, I mentioned that we are impacted by Section 301 List 1. The net impact to fiscal 2018 Q4 results was in line with what we expected and shared with you back in July, a little less than $0.05 of adjusted EPS.","Since our July earnings call, Section 301 Lists 2 and 3 as well as additional retaliatory actions by China have been implemented. We estimate the gross annual impact of all tariffs enacted to-date to be about $90 million. The majority of this relates to products and components we purchase from partners and vendors rather than our own internal production.","We expect the net impact on fiscal 2019 results to be neutral as a result of comprehensive mitigating actions. We expect to offset about half of the gross impact through implementing supply chain alternatives and negotiations with vendors. The remaining actions to offset the gross impact include selected price adjustments on effective products.","Given the timing of these selected price increases, we expect the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to have a net unfavorable impact. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the impact of full-year fiscal 2019 earnings to be neutral. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional mitigating actions as appropriate.","This takes us to slide 9, guidance. As Blake mentioned, we're expecting sales of about $7 billion in fiscal 2019. We're adopting ASC 606, the new revenue recognition standard, effective fiscal 2019. This creates a 30 basis point headwinds on organic sales, most of which we estimate will impact the first quarter of fiscal 2019.","For the full-year, we expect organic growth to be in a range of 3.7% to 6.7%. Consistent with currency rate projections for the next 12 months, we expect the headwinds from currency of about 1 point. We expect segment operating margins to expand to 22%, general corporate net is expected to be about $85 million. The increase over fiscal 2018 is primarily driven by lower interest income.","We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 19.5%, similar for fiscal 2018. We're dialing in $1 billion of share repurchases and assume average diluted shares outstanding of $120.1 million. We will share more details with you on our capital deployment and structure plans at our Investor Day next week. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $8.85 to $9.25, at the midpoint, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth on about 4% higher reported sales.","From a calendarization viewpoint, we do not expect EPS growth in the first quarter, as a result of higher year-over-year investment spending, the timing of pricing adjustments related to tariffs, and the impact of ASC 606.","And finally, we expect full-year 2019 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This includes $150 million of capital expenditures. Note that during fiscal 2019, we will make our first payment, about $30 million, related to the deemed repatriation tax liability as a result of tax reform.","Next slide 10. This slide provides an adjusted EPS walk from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. Going from left to right, you will see that the main contribution in EPS growth comes from our poor performance on higher organic sales. Currency is expected to be a headwind of about $0.10. Incentive compensation for fiscal 2018 was above target due to strong performance, so this represents a tailwind for us as we enter fiscal 2019.","We expect higher net interest expense as a result of our cash deployment. As I mentioned earlier, interest income will be lower. In addition, interest expense will be about $10 million higher in fiscal 2019. The tax rate is expected to be about the same. And finally, we expect a large tailwind from the lower share count. Including the adjusted EPS impact related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, we get to $9.05 of adjusted EPS at the midpoint.","So, with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Blake.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. Before we move on to Q&A, I want to make some additional remarks. This quarter was a strong finish to a great year. I mentioned several of our key accomplishments in my earlier comments. Looking to fiscal 2019, we have another exciting year ahead of us. We will continue to provide new value with The Connected Enterprise, which gives us more ways to win. As a pure-play, our entire focus is on helping industrial companies and their people be more productive. We have no competing priorities.","Our capital allocation will continue to balance strategic inorganic investment with consistent capital return. Our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation give us tremendous flexibility to continue on this path. Acquisitions made in recent years continue to perform well and the pipeline remains active. Our key areas of focus are information software, Connected Services, process expertise and regional share expansion. While the size, amount and timing of deals can never be predicted with certainty, we continue to target a point or more of annual growth from acquisitions.","Last week, we again increased our dividend, which will bring our annual payout to over $450 million. In 2019, we are planning to spend $1 billion on share repurchases. So, in total, our targeted return of cash to shareowners is about $1.5 billion. Our strategy generates strong sustainable cash flows that we will continue to direct the value creating opportunities.","I look forward to seeing many of you next week at our Annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania this year. This is a great opportunity to see how we are bringing The Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We will showcase our latest innovations, investments and Information Solutions for thousands of customers from around the world, highlighting the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners.","Among other innovations in a particularly eventful year, customers will see our software combined with PTC technology to create powerful Information Solutions, an important new Logix processor and additional high performance drive releases for Process applications. All of these offerings increased customer productivity by converging real time control with information and analytics that drive positive business outcomes.","The opportunities for integrating control and information are greater than ever, and the power of our Connected Enterprise vision to increase industrial productivity is being demonstrated across all of our verticals and around the world. We are best positioned to deliver this value to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base, we have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships.","The value we provide is in high demand as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise, to become more competitive. More next Thursday during Investor Day.","Finally, I'd like to thank each of our employees and partners for their efforts to bring The Connected Enterprise to life, within Rockwell and add our customers.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start the Q&A. Steve?","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.","Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead.","Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, gentlemen. This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. The first thing, I'd like to focus on is the Process business, which is clearly picking up on a nice comp even. Is that driven by large project? Or are they more distributed by size, type and really what are the main drivers there by vertical, if you could parse that out for me?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Peter, the Process business is really a nice balance of project as well as more flow business. And remember for us a big project is in the mid-single digit millions of dollars, so very little of what we do is truly mega projects. It's distributed across a good balance of industries. So, while we had good growth in oil and gas in the U.S., we also saw significant growth in orders in mining, especially in Latin America that will result in shipments during fiscal year 2019. But it's really a balance of both projects that we've talked about in the past like NioCorp and Codelco as well as flow business, where we might be providing Control Products that are integrated by someone else into well head and other applications.","Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. And then maybe since you mentioned it, the growth in Latin America was obviously very strong. How much of that growth was mining-related versus other process versus other verticals? And within the Process business areas, is that mainly greenfield project or retrofit an overhaul? And is that driven by a large project or again more of a mix?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, we're really happy with the growth in Latin America. I think it's been a pretty consistent story for us and complementing the strong growth in mining, we also saw a consumer growth. It was one of the regions that we actually saw some growth in transportation in Latin America as well.","Within the mining vertical, most of that is upgrades to existing mines. So, these aren't brand-new operations. In the case of Codelco, this was providing a supervisory control and data acquisition system with a good deal of services to make sure that the data transfer from the mine to a central control room was done securely, but it was an existing mine that that upgrade was being performed at.","Peter Lennox-King - UBS Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Sounds like CapEx isn't dying, as the market might imply it is, with what you guys put up, but what was soft, as you guys noted, it was just auto and that's not a surprise at all. But what's the cadence of that picking back up? Is it a function of waiting for some of these EV facilities to be built? Is it just really a function of obviously weaker SAAR? I mean, I guess part of what I'm asking is, as you break down between CapEx and OpEx, and really how you see the cadence of that getting better over the next several quarters or how long you think it's going to take?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hey. I think it's helpful to look at our general automotive business as having a few components. So, obviously, the ongoing MRO business from an installed base, particularly in the Americas, is an important part of that. We did see a softer than expected result from that in the last quarter. The other piece is the EV and power transmission business, which remains at around $100 million for us.","And then third is the programs in traditional internal combustion engines. And for new project activity, for IC engines as well as EV, there continues to be a lot of vigorous activity. In most cases, these are delays, but there's still the expectation that we're going to see those programs in 2019 and beyond.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","Are they \u2013 well, you know and I'm \u2013 I'll ask this offline, but I still struggle sometimes, guys, and maybe it's my fault, not yours, to see where the real tangible synergies are with PTC. And again, maybe it's my fault. But can you give us some tangible examples of maybe how you guys have gone to market together or what you're doing and how you're both benefiting from this?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Scott, I'll talk about a couple of recent successes that have resulted in orders, subscription-based orders that we don't think we would have maximized without the relationship with PTC.","To begin with, for a long time our growth has been driven by the automation of basic processes to remove repetitive physical labor in those operations. But we and our customers are recognizing that there's a whole new level of productivity that comes from the Information Solutions, taking the data as a byproduct of those control processes and turning it into insights that allow additional productivity. So, making the workflows more efficient, being able to provide traceability to improve quality, there's a whole host of applications that provide cost savings to our customers.","And in the first example, in a major automotive, we have a great position on the plant floor with that customer. But they were also looking at PTC software, because PTC has some good tools. When we came in together and said we're going to combine our knowledge of the plant floor with our software, things like our FactoryTalk Analytics with ThingWorx from PTC, it was game over. And we beat some big competitors to win the pilot for that project, which is going well and we expect that to move into a rollout over the next year.","In the second example, in a large mining company, they were looking to create a digital twin for their operations. PTC, again, has a good portfolio of design tools that fit nicely with the real-time control and visualization hardware and software that we're already providing to that mining company, and together we have the most powerful combination in the world. It's that simple.","Scott Reed Davis - Melius Research LLC","That's encouraging. Thank you. Good luck, guys.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Deepa B. N. Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. Blake, a question for you on automotive growth expectations for 2019. What's embedded in your forecast as you look at the midpoint of the organic growth guidance? And how should we think about which regions help the most? I think EMEA, there was a comment in the presentation that said it was a little weak.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. So, at the midpoint of guidance, we're looking for continued growth to be driven by heavy industries as well as consumer. And in consumer, food and beverage and life sciences are the largest contributors of that. At the midpoint, we're expecting a flat automotive vertical, so any growth in automotive would be upside, all other things being equal.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hey, John.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Morning, guys. So, I guess, there've been quite a few \u2013 like there's been quite a few management changes of late. There was recently, I guess, John McDermott's going to be retiring. Can you just maybe talk to \u2013 obviously Ted's left. I mean, can you talk to how these changes or these actions, how they kind of dovetail with the positioning of the company and where you tend to sort of take things going forward?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Happy to. Let me start by saying that Ted's not gone yet, so we continue to benefit from Ted's wise counsel and his involvement. But thanks for asking that, because we've had a couple of leadership changes that we talked about, beginning in June and then most recently in our sales and marketing organization, and they are all about accelerating our ability to bring The Connected Enterprise to life.","So, when we moved Frank to Control Products & Solutions, it was to recognize the growing importance of combining the technology and the expertise, and as you know CP&S has a high component of services and solutions, which are going to be critical to ensure positive customer outcomes as we deploy our technology.","We also created a Connected Enterprise consulting function led by Bob Murphy, who previously have been running a worldwide operations, brings unmatched credibility when talking to customers to help them better define their business problems.","Most recently, in the sales and marketing changes, we provided additional focus to our most strategic enterprise accounts as well as our largest investment, which is, of course, PTC by dedicating a member of my staff to growing in those areas. And we also recognized, the continuing importance of growing share in Europe and Asia. And so, our sales leader who has responsibility for the marketing as well as the regional selling functions is going to remain based in Brussels. And I think it's important for me to begin to globalize my team, so that we get that perspective from the needs of customers around the world.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","I appreciate that. Thank you. Like you mentioned PTC, can we just talk a bit about what kind of investments Rockwell is going to have to make to actually drive revenue and other types of synergies from this partnership? Is it material and maybe you could just less, perhaps, on the dollar side, but more what operationally, you're going to have to do?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, deeper in the organization, we've made sure that in addition to the selling focus that I talked about, we're also taking care of the back office and so that's creating the necessary IT infrastructure, so that we take subscriptions at a higher rate than we have in the past. That's obviously important to decrease the susceptibility of our business to economic swings over time. That's going quite well to have a subscription portal in place, it's making sure that we have the right delivery resources within our Solutions business, to ensure that when a customer needs help in applying the software that we have experienced people ready to go. And they are, in fact, involved in some of those early engagements, I mentioned to Scott's question. It's also the converged roadmap for the information software technology to make sure that ThingWorx and our FactoryTalk Analytics and our MES offerings, fit together really well and are simpler for our customers to deploy than any other alternatives that they might have.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","So, it sounds like these are organizational changes versus sort of hard dollar investments. Is that a fair statement?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It's really both, John. I mean, we were already investing a significant amount in the information software, prior to this, with MES, with FactoryTalk Analytics and so on. This allows us to continue at a similar rate of investment, but then getting the benefit of the considerable investments that PTC has and continues to make in the IoT area. So, it's both.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Yeah I know I understand. I mean, just lastly, your EV initiatives, are the players that you're partnered with your traditional customers, I mean, there's an awful lot of startup Chinese EVs and other things. I'm just curious, I mean, some of those are likely going to go out of business, right? So, I'm just \u2013 could you talk a little bit about your EV footprint and is it more traditional with your established customers or is it more kind of growth year with the new startups or how should we \u2013 just a little bit of more color would be helpful.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Well, it's a nice combination. I mean there are somewhere close to 100 startups that we're engaging with for cars and trucks and other vehicles in the space. And as you said, not all of them are going to make it. But there's also what the established brand owners are doing, and we have heavy involvement there. And then it's the suppliers. So, the powertrain suppliers are a mix and many of these are established companies, but they may not be companies that we were working with as much in the past. And when we re-entered the powertrain space, we became familiar to them again. And as we've talked about the basic manufacturing process for an EV powertrain is, we have a higher readiness to serve there than we do in the traditional IT side. So, it's quite a nice opportunity for us with some of those traditional players as well.","John G. Inch - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys good morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","How are you? What are you guys seeing on the food and beverage side, just globally? Company we cover, JBT, talked about some delays, some merger activity, stuff like that. And anything you're seeing on food and beverage into 2019 that's concerning at all?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","People around the world, as more people are entering, the middle-class people are still looking for a wider choice in what they need, flexible packaging and quick changeover to different packaging styles, to maximize shelf space. Those are still some of the key focus areas for the machinery builders as well as the users as well.","One of the important innovations in that space that relates to the ability to quickly change different packaging styles is the Independent Cart Technology that we launched over the last couple of years, and if you go to PACK EXPO most recently, and Interpack, you'll see almost every major supplier showcasing that technology, and we're right in the middle of that.","I would also say, now that a lot of the big multinational food companies have addressed some of their cost issues, expansion and growth becomes a little bit more of the focus for them. But in either case, they're looking for doing that as quickly and as productively as possible. And so, we're right there with them, the consumer, and particularly, food and beverage companies are some of the earliest adopters of this whole Connected Enterprise concept of integrating control and information to get that next level of productivity.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And I'm not sure, if I caught this, and I'm not a math guy. Patrick, what is the incremental margin you're thinking about for next year? I mean, I can do the calc, but just curious, if you mentioned, there's a decent amount of moving parts. So, what's kind of the core incremental you're looking for?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Steve, the reported incremental margin will be about 35% for the full-year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And that includes all the stuff you talked about. I mean, it seems like it's relatively clean, as there's a lot of moving parts, but a lot of them offset.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. The way you can think about that, the 35% is the reported earnings conversion. Bonus gives us a tailwind of about 5 points, but then we talked a little about tariffs, we get revenue, but not necessarily earnings. And this gets us back to core conversion of about 35%.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot for the color.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Thanks, good morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","According to \u2013 hey, just wanted to dig into Logix plus 7% for this quarter. And we tend to see Logix grow in above the average and didn't this quarter. So, maybe just address that. I understand auto was down 10%, but it was down more this year. And I'm just curious, I mean, the gist of my question really is, are we going to see some dollar spending moving from Logix to maybe the IS connected layer? And then machine tool, we've heard the machine tool is weak globally. And I'm wondering, if that was a factor as well?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, within Logix, we continue to see really good growth of our mid-range offering with CompactLogix. But you also see at the upper end of the Logix range, particularly in heavy industries, you see the ControlLogix sales encouraging as well. And as I mentioned before, we continue to invest in a very contemporary platform, we have been showing a new processor at Automation Fair, which I think \u2013 I think you'll find interesting as well.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Nigel, also for full-year 2018, Logix was up about 7%, which is a couple of points, above the A&S average. And for 2019, we expect Logix to be a little bit above the A&S average as well.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, so nothing with (44:48)","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Nigel, I'm just going to add, one additional thing is the Information Solutions and Connected Services fit really well with Logix. One doesn't replace the other, the Logix creates the data and aggregates the data that come from the basic control processes that feed those Information Solutions and provide the opportunity for those higher value services. So, they really \u2013 they fit together well and they're both fundamental parts of The Connected Enterprise value proposition.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then just on the leverage. Even with the $1 billion and the dividend increase, I think your net leverage is going to be about 0.7 times by the end of this year. Gross leverage, maybe 0.9 times EBITDA. Can you just remind us, what types of ratios you imagine to going forward from here now that you've got tax reform?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. Nigel, we'll talk a bit more about that next week, but the way you can think about it is, we end this fiscal 2018 with about $0.7 billion of net debt. We think by the end of fiscal 2019 that will be about $1.7 billion. And so, the way we'll get there is, we'll expect to reduce our cash and investment balance, which was $1.1 billion at year end, to close to about $0.5 billion. And at the same time, total debt will increase by about $400 million that's what we target now.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then just, I mean, just want to say, but it sounds like 1Q is going to be impacted by ASC 606 and tariffs, so maybe a little bit of color on 1Q would be helpful. But, I know you don't guide quarterly, but just want to know about that? Thanks, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. What I mentioned Nigel is that in the first quarter, we don't expect EPS growth and you mentioned two of the elements, but the main element will actually be the timing of our spending, the investment spending. Q1 last year was particularly like, we had really high segment margin. And as we released (46:54) some investments in fiscal 2018, the year-over-year increase in our first quarter of 2019 will be the largest of the year from a spend perspective.","So, there really \u2013 the tailwinds in the first quarter, of course, we expect some organic growth. There is a tailwind from some lower share count, but there are three main, I'd say, headwinds for the first quarter. The first one we just talked about, the investments that will be the largest one. Then the second one is the impact of ASC 606, which will be mostly impacting the first quarter. And then lastly, the timing of the pricing on the tariffs. And so, we think the net of that means that we won't see EPS growth in the first quarter.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Maybe just the first question for Patrick, following up on your comments on investment spend. I think you had a placeholder for last year of $70 million to $80 million of increase. Just wondered where that came in, in the end. And what sort of magnitude of increase do you anticipate for fiscal 2019 overall?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, what we \u2013 basically the spend increase in 2018 was in line what we have shared with you. The fiscal 2019, I mentioned earnings conversion of about 35%. That embeds spending growth at a little bit lower of a rate than our organic growth. And so, think about that 3.5% to 4% spending growth in fiscal 2019. And again, the biggest increase will be in the first quarter. It will be significantly more than that in the first quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. Thank you. And then my quick follow-up would just be around...","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Julian, maybe one \u2013 maybe just one other thing, related to spending. We do expect to increase R&D again faster than our other spend in fiscal 2019. And so, you saw our R&D as percent of sales pick up in fiscal 2018. Our current projections are that will again increase in fiscal 2019. So, our priorities for spend, R&D and then some of the commercial investments that Blake was also referring to including, related to PTC.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just switching to the demand side again, China I think you'd said in the prepared remarks grew double-digits. Wonder if you could give a little bit more detail on what your expectations are for the fiscal 2019 in China, and any major differences by end market within China?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. So, fiscal 2018 was actually a good year for us in China. We were up double-digits for the year. But fiscal 2019, excluding the impact of ASC 606, will be above the average we think in China. So, mid to high single-digits. The ASC 606 revenue rec change impacts Asia and China more than the other regions. So, on a reported basis, we think we're \u2013 on an organic basis, we think that China will be up a little below the company average in fiscal 2019, but that includes a headwind of a couple of points, we estimate related to the rev rec change.","Again from a vertical perspective, it's pretty broad based, in terms of what we expect for growth next year in China. We see upside in life sciences as we did this year; chemicals, food and beverage, and we think that oil and gas and transportation might be about mid-single digits next year.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning, Josh.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just wanted to follow-up on the 1Q comment. Should we expect to see all of that normalize into 2Q? Because I think for the full-year 35% EPS, or earnings conversion, it kind of implies the next three quarters need to jump up a lot. I just want to make sure that 2Q wasn't more of a ramp or is it an abrupt change 1Q to 2Q on getting over some of those margin headwinds?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It will be a ramp with the largest year-over-year benefits in Q3 and Q4 from an EPS growth point of view.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just thinking about some of the heavy industry and bigger projects, the book-to-bill at 0.93, I think kind of lines up with the last few years on average, not as big as last year, but that was probably an outlier. I guess, given that it seems pretty typical, is there something outside of project orders or solutions orders that you're seeing that gives you that, kind of, quantitative confidence? Because otherwise, it just seems to be good but not accelerating?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think I'd start with backlog. So, backlog in Solutions and Services is up double-digits so that's a nice start to the growth. And what orders we have seen with some previous strong Q2 and Q3 book-to-bill have built that.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Josh.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Blake or Patrick, U.S. growth continued to accelerate in Q4. Basically, did that every quarter for you in FY 2018, so can you talk about how you're thinking about the U.S. in 2019 in the sense that, can it sustain that sort of mid to high single-digit growth rate that you've seen lately and have you seen more evidence of onshore and\/or just simply higher investment in the U.S. helping your business, given all the increased protectionism out there?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah, we continue to see good opportunities in the U.S. and that's coming of course from the basic metrics that continue to be strong. What we're hearing from customers, the industry outlook as well. I mentioned before that oil and gas is strongest in the U.S., as we look around the world. We talked earlier in the year about even mining activity and so that heavy industries growth as well as the continuing expansion of consumer led by food and beverage and life sciences are important signs for the future. And we continue to think that we're taking share. We have a great position in the U.S. Good products, good market access and we think that, that march is continuing.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then alternatively, Europe does look relatively weak over the last few quarters. I know auto is dragging that down a little bit. I would assume that Europe continues to be relatively lethargic in FY 2019, are you seeing any signs that heavy industries are starting to come back in Europe and that could pull up Europe in 2019 at some point?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We think Europe next year will be low single digits for us. We think that it will be the region with the lowest growth. In terms of the verticals next year in Europe, we don't expect any growth in transportation, but we do expect in some heavy industries, we do expect some growth next year, as we do in consumers. So, low-single digit growth. Automotive is clearly still a headwind rather than a tailwind in that region.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I would also add that, while it's a smaller vertical for us, life sciences continues to be strong in Europe, and that's an area where I mentioned before the Independent Cart Technology for single use, pharmaceuticals as well as the MES system, so that we have a very strong position and help us there with some of the new value from The Connected Enterprise.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Andy you think of life sciences and mining being the two verticals in Europe, where we do expect the strongest growth in fiscal 2019.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. That's helpful.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks Andy.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Our final question from \u2013 for today comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate you fitting me in.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So my first question, maybe you could provide a little bit more color around what you're doing specifically to offset the $90 million in tariff headwinds? And so, I know you mentioned select pricing actions and also actions along your supply chain. But are there certain guideposts that we should be looking at throughout the year to make sure that the progress is being made?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. So, maybe \u2013 being a little bit into more detail on the $90 million. As I said, we expect to offset half with supply chain alternatives and negotiations with vendors. Of that, I'd say that two-thirds is in the execution phase now, one-third of that is in, I'd say, the planning phase. Then the other half of the gross impact of the tariffs is addressed by selective price increases on the top \u2013 on the products that are impacted by the tariffs. The price increase has gone into effect October 21 and the second one will get into effect \u2013 will come into effect in a couple of weeks, that's why we're saying that there's a little timing from a Q1 perspective; although for the full-year, we expect to be neutral.","I'd also add that the gross impact on the tariffs, it's only maybe 20% of that is related to our own manufacturing. The balance is with what we buy from vendors, whether they are components or whether they are some branded products.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And my one follow-up, so clearly some headwinds in 1Q, a lot of the benefits seem to be coming through in the second half, I know you guys don't love giving quarterly guidance; but on 2Q, should we expect a seasonally more normal 2Q, typically you guys do about roughly 23% of your earnings in 2Q, or is that going to be lighter as well as these benefits come through?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I'll stick to my earlier comment that most of the EPS growth will be in the second half of the year, and 2Q will be around.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Wonderful. Thanks, guys.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So just to summarize, fiscal 2018 was a very good year with growth in key areas for us. We delivered strong operating and financial performance, we had several important strategic accomplishments this year, and we're looking forward to another good year in 2019.","Steven W.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter FY '15 earnings conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Rondi Rohr-Dralle is here as well, as Rondi and I transition today. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the company's performance in the third quarter and some context around our updated outlook for FY '15. Then Ted will provide more details on the result as well as our sales and adjusted earnings-per-share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about one hour today.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.RockwellAutomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. With that, I will hand the call over to Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Patrick and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I hope that all of you in New York will find a cool spot, given the heat forecast coming. Before I get started, I would like to take a moment to formally introduce Patrick Goris, who as I mentioned on the last call, has taken over IR responsibilities with Rondi's upcoming retirement. Patrick joined Rockwell Automation over nine years ago and he has been be finance leader of our architecture and software segment for about four years now. Patrick, welcome to your first official earnings call.","I'll start with some highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. I'm pleased with our performance in the quarter as we delivered another quarter of solid earnings growth, despite a year-over-year decline in sales due to a large currency headwind. Organic sales growth was 2.2% with higher growth in architecture and software. EMEA with 4% organic growth was our highest growth region this quarter, driven by emerging countries. Safety continues to do well and was up double digits. As you remember, we're the market leader in industrial safety control and this growth reinforces its importance to our OEM and process initiatives.","Logics grew slightly above the architecture and software growth rate. Process reflecting underlying market conditions was down 3% in the quarter. Margin expanded 200 basis points in the quarter which contributed to adjusted EPS growth of 7%. Free cash flow continues to be very strong. Ted will elaborate more on Q3 financial performance in his remarks, but I will add a few comments about our performance through three quarters this year.","Our revenue diversification efforts, whether from a geographic or vertical perspective, are yielding results. We have shown that we can continue to grow even if an important vertical like oil and gas is contracting significantly. Excellent execution and strong productivity drove a 210 basis point improvement in segment margins, resulting in double-digit EPS growth in spite of lower sales. Our ability to generate cash remains excellent, with strong free cash flow conversion through three quarters. These are very good results in a slow growth environment.","Let's move on to market conditions and economic indicators and what we expect to see in our business for the remainder of the fiscal year. Global GDP and industrial production growth forecasts have softened since April. For the U.S., we experienced 3% growth in Q3 and expect about the same in Q4. Our full-year growth rate will be lower than we thought one quarter ago. Automotive and consumer remain the strongest verticals in the U.S., oil and gas, the weakest. As expected, we saw improved growth rates in EMEA during the third quarter. We expect continued modest improvement in this region led by consumer, particularly life sciences.","In Asia, India is doing well and we're seeing good growth there. China, however, continues to slow and third quarter sales were flat year-over-year. We're not seeing improvement in the China market as capital spending remains very constrained. While oil and gas entire are down year-over-year in China, we continue to grow in consumer and auto. We now expect China sales to be about flat for the year. China does remain a very important longer-term growth opportunity for us.","We just do not see a short-term catalyst for growth. Market conditions in Latin America remain [indiscernible]. Mexico continues to be the bright spot, while other countries including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are in a recession. Auto and consumer are growing above the region average and oil and gas is growing in Mexico. Other heavy industries including mining are weaker.","With all of that said, let's move on to our updated guidance for FY2015. We told you a quarter ago that we expected higher growth rates in the second half of this year. Since then, the outlook for industrial production has weakened and our third quarter organic sales performance came in somewhat below our expectations. While sequential growth will continue in Q4, we know longer expect higher year-over-year growth in the second half and we're lowering the midpoint of our full-year organic sales growth guidance by 1 point.","Assuming a smaller headwind from currency, we continue to expect FY '15 reported sales of about $6.4 billion. In spite of lower organic growth, improved margin performance enables us to narrow the adjusted EPS guidance range to $6.55 to $6.70. At the midpoint, this would represent a 7% increase in adjusted EPS on about a 3.5% year-over-year decline in reported sales. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","I just have a few closing comments. While the market conditions may not be ideal, I like our competitive position. We have a differentiated portfolio of products and services and dedicated employees, distributors and partners that are committed to provide the best service to our customers globally. We remain focused on innovation and I am confident in our ability to deliver attractive shareholder return while we continue to invest in profitable growth opportunities.","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me take a moment to mention Rockwell Automation's TechED 2015, an important annual training event we hosted in June in San Diego. During the event, customers, distributors and partners learned from industry leaders on how to achieve operational excellence with expert-led sessions, hands-on labs and innovative presentations. Our June event was a resounding success with about 1,800 attendees from 45 countries and all 50 states.","This event is a good example of how we, together with our distributors and partners, continue to help our customers optimize their operations. Our main customer event of course is Automation Fair which will be held in Chicago this year on November 18 and 19. The investor meeting is scheduled for the 19th. Please mark your calendars as we hope to see you all there. With that, I'll turn it over to Ted","Ted Crandall","Thanks, Keith. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'll start on page 4, third quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.575 billion, 4.5% lower than Q3 last year. Organic growth was 2.2% but currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.8%. Reported sales were up about 1.5%, sequentially. Organic growth was 2%, sequentially. ","Segment operating margin was 21.8% in the third quarter, up 200 basis points from Q3 last year, despite the reported sales decline. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the high organic sales and strong productivity, partially offset by modestly increased spending. General corporate net was approximately $22 million in Q3, up about $4 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.59, up $0.10 or 7%, compared to the third quarter of last year.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.9% compared to 27.6% in Q3 last year. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 27%. That's about 0.5 point higher than are previous guidance, primarily due to a different distribution of pre-tax income across geographies. The adjusted effective tax rate in Q3 spiked a bit due to the year-to-date adjustment to the new higher full-year tax rate.","Free cash flow for Q3 was $267 million, another very strong result. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 123% in the quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 33.1%. A couple of items not shown, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 135.5 million, down about 3% compared to last year. Also during the third quarter, we repurchased 956,000 shares at a cost of about $115 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.65 million shares at a cost of $410 million. In November, we talked about a full-year repurchase target of $470 million. We're running about 16% ahead of that pace for June. At the end of the quarter, there was $642 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","Moving on to the next two slides which present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, both for the third quarter and year-to-date, I'll start with the architecture and software segment on page 5 and I'll focus my comments on the third quarter results. On the left side of the chart, architecture and software segment sales were $684 million in Q3, down 4.4% compared to Q3 last year. Organic growth was 3.1%.","Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 7.5% compared to prior year. Sequential organic growth was 1.8%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on the 3.1% organic growth, A&S margins were 29.2%, up 60 basis points compared to Q3 last year, with the volume leverage on organic sales growth and productivity partly offset by higher spending.","Turning to page 6, this is the control products and solutions segment, in the third quarter control products and solutions segment sales were $892 million, down 4.6% year-over-year on a reported basis, with organic growth of 1.6%. Currency translation reduced sales by 6.3%. ","Organic growth for the product businesses in the segment was 5.3%. Organic sales for the solutions and services portion of the segment declined by about 1%. The book-to-bill in Q3 for solutions and services was 1.1%, better than last quarter and a little better than Q3 last year. Sequential organic growth for the controlled products and solutions segment was 2.2%. CP&S delivered very strong operating margins at 16.1% in Q3, up 310 basis points compared to last year. In addition to the contribution from organic growth, year-over-year productivity was particularly strong in this segment.","Moving to the next slide, page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter in the nine months through June. Keith covered a good deal of the third quarter results in his comments. I'll maybe just add a couple of additional notes.","As you can see on the slide, the organic sales growth in the quarter was driven largely by the U.S. and EMEA, offsetting a continued decline in Canada and with Asia-Pacific and Latin America up only slightly compared to the same quarter last year. Canada was down almost 8% compared to Q3 last year. This region had the largest oil and gas exposure.","As Keith mentioned, the EMEA organic growth in Q3 was largely driven by the emerging countries. Emerging countries were up mid-teens with modest growth in mature Europe. In Asia, India grew double digits while China was flat as Keith said and mature Asia declined in the quarter. Our Latin America growth was 1.1% in the third quarter. Mexico experienced organic growth in the mid-teens but that was largely offset by declines in the balance of the region. As a final note on this slide, overall emerging market organic growth in Q3 was 5.8%, despite the flat China.","Please turn to the next page which is our updated FY '15 guidance. As Keith mentioned, we're revising the full-year guidance at the midpoint. We're reducing organic growth expectation for the full year by one point. Keith talked to those changes which are primarily related to the U.S. and China. We now expect a little less headwind from currency. Previous guidance called for the combination of currency translation and acquisitions to reduce sales by 5.8%.","We now expect that to be about 5.5%. We expect reported sales of approximately $6.4 billion at the midpoint. The previous guidance called for organic growth of 1.5% to 4.5%. The new guidance is for organic growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, a more narrow range with only one quarter to go in the fiscal year. Our operating margin performance has continued to be very strong through the first nine months and we expect that to carry forward into the fourth quarter. For the full year we now expect operating margin to be about 22%. That's a little above the prior guidance.","As I mentioned previously, we now expect an adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of 27%. That's up 50 basis points from the prior guidance. Given the lower organic sales, somewhat higher margins and a headwind from a higher tax rate, our new EPS range is $6.55 to $6.70. Higher margin is offsetting the lower sales.","We've remained within a couple of cents of the previous guidance midpoint, despite losing about $0.05 to the higher tax rate. Given our strong cash generation through the first nine months, we now expect conversion on adjusted income to be about another 110% for the full fiscal year. With better cash flow conversion and given that our year-to-date spending on repurchases was at a rate above our original full-year repurchase target of $470 million, we now expect to spend at least $525 million on repurchases for FY '15.","There are a few other items not shown here that I think are generally of interest. We expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $85 million for the full year. That's up about $5 million from the previous guidance. We continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 136 million for the full year and we expect process sales to be about flat on an organic basis for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick.","Patrick Goris","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we have quite a few callers in the queue today and we'd like to get to as many of you as possible. Please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Then you can get back into the queue if you want to ask another question on a different topic. Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question comes from the line of Scott Davis at Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Can you give us a sense, Keith and Ted, if you can separate out oil and gas as best you can? I know you said Canada is down about 8%. Can you give us a sense how much oil and gas you think was down and a little bit of forward look in that regard? If there's a book-to-bill or anything else you can share to help us understand how close we're to a bottom there?","Keith Nosbusch","Oil and gas in Q3 was down about 10% and we would expect for the fiscal year, it would also be down 10%, maybe a little bit better which gets us through Q3 down 7% on a year-to-date basis. I think it's a little too early for us to say that we know it's a bottom. Certainly, the next quarter will give us a good picture. If we're able to be steady state again in the third quarter I think we have our answer. It's become very mixed, however, as to spending.","Obviously, you picked up Canada. The U.S. is definitely down as well, but Mexico was up. The Middle East remains reasonably solid. What we're seeing is a transition into more OpEx spending than specifically upstream exploration spending. We're hoping that we can convert some of the production dollars in CapEx into OpEx as we go forward.","Scott Davis","Okay. I'm curious your views in China. You sequentially got more bearish. Some of the other companies have as well. What's your sense on the region? What I am asking, I think, really is that there was all of this hope there would be a secular shift from labor to capital that you would see more automation spend. It sounds like folks are so nervous about demand dynamics and just not wanting to spend. Do you see this more as a short-term issue? How do your local guys feel about the one, two, three year outlook?","Keith Nosbusch","We definitely feel that there is a short-term issue at this point, a lot of that driven by what's the liquidity. It's still difficult for small and midsized customers. The rates are still reasonably high. We had expected to see in China growth in the second half of the year which was not the case. Particularly, I think the currency is hurting a little bit. Their exporting OEMs are suffering because of that.","I think we have seen a pickup in some of the infrastructure investments, but that's typical China behavior. We believe the transportation industry, automotive is mixed with some of the leading companies still investing, but the slowdown in consumption is, I should say, in auto purchases is hurting.","The majority of the market, [indiscernible] is slowing because of overcapacity now. Yet we continue to see growth in the consumer industries, mainly the food and beverage areas, particularly with the concerns for safety and the ongoing expansion of the middle class which quite frankly, is why we continue to stay positive on China in the long term.","Certainly in the short term, there are spending concerns both from a company standpoint as well as individual standpoint. I think we have to see how the current phenomenon, the stock market transition the last couple of weeks, what will be the long-term impact of that as well.","Operator","The next question is from John Inch at Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.","John Inch","Obviously, all eyes are on 2016. For most of the companies, it's calendar, but in your case it's fiscal. What I would like to ask you, Keith and Ted, is as you literally add up all of these trends around the world, you are currently putting up very slow, low-single digit organic growth. It's actually better than lots of companies, but it's still pretty slow.","Do you see anything in your front log, your mix, your initiatives that prospectively should call for 2016 to be an improvement from that trend or perhaps even a deceleration in some manner? Obvious China is decelerating and it's a pretty important region for you. Then you called out EMEA improving. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like there's really nothing on a net basis, but you guys are insiders. What are you thinking there?","Keith Nosbusch","What we\u2019re thinking as we're going to reserve commentary on 2016 until November, so that's our first thought. To just to give you a little flavor for what currently is going on and that is our front log and quotation is stable.","I wouldn't say we're seeing a meaningful change in the activity. Obviously, the concern that we have talked about is the declining industrial production. That's been a pretty consistent drum beat starting in the spring time frame now, but when you look at the forecast for industrial production, it shows improvement as we go through 2016. I would say there's mixed messages at this point and that's one of the reasons we want to get a couple of more months here and get a better feel before we give our 2016 guidance.","John Inch","Keith, some companies, not against the quarters backward but looking, they have called out trends in the June quarter with very weak May and then an improving June, July. Did you see any of that? If so, was there in the commentary you can give overall about the way the quarter progressed?","Keith Nosbusch","The quarter did get stronger as we went April through June. June would have been the strongest month in the quarter. That, I guess, you could say would be the trend for the quarter.","Ted Crandall","Although, I would say that's pretty typical for us works for us.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. That's not unusual in our business. I would say that July with the holiday and everything started out slow.","John Inch","Just last, the commentary, Keith, I think is apparent for China. You have over the last couple of years put in through a lot of initiatives with lower-end product, as part of the bifurcation in the market right there between consumer and heavy industry.","Are you seeing and are you satisfied with the adoption rate of those lower-end microcontroller products? Obviously you're very strong in large controller. What's happening in smaller controller? Could that be a Rockwell specific source of improvement in 2016 in China, even if the overall market doesn't improve?","Keith Nosbusch","Certainly, we believe that is one of the areas that we should be able to grow in. That's heavily influenced by our success in the OEM market and that's what a lot of it is targeted for. I did mention OEMs were weaker, particularly exporting OEMs, because of the exchange rate, particularly into Europe.","I think our product portfolio continues to get better to serve that market. We call that the mid-range market and that's our controllers, our drives which is a very strong portfolio as well. That will continue to be an area that we expect better than market performance in China. Certainly, has been an area of focus for us this past year in particular. We've still got to get a better little traction.","Ted Crandall","John, at the risk of cutting that answer a little too fine, I do want to draw upon I think we have a better opportunity in mid-range and a larger opportunity in mid-range than in microcontrollers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan at UBS. Please proceed. ","Shannon O'Callaghan","Maybe just a quick margin question, obviously CP&S, really strong margins, you mentioned the productivity. It also looks like the product mix was favorable, but maybe just some more thoughts on why that came in so strong and if that productivity is sustainable?","Ted Crandall","Yes, so I talked about actions we took at the end of last year, some restructuring actions. That structural productivity contribution to CP&S is probably about half of the productivity that we're seeing in that segment and certainly, why that segment is running stronger than A&S. The other half is what I would call normal sourcing actions and lean and Six Sigma productivity projects that we always have in the pipeline.","I think we probably tended to underestimate a little bit as we have gone to this year the level of productivity we were driving in CP&S. I would say it's been stronger on the solutions and services side of that business than on the product side, but I do think it will be sustained. I think as we go into Q4 the margin comparisons get a little bit tougher, but I think we will sustain that productivity.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, the only comment I would make in addition is, I think we're also benefiting by the mix. As solutions grow at a faster rate going forward, that will have some downward pressure on margin.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then just in terms of when you look at verticals that are actually growing, what kind of investments are you seeing customers make? Our customers actually willing to make, it might not be capacity but a major redo a plant or whatever, are they willing to stick their necks out and make a real investment? Are these kind of smaller necessity kind of upgrades that you're seeing?","Keith Nosbusch","I think it depends on the geography. For example, the two verticals that are growing the best for us are automotive and then consumer. In automotive, there's a lot of greenfield investment, particularly in Mexico and a couple of the emerging markets, including China in that comment. In the mature markets, as you know in the U.S., the U.S. automotive companies are continuing to invest in new platforms so it's not necessarily capacity as much as new models and refurbishing their lines.","In particular, we see longer-term investment in the power train side of the business because of the fuel standard improvements that are mandated, new engines, new transmissions which you are now seeing. I think that would be the area that we see there.","With respect to the [indiscernible], it's pretty much the same story, emerging markets with the growing middle class and the greater need for automation and for protecting the safety of the product. We see more investments in automation. When we see it in the mature markets, it's really driving modernization of some of the new lines to update the existing installed base and also to deal with new, more flexible packaging to drive productivity. I think that's where we're seeing the greatest growth in those two verticals and it varies between mature and emerging markets.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Rich Kwas at Wells Fargo Securities. Go ahead, please.","Rich Kwas","Can you comment on the competitive framework in China right now? There's been one of your largest competitors out there saying that pricing has been more competitive there. What is your angle on that? What's your view at this point?","Keith Nosbusch","In China, pricing is always competitive but it tends to be the nature of the culture as well to some degree. I would say we're not seeing significantly different activities, but there is fewer large projects. I think on the few there are, what you traditionally see is a more competitive environment. I think that remains the case on the few large projects that are out there. I think that would include some of the infrastructure investments that our taking place. They tend to now require a more competitive bid.","I would say the area that is probably the greatest impact and it's not necessarily a pricing phenomenon, it's just a situation of currency which is the exporting Chinese OEMs are less competitive now because the RMB is pegged more to the dollar and therefore with the euro weakness against the dollar, the European OEMs our more competitive. That hurts the exporting OEMs in China, particularly into the European market. I would say that's not necessarily a pricing issue. It's more of a currency issued there.","Rich Kwas","You've seen the impact from that in the last couple of quarters that have been part of the slowdown?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, we have. I think that is part of it.","Rich Kwas","I guess this is a question for Ted, on the margins, if you back out FX you've got a very high incremental again. In the past, you've talked about organic growth having being in that mid-single digit range to get to that 35% incremental on an organic basis. How should we think about it as we move out the next several quarters in terms of momentum on productivity and how much that can help sustain the margin versus what you need in terms of underlying demand improvement?","Ted Crandall","I think I would still give the same guidance we have always talked about which is if we get organic growth falling into the low-single digits, it will be harder for us to drive conversion margins in the 30%, 35% range. I think what you are seeing this year is really a combination of two things. One is our productivity is above average this year. We've talked about that in previous quarters. The other thing is we're getting about 1% price this year on low organic growth. That also tends to help with the conversion margin.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Just a quick one, Ted, you had a very strong CP&S margin quarter here. Typically, you see a nice sequential ramp in the fourth. Just given the base level is higher here, how do we think about that just shorter term?","Ted Crandall","I think we're certainly going to see an acceleration in volume in CP&S just because fourth quarter is always our highest solutions and services shipment quarter. Normally, we would see some expansion of margin consequent to that, even though we're going to have a significant negative mix impact.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa at JPMorgan. Go ahead.","Steve Tusa","On that margin side, I guess just to ask the question a little bit differently as John was talking about in this low-growth environment and the trend for the second half of this year carrying into next year, can you still improved margins? There was such an amazing performance this year. I'm just wondering if your conversion is below the 30%, can you still improved margins in that environment?","Ted Crandall","Without talking specifically about 2016 because as Keith said, we're not giving guidance on 2016 yet, I would say generally our expectation is even at low levels of organic growth, 2%, maybe even 3%, 2% to 3% range, even at those levels we think we should be able to drive some level of margin improvement generally, but not the 30%, 35% conversion that we would expect at higher rates of organic growth.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Just to Mexico, how strong was Mexico? Then within Mexico on oil and gas front, should we think about Pemex there obviously? What's the flavor of the Mexico oil and gas strength that you're seeing?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, Mexico for the quarter was up, I think, mid-teens. That was, once again, a strong quarter of growth for us. When you were talking oil and gas in Mexico, you're talking Pemex. Of course, they have a supply chain there, but Pemex drives it. It's 100% of the business and they are continuing to invest and modernize. They are modernizing their platforms and also their transportation areas. That has been the area of growth as opposed to significant new drilling that's going on. We do see an opportunity with some of our install base to be able to participate in the upgrades and the modernization that's going on.","Steve Tusa","Okay. One last quick one, process for the fourth quarter, what you expect that growth rate to be for the fourth quarter for total process?","Keith Nosbusch","Process for the fourth quarter, we expected to be right around flat maybe a little negative, but overall for the fiscal year, flat.","Operator","The next question is from Richard Eastman at Robert W. Baird. Go ahead, please.","Richard Eastman","Keith, could you maybe speak just a little bit to the EMEA commentary. You mentioned emerging countries in EMEA were plus mid-teens. I'm curious. What is the industry exposure there and the market exposure, as well as which countries are you speaking to there?","Ted Crandall","Sure. We're speaking to Turkey. I would say the Middle East, when you think of the Middle East in my commentary, think of it as the oil industry in the Middle East which is now broader than just oil. Think of it as Saudi Arabia, the Emirates, Abu Dhabi. Then sub-Saharan Africa would be the other one and Central and Eastern Europe.","It's pretty much the rest of Europe, Middle East and Africa and we sold good growth. Other than Turkey in the quarter, we saw strong year-over-year growth. Actually, we also saw growth in Russia, but that was the delivery of a project. We're certainly seeing less opportunity with respect to orders. Once again, that's the lumpiness of our solutions business which is prevalent throughout that entire region.","Richard Eastman","Are the end markets, it sounds like spend, Middle East spend on oil and gas is still holding its own and the other markets slant towards consumer, food beverage, that type of thing?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, just to clarify the Middle East, the Middle East is expanding and other areas. Some of our growth there was in metals. Because of the low cost of energy, they do attract energy intensive industries. The other was in wastewater project as they continue to build infrastructure for their population. I would say oil and gas is the primary, but we had two very significant projects in metals and wastewater in the Middle East.","In the Eastern Europe, a lot of it does tend to be the consumer related industries, per your comment. When we talk about sub-Saharan Africa, it tends to be heavier in mining than anything else at this moment. The resource industries typically lead. We also see some consumer as the population growth is starting to attract some of the multinational food companies to invest.","Richard Eastman","Then a last follow-up here, Ted, when I look at the low end of the FY2015 organic growth guide, so the 1.5% core growth, as the fourth quarter plays out and the trend seems to play out, I suspect the A&S business would still trend line out at low-single digits through the fourth quarter, simply because it's got the consumer facing exposure and processor and auto. The CP&S when you pick up the all in gas exposure, the process, that could likely be a negative number in the fourth quarter year-over-year, despite the fact it should be up sequentially? Would that be the trend?","Ted Crandall","I do think our solutions and services business will be down slightly in the fourth quarter year-over-year. Our products business will be up.","Operator","The next question is from Jeremie Capron at CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Jeremie Capron","I wanted to follow-up on Scott's question around oil and gas. I get a sense from your commentary that you think we may be approaching a bottom at least in terms of year-on-year contraction. I think your guidance implies double-digit contraction in Q4 and then we will have to see what happens.","Wouldn't that be a rather weak down cycle here, particularly as you compare to what happened in mining? I think it took a good two years for your business to find a flow there? Do you think it's fair to assume that starting next year oil and gas would not be a major drag on your business anymore?","Keith Nosbusch","No, I don't think that's what I was trying to say. What I was trying to say is we aren't ready to call it stabilizing. We'll need at least another quarter to see if the declines that we saw in Q3 start flattening out or if we're going to see continued reduction in Q4. Right now we're calling, to your point, exactly right, we're expecting a double-digit decline in oil and gas in Q4 and depending on at what level that comes in, we'll have a better feel for going forward.","I do think to the point of your question, I don't think we will see a significant increase in spending until we see an increase in the price of oil. I think those two will be a very connected. At this point, I think we're still at too low of a level to see meaningful incremental investment, no matter where the bottom is. I think we still need to see higher oil prices to drive new investment, as opposed to just OpEx spending to improve productivity and their cost structure.","Jeremie Capron","Okay. And shifting gears here a little bit here, the free cash flow looks very strong, conversion rate, well above 100%. We've seen that for a few quarters now. Can you help us understand what is driving this and as a consequence do you see upside to your share buyback target that was set earlier in the year and I think you explained you're trending ahead. How should we think about buybacks going forward?","Ted Crandall","I would say the biggest factor influencing the higher conversion on adjusted income is better working capital management. Working capital has not increased at the rate we expected, despite the fact I'm talking on a constant currency basis, despite the fact we've had about 2% organic growth. That's the biggest factor.","As it relates to share repurchase, we originally set a target in November of about $470 million and as I mentioned in my comments, we now think we will spend at least $525 million this year. We ran ahead of pace through nine months and I think we will run at pace or higher in Q4. Obviously, that will depend on whether there's any acquisition spending in Q4 and also to an extent on stock price.","Operator","The next question is from Nigel Coe at Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Nigel Coe","I want to understand and maybe it's a dumb question, but when you say productivity, Keith and Ted, what you mean by that? Are we talking here about when the factory is more productively, especially cost control? What does that actually mean?","Ted Crandall","All of the things you've talked about. You can think about this in part as volume leverage that we're getting organic growth. You can think of it as lean and Six Sigma projects which are there to reduce costs, the efforts of our strategic sourcing organization to influence material costs. Margins in our solutions businesses which relates a lot to basically selection of projects and then the execution on those projects. In addition to all of that, savings we got from restructuring actions that we took late last year.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then digging down the next layer, we've got SG&A down 5%, just under 5% year-over-year which is slightly more than sales growth. Normally we would expect SG&A to be a bit stickier than sales. How does all of those actions you just referred to, how is that impacting SG&A line?","Ted Crandall","I don't think the actions we've taken have had a big effect on SG&A. I think what you're looking at in the 5% decline is more the effect of currency translation year-over-year. With that said, we've not had large spending increases either in SG&A.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Just final one, maybe I'm wrong but mining, I think last quarter you mentioned expectation of maybe some growth in mining in the second half of the year. It sounds like that's gone a little bit weaker. Is that fair? Maybe add some color to what you have seen on mining?","Ted Crandall","I think if we look at the year-to-date results, mining is actually slightly up for us year-over-year. The performance in any quarter is going to bounce around a little bit. I suspect for the full-year, mining's going to be either flat or slightly up for us this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker at Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker","Last quarter, you had talked about as part of the margin discussion, that spending was a bit slower in first half than originally expected, especially R&D efforts. I think you're up 2% compared to 4% you might expect in the second half on R&D. You talked a lot about this. Can you may be hit the R&D side a little bit? On all of the spending side, are you no longer anticipating bringing that up? What's going on with the projects?","Ted Crandall","Last quarter, we talked about spending up about 2% in first half and the expectation that it would be up about 4% and second half. We did not accelerate a lot of spending in the third quarter and we now think that our spending for the second half will be up about 3% instead of 4%. As part of the margin improvement that's reflected in the guidance.","Steven Winoker","Okay, all right. All of that's really coming in the fourth quarter now.","Ted Crandall","I would say, not all of it, but back weighted.","Steven Winoker","Quickly on the solutions versus services down 1%, obviously, I assume solutions was down significant and service is stable. Can you put color around that?","Ted Crandall","If I recall correctly, services was actually up year-over-year in the quarter. You are correct. The decline was all due to solutions.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Any number around that?","Ted Crandall","I don't know that offhand.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Keith, a bigger picture of your question, given the unique picture that you guys are in. What I'm seeing across the sector now, what's your view? I know it's a big question here, but what your view of world manufacturing, excess capacity and excess inventory? You've talked about automotive. You've talked about consumer a little bit. Are their particular spots where you think the world is in a significant excess capacity situation other than the oil and gas commentary in mining?","Keith Nosbusch","I think the one we've been talking most about, historically, is metals. I would say metals is still definitely in an overcapacity situation, particularly metals in China which has not reduced their capacity. You've seen capacity taken out of the U.S. and that's happened over a number of years. I still think we have overcapacity there. I think we're beginning to see, at least in China, some overcapacity in the tire industry.","They still have overcapacity in their overall automotive industry, but it tends to be in the domestic suppliers, the second and third tier automotive companies that are losing market share. Many of those are state-owned, so they are very difficult to close and to reduce.","But I would say that's where we've seen the overcapacity. I would think in most of the other industries, it's not an overcapacity situation. In the emerging markets, it's about creating capacity, particularly for the growing middle class and consumers. In the mature markets, it's about modernization and reducing cost and improving business performance and investments are going into that. An output of that would be some capacity expansion, but they are not making the investments due to capacity expansion.","I would say, if you take China in particular, independent of overcapacity, there is a need to deal with the escalating labor cost. That's just a natural tailwind for automation investment as well. We do see some benefit there, independent of some of the other comments I made.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","The first question, I just wanted to circle back the gross margin expansion you've seen and the extent to which you think that mix has been a help there this year or if you think the mix you've seen in 2015 is fairly typical, assuming no big changes in the overall demand environment?","Ted Crandall","I would say if you looked on a year-to-date basis, the mix is slightly favorable this year. It's had a small positive effect on margin. I think for the full-year, I'd expect that to be about the same.","Julian Mitchell","Understood. Secondly, I guess if you think about the appetite, the customer appetite around large project activity, if we exclude extractive industries for a second, metal, mining, oil and gas, how is the appetite for that kind of project spend changed? Is a very different versus three months ago? Your comments sound a little more cautious, but you have a decent book-to-bill.","Keith Nosbusch","I don't think large project activity has changed a lot in the last three months. I think one of the things we've seen is with industrial production rates slowing and that been true pretty much globally, maybe with the exception of EMEA, with industrial production rates slowing, what we're seeing is somewhat less MRO and small project activity.","Operator","Thank you. This comes from Robert McCarthy at Stifel. Go ahead, please.","Robert McCarthy","First and I apologize if you've already talked about it on the call, did you cite what the book-to-bill was for services and solutions was on the quarter and what Logix growth rate was?","Ted Crandall","Yes. The book-to-bill for solutions and services was 1.1 and Logix growth rate in the quarter was 3.5% organically.","Robert McCarthy","Do you have any outlook for what you expect the fourth quarter for Logix?","Ted Crandall","We expect Logix in the fourth quarter to grow less than 3.5%, but still positive.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then, the final question is in terms of Canada, in terms of [indiscernible], you have a big global balanced mix in terms of your productive capacity, but clearly the Canadian dollar has moved against you. Have you called out what kind of the headwind has been on transactional basis there?","Ted Crandall","No, I don't think we have. I don't think we have ever talked about specific currency transactional headwind.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Was it material or not? I guess it wasn't.","Ted Crandall","I'm stopping to think about it. We manufacturing in Canada and export to the U.S. and we also manufacture in the U.S. and export to Canada. I'm trying to think of what that balance will be.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. It sounds like it's relatively balanced. For some other industrials, they got nipped by that. Don't worry about it. I'll leave it there.","Keith Nosbusch","Okay. Thank you, Rob.","Patrick Goris","Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you."],"19085":["Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Q4 2017 Earnings Call November  8, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Blake D.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2017 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck.","This was another good quarter for us. Organic growth was about 6%, which was slightly above our expectations. I'm pleased to see that, once again, this growth was broad-based across both industries and regions.","Transportation had another good quarter, led again by automotive, which was up about 10%. In consumer, food and beverage continued to do well. Heavy industries were also up in the quarter, including good growth in semiconductor, chemicals and metals. Importantly, we saw oil and gas return to meaningful growth in the quarter. We had a strong finish to the year in orders, which were up high-single digits in the fourth quarter for the overall company.","From a regional perspective, the U.S., our largest market, grew almost 6% organically. We saw growth in almost all verticals, including strong performance in semiconductor, automotive and metals. EMEA was up 5% in the quarter, a nice finish to the year. We continue to make progress with OEM machine builders. Asia grew 5%, led by growth in semiconductor. China was up 6%. Latin America grew 2%, led by heavy industries.","I'll make a few additional comments about the quarter. Acquisitions added 1.3 points of profitable sales growth. Logix was up 8% compared to last year. Our process business improved, and was up 9% year-over-year organically. Including our MAVERICK acquisition, process was up almost 20%. We also had two specific items in the quarter that were not in our previous guidance.","First, we sold a small product distribution business that was part of our Control Products & Solutions segment. Second, we initiated restructuring plans related to manufacturing re-footprinting, as well as general cost reductions to redirect spend to our highest Connected Enterprise priorities. These actions accelerate our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Connected Enterprise strategy and further enhance the competitiveness of our products, services and solutions. We will continue to balance investments with our commitment to delivering profitable growth. Patrick will elaborate on our fourth quarter and full-year financial performance in his remarks.","Moving to the full year, overall, fiscal 2017 was a very good year for us. Here are some key points. Continuing several years of good growth, automotive had another strong year, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative and electrical vehicle activity. Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits led by food and beverage.","After a few down years in heavy industries, fiscal 2017 was a year of low-single-digit growth. We saw very strong performance in semiconductor and oil and gas improved over the course of the year. Logix grew 10% in 2017 and process also returned to growth. We saw good growth in revenue streams related to new value from the Connected Enterprise. Our pilots are progressing well and expanding in all industries. We'll talk more about this next Thursday at our Investor Day. Our customers and our management team will provide specific examples of how the Connected Enterprise is helping companies successfully compete by becoming more productive.","With respect to financial performance this year, we continue to make investments in the Connected Enterprise, including core offerings, information solutions and connected services. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion. We continued to return cash to share owners, over $725 million during fiscal 2017. Just last week, we announced a 10% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle.","Our recent acquisitions contributed 1.5 points of profitable growth and increased our technology, domain expertise and market access. We have a strong pipeline of both large and small acquisition opportunities and we have recently increased engagement with the start-up community.","During the year, we added more resources to focus on acquisition and investment opportunities. We continue to expect acquisitions to generate a point or more of growth each year. We also continue to leverage strategic partnerships, make targeted technology investments and gain access to emerging technologies to complement our own research and development activities. Our employees, partners and suppliers continue to differentiate us, and I would like to thank them for their efforts every day.","Let's move on now to the fiscal 2018 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Global macroeconomic conditions are solid. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates and PMI measures are at high levels. Our strong orders performance in the fourth quarter positions us well as we enter fiscal 2018. Taking all this into account, we expect another year of good growth in fiscal 2018 with continued growth in consumer and transportation and a meaningfully higher contribution from heavy industries, including oil and gas.","We expect our fiscal 2018 organic sales to be up 5% year-over-year at midpoint of guidance. The absence of the business we sold in Q4 will reduce growth by a little more than 1 percentage point, while currency is expected to add 2.5 percentage points to growth. Including the impact of currency, our fiscal 2018 sales guidance did sales of about $6.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $7.20 to $7.50. Patrick will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Patrick, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you next week at our annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Houston, Texas this year. This is a great opportunity to see how we are bringing the Connected Enterprise to life for our customers. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions and information solutions for thousands of worldwide customers, highlighting how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners brings the Connected Enterprise to life.","The opportunities for integrating control and information are greater than ever, and the value of the Connected Enterprise is being demonstrated across all of our verticals and around the world. I believe we are best positioned to deliver this value to our customers, because we are already on the plant floor, with a large installed base we have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships.","The value we provide is in high demand as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We'll continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share, more next Thursday during Investor Day.","Finally, I want to briefly address our announcement from last week regarding Emerson Electric's unsolicited proposals. As you saw, we issued a press release on October 31 confirming that Rockwell Automation had previously rejected two unsolicited proposals from Emerson. As we noted in the release, the Rockwell Automation board of directors carefully reviewed and evaluated each of the proposals in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, and unanimously determined that the proposals were not in the best interest of the company and its shareowners.","Rockwell is uniquely positioned as the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and information. We deliver applications across all industries and process hybrid and discrete on a single platform and one software environment, which is very attractive to both our customers and our distribution channel. We believe the company is well-positioned to create substantial additional value for our shareowners by continuing to execute on our strategic plan.","Over the past week, we have talked with many shareowners and analysts who are equally confident in the company, this team, and our ability to deliver additional upside and execute on our plan.","Our fiscal 2017 results and guidance for fiscal 2018 demonstrate the strength of our business and reinforce confidence in our strategy and that is where our attention is focused. The purpose of the call today is to discuss our results and next year's guidance.","Now, let me turn the call to Patrick for a deeper dive on our results. Patrick?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, key financial information fourth quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had good sales performance in the quarter with reported sales up 8.4%. Organic growth was 5.6%, a few million dollars better than we expected. Currency translation contributed 1.5 points to sales growth, also a bit better than expected. Our two acquisitions from last September contributed 1.3 points of growth.","Before I cover the other elements on this page, let me provide more detail on the restructuring charges in the quarter, as well as on the sale of the business Blake referred to in his comments, neither of which were included in our July guidance. We booked $43 million of charges in the quarter, all of which impacted segment earnings and margin. About half of these charges relates to a re-footprinting of our manufacturing operations. This includes the announced closure of our manufacturing facility in Aarau, Switzerland. This large re-footprinting will take several years to execute and is expected to yield attractive incremental earnings once finalized. We have successfully executed similar projects in the past.","The other half of the $43 million in pre-tax charges relates to general SG&A cost reductions in order to redirect spending through our highest priority areas, particularly Connected Enterprise-related investments.","We expect fiscal 2018 gross savings associated with the $43 million charges to be about $20 million. After taking into account further implementation costs for our re-footprinting, the net benefit to fiscal 2018 should be about $10 million. The net annualized run rate benefit is expected to be over $50 million once the manufacturing re-footprinting is finalized.","With respect to the sale, the business we sold was a product distribution business in the Control Products & Solutions segment. The business has no Rockwell intellectual property and includes products sold outside of our core channel and under different brands. We sold the business for $94 million with a potential earn-out on top of that. In the quarter, we booked a pre-tax gain of approximately $61 million associated with the sale.","Let me cover one other item that was not reflected in our July guidance and relates to the voluntary pension contribution we made during our fourth quarter. We decided to make a $200 million pre-tax contribution to the U.S. pension plan. A reduction in PBGC premiums made this financially attractive. With potential U.S. tax reform in the works, we decided to make the contribution now. Based on our most current projections, we do not expect mandatory contributions to the U.S. pension plan for at least five years.","With that, let's move on to the other elements on this page. Segment operating margin of 17% was down 280 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from strong organic growth was more than offset by higher restructuring charges, increased incentive compensation and higher investment spending. Adjusting for the restructuring charges, which as I mentioned were not part of our prior guidance, segment margin was a bit lower than expected due to currency. Currency translation was a slight tailwind to sales, but represented the headwinds to both margin and EPS in the quarter compared to our expectations.","General corporate-net expense of $24 million was a little higher than expected and about flat year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $1.69 was up $0.17 compared to the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 11%. The gain on sale and the restructuring charges combined yielded a $0.04 net adjusted EPS benefit. The remaining year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to higher sales, offset by higher incentive compensation and investment spending.","The adjusted effective tax rate of 25.9% was up 3 points compared to last year and includes U.S. taxes related to the gain on the divestiture. Excluding the $200 million pre-tax pension contribution, free cash flow in the quarter was in line with our expectations. 12-months trailing return on invested capital was 39%.","Let me add a few additional items not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.8 million, flat to last year. We repurchased about 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $34.6 million. For the year, we repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $336.6 million. This is a bit short of our $400 million target. At September 30, we have $608 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.","Moving on to slide 5, key financial information for full year of fiscal 2017. In short, we had a good year with 14% adjusted EPS growth on 7% higher sales. We talked all year about higher incentive compensation being a headwind to margin and adjusted EPS.","For the full year, incentive compensation was about $115 million year-over-year headwind. The higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges represented more than a 2-point year-over-year headwind to segment margin and had a significant impact on earnings conversion.","Adjusted EPS was $6.76. Excluding the Q4 gain on sale and restructuring charges, adjusted EPS of $6.72 ended up slightly better than we expected.","The full-year adjusted effective tax rate of 21.5% is a bit higher than the 21% rate we provided you last quarter, primarily due to the gain on the business sale. Free cash flow was 102% of adjusted net income. Excluding the Q4 items and the pension contribution, free cash flow conversion was 120%, which compares to the 115%-plus guidance we shared with you in July.","Moving on to slide 6, sales and margin performance of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had another good quarter with 8% sales growth. Organic sales were up 6.2% year-over-year. Currency translation increased sales by 1.6%, and acquisitions contributed 0.2%.","For the quarter, segment margin decreased 210 basis points year-over-year. Operating leverage associated with the sales growth was offset by higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges. And as expected, spending was up year-over-year, mostly driven by increased R&D.","Slide 7 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Control Products & Solutions segment. We saw another good pickup in growth in this segment with reported sales up 8.7%. Organic sales were up 5.1%, currency translation contributed 1.4%, and acquisitions contributed 2.2%. We had a second consecutive quarter of solutions and services organic sales growth up over 3%. The product businesses in this segment were up about 7% on an organic basis.","Operating margin for this segment contracted 330 basis points compared to Q4 last year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and restructuring charges, more than offsetting leverage associated with sales growth. The majority of the restructuring charges and higher incentive compensation affected this segment.","Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was 0.98 in Q4 compared to 0.92 a year ago. This is a bit stronger than usual performance in Q4. As Blake mentioned, overall company orders were up high-single digits in Q4.","The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of these details in his remarks. So I will just point out that growth was broad-based across geographies for both the quarter and full year fiscal 2017.","This takes us to slide 9, guidance. We project sales of about $6.7 billion, an increase of about $400 million compared to fiscal 2017. Organic sales growth is expected to be within a range of 3.5% to 6.5%. Consistent with currency rate projections for the next 12 months, we expect a tailwind from currency translation of about 2.5 points, and the sale of the business in Q4 is expected to be a little more than a 1-point headwind. We expect segment operating margin to be a bit below 21.5%. Excluding the impact of the sale of the business and the fiscal 2017 restructuring charges, this implies earnings conversion of about 35%.","We believe the full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be about 24.5%, a 3-point increase, mainly resulting from the discrete tax items we benefited from in fiscal 2017. Included in our 24.5% tax rate is an estimated impact of excess income tax benefits from equity-based compensation. Note that the 24.5% tax rate does not include any potential impact from potential U.S. corporate tax reform.","The adjusted EPS guidance range is $7.20 to $7.50. At the midpoint, this reflects a 9% increase compared to fiscal 2017 on 6% higher sales despite the significant headwinds from a higher tax rate. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be about 100%.","I'll add a couple of other items. General corporate-net is expected to be about $75 million for the full-year and we are targeting about $500 million in share repurchases and expect average fully-diluted shares outstanding to be about $129.3 million.","Page 10 shows an adjusted EPS bridge. My comments will be from the left to the right. As I mentioned earlier, reported fiscal 2017 adjusted EPS of $6.76 includes a $0.04 net benefit from the Q4 gain on sale and restructuring. Excluding that, we came in at $6.72 compared to our guidance midpoint of $6.70.","On 5% organic sales growth in 2018, we expect EPS contribution of about $0.70. And as we mentioned on prior calls, incentive compensation is not a headwind at the midpoint of fiscal 2018 guidance and instead represents a tailwind of about $0.10.","Currency is expected to yield a benefit of about $0.20. The sale of the product distribution business in the CP&S segment represents a loss of earnings of $0.05, and as expected, we see a significant headwind from a higher adjusted effective tax rate.","Finally, there is a modest benefit from lower pension expense, a couple of pennies, and lower share count. We project a smaller-than-typical EPS benefit from share repurchases, given the significant increase in our share price, which impacts the number of shares we repurchase.","Let me add that while we expect another good year of sales and EPS growth in fiscal 2018, we do not expect year-over-year EPS growth in the first quarter. We had an unusual low tax rate and lower spending in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and while for overall fiscal 2018 incentive compensation is a year-over-year tailwind, for Q1, it will be a modest headwind.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Boy, a bunch of things. I guess I'll try to keep it tight. First, just to better understand the quarter, it would be helpful to get some color on how the restructuring's set in the segments and how the FX played through the segments. Patrick you gave us a directional comment there, but to quantify that would be helpful.","And then maybe more importantly, I'll avoid the Emerson question, but not showing growth in the first half of 2018 even with the high tax rate sounds peculiar to me. Is there something other than investment spending that we should be thinking about in that regard?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. Jeff, with respect to the restructuring charges, you can think of the charges being a 60\/40 split, so 60% of the charges going to the CP&S segment, 40% of the charges impacting Architecture & Software, and so that's about a 3-point headwind to the CP&S segment margin in the quarter and a little over a 2-point headwind for the Architecture & Software segment in the quarter.","With respect to the question you had about fiscal 2018, my comments about no year-over-year EPS growth was with respect to Q1, not the first half of the year. So it's only for Q1 that we expect adjusted EPS to be down year-over-year for the items \u2013 because of the items I mentioned, but that is not for the first half. For the first half, we do expect EPS growth.","With respect to currency compared to the prior year, currency was about a 0.5 point hit to segment margin for the company and it was a little bit more than that for A&S and a little bit below that for CP&S.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. And then just as a follow-on, Blake, just to hit really kind of the strategic direction of the company and your push-back on Emerson and more importantly your view of the company going forward, do you, in fact, expect a much higher level of investment spending to execute on that? Is there anything unusual and what you plan to spend in 2018? And maybe just a little more \u2013 I'm sure we're going to hear a lot next week. But, just a little more about maybe what your customers are saying about your position and your business proposition.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Let me start with the last. Customers are voting with their wallets and that's why we're gaining share broad-based across regions and in industries. The Connected Enterprise and bringing it to life remains our strategy and that means that we integrate control and information across the enterprise to help industrial customers and their people be more productive, and that is what we do. We're a single integrated business, exclusively focused on that. We're the biggest company in the world that's devoted to industrial automation and information. And customers are telling us it's the right strategy.","I would add that it's very compelling to them to have such a tightly integrated business because it brings efficiencies to them as well as to us. Having a single platform within their enterprise to solve different types of applications is a huge productivity benefit to them. They can get lots of different products from different companies. But having a single platform with a common software environment is something that customers tell us, over and over, brings them a lot of benefit.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Let me start by asking, so we had this $0.28 gain and the $0.24 of charges. Patrick, what amongst these charges would have been normally run through anyway? Like in other words, I'm trying to understand, did you pull forward intended spending, or would you have spent this if you haven't had the gain? Like what \u2013 I'm trying to sort of \u2013 just kind of what's ultimately sort of a normalized versus unusual to kind of decipher how ultimately your business has fared?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. You can think of normalized restructuring charges for our company being in about $10 million per year, and we have, every quarter we have some charges. The charges that we just called out now would be on top of the normal $10-ish million we do. And so, obviously, a couple items played a role here. Obviously, we had the sale and the large gain who we've been looking for a while now at our supply chain and potential re-footprinting there. So we decided to pull that trigger. And as we mentioned in our comments, the other item is we're constantly looking at where we can redirect spending through our higher-priority areas related to the Connected Enterprise, and these restructuring charges enable us to do both. One is a long term re-footprinting; the other one is shorter term, redirecting some of our spend.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Let me also add and this goes back to the question that Jeff asked as well. Do we expect dramatically higher, unusually higher development spending going forward? And the answer to that is no. We continue to increase, as modestly as a percentage of total revenue, our development spend by working with the best partners in the business. By making acquisitions as well to complement our organic strategy, we're able to continue to keep spending at managed levels.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So, is it fair to say for the Swiss facility, et cetera, does the $43 million ring-fence this? Because I had sort of thought like you had intimidated that there was still going to be more of these initiatives that bleed into 2018. So, just to be clear and maybe you said it, but is 2018 back to the normal $10 million spending or is there a still incremental spending that's occurring without offsetting gain?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The normal $10 million, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So 2018 is the normal $10 million. Okay.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Why did China slow to mid-single digit? It actually seems that was probably the primary driver of your overall organic growth which you described as broad-based. It wasn't a bit better because, obviously, this was a strong industrial quarter, right, for \u2013 I mean Parker-Hannifin put up 7% core growth, et cetera. So, strong industrial quarter comes around the world. But in your situation, China was slower. What's going on there and what do you expect it to be doing in fiscal 2018?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that we always see some quarterly variability in our growth rates, especially in some of the emerging markets where there's some (33:18) more of the larger projects. We're pleased with our growth in China this year. China did about 12% of growth in fiscal 2017. And for next year, we expect China to be close to 10%, a little bit below. So I wouldn't just look at one particular quarter. I would expect some continued variability in those growth rates going forward as well.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I would also add. As some of the projects that get lumped into heavy industries come back, you're going to see some of that natural variability. So for some additional color, in Q4 in China, semiconductor remains at very high levels. Transportation continues strong, metals and mining. So a lot of that is project-based business and you're going to have some variability there.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The good news, John, is that as Blake mentioned, it's many different industries in China that are supporting growth. And so it's not only consumer, but some of the heavy industries are now contributing growth as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So basically, lumpiness. This is not some sort of a trend or some sort of share loss event or something like that. No. That's fine.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We think we've taken \u2013 John, we think \u2013 John, we think we've taken share in China.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Well, especially in consumer, I think that makes a lot of sense. Let me ask one last one here. Yesterday afternoon (34:43), Emerson laid out, I would say a strategic rationale for why they would really like to buy you. Basically, if you kind of read between the way they presented it, it was to plug their lack of discrete and hybrid offering. And they commented more than once that customers want this full automation solution across discrete, hybrid and process. I mean, I guess I'm wondering like you sort of answered Jeff's question by talking about how customers want sort of a singular provider. But the differences between true process and true discrete in terms of customer subset and skill sets are obviously pretty different. I'm just curious if you concur with Emerson's statement that increasingly the market is looking for a singular solution provider across all of these three disciplines, and if that were so, I mean your process business really isn't that big in the big picture. So I'm wondering if this strategically prompts you to in turn try and drive higher process penetration. Blake, I think you're on record as even saying you'd be interested in doing deals up to $1 billion or at least stepping up M&A kind of over time versus Rockwell's historical trend.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So, John, again starting with the appetite for acquisitions. We've talked about information solutions and connected services being priorities for acquisitions. And we've got a pipeline with some smaller ones and some big ones that get up to that $1 billion plus level. So we're looking at that. We start first with the strategic fit and then we look at the financial return for making those acquisitions.","In terms of what the market is looking for, customers are looking for a single platform that they can deploy across their enterprise and a lot of customers have a mix of discrete and batch\/hybrid and continuous process applications and the attraction of being able to build on our Logix platform to be able to solve all that different type of logic so that they only have to train on one platform their operations people. And from a parts standpoint and from a learning and an integration standpoint, that's very attractive to them.","So while we sometimes get caught up in looking at what pieces of the overall automation market can be used, what matters is the outcomes that you bring to a specific customer and that specific customer is looking for a single platform. That's why a lot of our investments are based on continuing to add functionality to Logix, to a common software environment and that's what customers, even continuous process customers are telling us that we're on the right path looking at.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. So you don't feel the need to step up the penetration incrementally based on kind of either the Emerson events or other events in the market to gain kind of more of a balance in process versus your discrete offering? I think that's what you're saying.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We continue to see process as a great growth opportunity. We combine what we have in terms of process control with our domain expertise because that's an important part of the equation, that was part of the rationale behind what has been a very successful MAVERICK acquisition. And something that we talked about a lot in the past is intelligent motor control. When you're talking about handling fluids, then the variable speed drives and the power control is an important part of that and we have as good a portfolio as any in the business and we're taking significant share there as well. So combining that with our improved process control capabilities is something that's allowing us to see the kind of growth we reported in Q4 in process.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. See you next week.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Blake, so another good year expected for auto. Just curious with the re-footprinting that's going on in the powertrain side across global OEs, shifting away from internal combustion, particularly diesel to hybrid and electric applications over the coming years, how do you see that playing out in terms of enhanced growth opportunity for Rockwell, and should we think of that as a potential more structural step-up to company's growth rate within that vertical?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Rich, we see it as very positive. When you combine the powertrain business that we've been talking about for the last few years as $20 million of additional revenue each year and you add the activity going on at many of those same-tier suppliers with electric vehicles, in 2018, we expect the contribution from powertrain and EV to be $100 million worth of business in our automotive segment. So it's big enough to be meaningful and we continue to see those high growth rates. We're competing and winning around the world at those customers. And that's definitely providing a boost to the traditional internal combustion assembly business that we've enjoyed for a long time in automotive.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that's incremental on top of what you would normally get, say nothing was really going on from a powertrain...","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Absolutely. I mean, three or four years ago, that was a zero.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Rich, our guidance for automotive \u2013 so continued strong growth in powertrain and EVs as Blake mentioned. Our overall auto business, we expect to grow below the company average in fiscal 2018.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Low single-digits.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Does that apply to consumer as well?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No. Consumer will be at about the company average and heavy industry would be a little above.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, as we think about the mix of sales just on an organic basis, as we think about heavy industry coming back and growing faster and that would imply more solutions-oriented revenues. As we think about that mix and the impact on incrementals as we go through the year, is there something we should be thinking about where maybe the early part of the year, stronger incrementals and the second half of the year moderates a bit? Any guidance there?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So Rich, our guidance assumes that our solutions and services will grow just a little faster than our product businesses. And when I say faster, it's like within a point or so of our product businesses. In terms of conversion, I would expect year-over-year earnings conversion to be stronger in the second half than in the first half, with some of the reasons I mentioned earlier impacting or related to the comparisons for Q1. So stronger earnings conversion in second half than first half year-over-year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So mix is not a big issue and it's really a comp issue in the first half?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Correct and yes.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Got you. Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Give us a sense of why you felt like you had to take investment spending up in Q4 and was it the strong order book that you saw and you just said you got to get ahead of this and add sales marketing or other kind of investments. Or was this \u2013 I'm just trying to get a sense of what was planned and what wasn't planned, because clearly it wasn't in most of our models?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Actually, Scott, the overall spending came in basically where we expected it to be. If we adjust our \u2013 first of all, our sales came in within a few million dollars. Our segment margin \u2013 adjusted for the restructuring charge of $43 million which was not in our guidance, segment margin came in where we expected, currency was a little headwind but basically was in line with where we thought we would end up being. And the net of it is that EPS was about $0.02 better than our midpoint of guidance. So there was no \u2013 let's put it this way, there was no decision during the quarter to just ramp up spending above and beyond what we assumed for Q4.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Yeah. was a little light (43:21) versus our models, maybe we just had it wrong. And then just getting back \u2013 and I don't want to beat the dead horse on Emerson, just trying to get some closure here. I mean is this kind of done at any price with \u2013 I mean if Emerson came back at a different price or a different structure, would there be a new process of \u2013 or is this just you guys have decided this is not the right partner and you just want to move forward? Just to be a little clearer on that.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah, Scott, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're here today to discuss our results and fiscal 2018 guidance. We're very confident in the company's strategic direction and in our ability to continue delivering superior levels of growth and value creation, and that's demonstrated today in the strength of our results and our confidence in our strategy and that's where our attention is being focused.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Yeah. I was just trying to figure if this is something we're going to be talking about through 2018 or if this is something that's kind of a dead horse and just move on. That's all.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah, Scott, we're not going to speculate on what Emerson Electric or anybody else might do.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Okay. I'll pass it on. We'll see you next week, guys. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you. See you then.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Blake, so you mentioned oil and gas markets improved pretty materially in the quarter. What do you think changed? Was it larger projects started to come back, and you mentioned that heavy industries can now grow clearly higher than the company average in 2018. Is that across the board including mining, chemical? I know you mentioned semicon and oil and gas.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. In general, we do see broad-based recovery in heavy industries, and we already saw pieces of that this year. We talked about the strong performance in semiconductor. We saw metals. Pulp and paper, while it's a small vertical, saw a significant growth. And now we're seeing oil and gas returning and it's a mix of MRO, as well as some larger projects. Obviously, natural gas continues to be an interesting part of that segment. And we see mining \u2013 we're seeing some renewed activity in Latin America, for instance, in the mines in Chile and so on as copper prices get up above $3. So we really do see that as a broad-based recovery across heavy industries, and we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of that.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Okay. That's helpful, Blake. And then, Patrick, I think you mentioned that solutions was going to grow faster than products in 2018. When I look at your two segments though, you have tough compares in both, but obviously strong order momentum going into the year. The CP&S actually grow faster than A&S as you go throughout the year given that solutions is pretty late cycle. And I think you mentioned 0.98 in book-to-bill and that might have been a little lower in solutions than you thought. But, obviously, there does seem to be a momentum there, so maybe you talk about that.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So, actually, we would expect \u2013 we expect both segments to grow at about similar rates in fiscal 2018. Solutions and services within Control Products & Solutions will grow a little bit faster than the products part within that segment. And then, what was the other part of your question, Andy?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Did you say book-to-bill was 0.98 and a little bit...","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","...weaker than normal seasonality.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No. Actually...","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Any color there?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. It was 0.98. That is actually a little bit stronger than typical for Q4.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Felt stronger than typical. Okay.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. It is.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Led by oil and gas and the heavy businesses?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. And as Blake mentioned, generally speaking, we had a good Q4 order intake. Our orders were up high-single digits for the overall company in the fourth quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Great. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Giordano from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Just wanted to start, if we could \u2013 I think you might have said this in the last question there, Patrick. But look, when I look at A&S growth trajectory into next year, kind of framing it with your guide, we're going to start getting into some pretty tough, like, I think in the first quarter you guys grew 8% and then 14% in the second quarter. So how does A&S kind of look through kind of as we pace out the year relative to your total guidance?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. So as I mentioned to Andy, we expect A&S to be about in line with the overall company in terms of organic growth. So that's about 5%. And you're right, the comps will get more difficult, but that's what we project for A&S. We expect continued growth as we said in consumer. Don't forget A&S also has exposure to heavy industries. Our Logix platform is sold in process industries and other heavy industries. And so we expect continued good growth associated with that.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then you mentioned the $100 million \u2013 Blake, you mentioned a $100 million contribution from powertrain and EV next year. Is that an incremental $100 million or what is that off of? Like, what was it in 2017?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The way you can think about it is that number about three years ago was probably close to zero. And so it is not an incremental 2018 versus 2017, but it is the growth that we have seen over the last two, three years and expect in fiscal 2018 that by the end of fiscal 2018, we think that EV and powertrain combined will be a $100 million business and basically, that's business that we didn't have three plus years ago.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And maybe with a little bit more detail on that. So when we started talking about powertrain explicitly as we reentered that market, we talked about around $20 million of incremental business a year from powertrain. As EV has grown very fast and it's many of the same customers, that's an additional boost to, again, a business that we didn't participate in that is basically growing market and our share over the last few years. And now, it's at that $100 million figure.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And Patrick just one quick clarification. On your tax rate guidance for next year, does that include or exclude, I couldn't hear before like the impact of or some estimate for stock option exercise?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It's inclusive.","Joseph Giordano - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. My first question just relates to the effective currency. Could you explain why currency was a headwind to margins in the fourth quarter and how it will affect your guidance in 2018?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. So every time we are in a quarter where we see significant currency swings, we get into balance sheet remeasurements, which may impact the performance of the OE impact of currency compared to what the top line of currency is doing. And that's why in Q4, whereas from a sales point of view, currency was a small tailwind. The margin and earnings impact was actually a modest headwind. For fiscal 2018, we're projecting a 2.5% sales contribution for currency and based on the currency rate as we see \u2013 and we used projections 12 months out, based on those currency projections, we expect about a 20% earnings conversion on the sales contribution from currency. And so that's why you get to the tailwind and EPS associated with currency that we show on the EPS bridge.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Great. Thank you. And my second question was just relating to Emerson if I may. I mean, are there assets within Emerson's automation portfolio that are attractive to Rockwell? And could an alternative transaction structure be of interest, versus the one proposed?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Justin, we're not going to comment on that. We're going to continue to focus on the Q4 results and the outlook for 2018.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we're going to take one more question.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much for taking my question. It's not an Emerson question, I promise. Connected Enterprise investments, I understand you're going to give a lot of detail on this next week at Automation Fair. But can you help us just understand a little bit those investments, how much investment we're talking about, really kind of thinking about this split between, say, R&D and growing the sales footprint? In other words, just kind of what do you need to accomplish to get Connected Enterprise growth on your target structuring (53:03)? Thanks.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. Well, Noah, let me start by saying the Connected Enterprise and bringing it to life for our customers is focused on producing outcomes for them that make them more productive. And so that's a combination of the technology and the domain expertise, and an overall approach to working with them as they go on their journey to add that additional level of productivity. It starts by putting the foundation in place where the data is born, so that's the smart products, that's Logix, which are fundamental parts of the Connected Enterprise. And so the investments that continue are to add more performance to Logix, to add more predictive analytics to PowerFlex drives, to more tightly integrate visualization with our logic-solving platform. All those things are fundamental parts of the Connected Enterprise, and that's where a lot of our spending has and will continue to go.","But it's also about the new value that we deliver from the Connected Enterprise. And so as we integrate control and information across the enterprise, we've got home field advantage. The data is born on our smart products that can be turned into useful information that helps these customers become more productive. So it's investments in information software, our own as well as the ability to integrate with other applications, because nobody has all the software under their own roof that's necessary, and because the technology moves too fast. And that's where our partner strategy is so valuable. It's also a focus area for acquisitions for us.","And as I mentioned, it's not just about the technology, it's also about the domain expertise and the support. All of the Connected Enterprise pilots that we're engaged in, that you'll hear about next week, and there's over four dozen of those that we're tracking, all of those involve engineering to complement the technology. And so investments in consulting services, in project management, all the things that are so important to make sure that the project goes right and that the value for the customer is maximized, those are parts of our investments as well. So all of that together, that overall approach is what customers are responding so favorably to as we bring the Connected Enterprise to life.","Noah Kaye - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Please turn to","page 3 of the slide deck.","I\u2019ll begin by saying that I\u2019m pleased with our execution in the quarter and our start to the year. Despite a","tough manufacturing environment, both revenue and earnings were slightly better than our expectations","for Q1. ","Total sales grew 3%, including over 4 points of contribution from inorganic investments primarily","related to our Sensia joint venture. Organic sales were down 1% compared to a strong quarter a year","ago. Backlog, however, was up year-over-year as well as sequentially. ","Organic sales performance continues to include market share gains in core platforms. For instance,","Independent Cart Motion Control Technology grew strong double-digits for us in the quarter. It is","becoming a game-changing solution across a broad range of industries and applications. ","Information Solutions and Connected Services, or IS\/CS for short, had another great quarter, also growing strong double-digits. We had notable wins in Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, our first MES win in Luxury Goods, a significant MES win in Mining, and our first-ever augmented reality project in Oil & Gas. ","Our broader and more differentiated portfolio gives us more ways to win in a wide variety of industries, including those where we are not the incumbent control platform. Recurring revenue in the quarter grew double digits, led by an increase in software subscriptions.","As I mentioned, our earnings performance was slightly better than expected. Segment margins and adjusted EPS include one-time items related to Sensia as well as investments we are making to","increase our long-term differentiation. ","As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2020. While there have been recent positive developments on global trade, and the macro environment is showing signs of stabilization, it is still too early to see that impact on customer spending. ","Let\u2019s now turn to slide 4 and go a little deeper into our vertical sales performance for the quarter. Discrete and Hybrid end-market segments did a little better than we expected this quarter while Process was a little weaker than we expected. ","Within our Discrete segment, Auto grew mid-single digits, largely related to higher program spend in North America and Asia Pacific, and stabilization in MRO, albeit at low levels. While this higher program spend was better than anticipated, the overall auto market is still relatively weak and we think it is premature to change our flat full year outlook for this vertical. ","Semiconductor sales were notably better in all regions, up high-single digits. Historically, our exposure to semis has been largely in facilities management, but we are also seeing new traction in material handling, IOT and cybersecurity applications.","Turning now to our Hybrid market segment. Food & Beverage declined low-single digits, reflecting some project delays. However, given what we are hearing from customers, and the activity we have seen at packaging OEMs, we still believe Food & Beverage will grow low-single-digits for the year.","In Life Sciences, we had another solid quarter, with sales growing both year over year as well as sequentially. As we\u2019ve said before, this is an industry where our scalable architecture and our differentiation in IS\/CS are well aligned and paying dividends.","Our Process market segment declined slightly, especially in Chemicals and Pulp & Paper. Organically, oil & gas grew mid-single-digits this quarter and we continue to expect low-single-digits sales performance for the year. Sensia, which had a good start to the year, is expected to grow double digits based on its differentiation in the fast-growing, digital oilfield segment of this vertical.","Turning to Slide 5 and our regional sales performance in the quarter. North America was down 3% organically, reflecting a weak manufacturing environment. The weakness in process industries was partially offset by Auto, up double-digits, and strength in Semiconductor. EMEA was up 2% in the quarter, led by Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Tire. ","Asia Pacific grew by 6%, led by strong demand for Oil & Gas, Life Sciences, and Auto. Auto was up over 10% in the region and included strong gains at EV battery manufacturers where our readiness to serve is high. Our portfolio is demonstrating how well-positioned we are to benefit from the transition to EV. Latin America sales were down 1%, largely due to a tough comparison from last year and weaker performance in Automotive and Mining. ","I\u2019ll now make a few additional comments on our other accomplishments in the quarter. Our Annual Automation Fair was held last November in Chicago, and I\u2019m proud to say that we reached a new all-time attendance record. Customers are focusing on outcomes, and sharply increased sales leads from the event indicate we are demonstrating our increased value for a wide variety of industries. ","We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There, we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner more flexible cost structure. ","We also had record attendance at our Investor Day in November. There we highlighted our execution plans to accelerate profitable long-term growth, while at the same time build even greater resiliency in our business through higher recurring revenue streams and a leaner, more flexible cost structure. We also had exciting new partners at the event, including Schlumberger, Accenture, and Ansys, which is a game-changing technology partner for simulation and digital twin applications. ","We are seeing our partnerships contribute to many strategic wins and we had some great wins this quarter, including in Life Sciences across all major geographies.","In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our PharmaSuite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. In Europe, we signed a major agreement with Roche. Roche will be implementing our pharma suite MES platform across 16 plants in their Pharma and Diagnostics divisions. ","In North America, we entered into a new multi-site, multi-year agreement with a major pharmaceutical producer. They selected FactoryTalk Innovation Suite to drive their Digital Transformation program for a connected plant and supply chain. ","It will provide a common platform to drive real-time visibility of analytics to the operator, plant and enterprise levels, predict future events to avoid unplanned downtime and improve energy efficiency, and accelerate knowledge transfer and improve ease of use. Once implemented, this solution will eliminate hundreds of overlapping edge solutions, resulting in significant operational savings. ","In China, Ruiying Pharma Group, a large pharmaceutical company, chose Rockwell to transform their factories to become smarter and more predictive, while at the same time assisting them to oversee quality management and ensuring that they comply with regulatory requirements."," From regulatory compliance, to safety and energy efficiency, Rockwell is becoming an increasingly important partner of our customers\u2019 ESG initiatives. In addition to what we are doing in our own facilities, everything we do for customers is about increasing efficiency, reducing energy usage, improving worker safety, and ensuring regulatory compliance, all of which lowers business risk and is good for the environment. ","Now, turning to slide 6, let\u2019s talk a little more about our inorganic investments which are becoming an","increasingly important complement to our long-term organic growth strategy. Starting with Sensia, this","was our first quarter including Sensia as a fully operational joint venture consolidated in our results, and I am very pleased with its performance in Q1. ","Operationally, Sensia\u2019s top line grew double digits with strong traction at marquis Oil & Gas customers around the world. Our sales teams have been fully integrated, and we are looking forward to the launch of new solutions and products that will contribute to the double-digit sales performance we expect this year. ","We also announced the acquisition of MESTECH at the beginning of Q1. MESTECH is an industrial software consulting and delivery services company based in India, and they have already been instrumental in winning key business for us in the quarter. ","Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Avnet Data Security, a cybersecurity provider based in Israel with over 20 years of experience. Cybersecurity is one of the fastest growing parts of our services business. The extensive knowledge and experience of the Avnet team will support our company's strategic objective to achieve double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services by expanding our IT\/OT cyber and network expertise globally. ","Plus, this acquisition will establish a global cybersecurity Center of Excellence for us in EMEA. This includes a remote managed service center and expands our portfolio of capabilities including a full training curriculum and labs.","As you can see, we are actively deploying capital to advance our strategic priorities to accelerate share gains in our core business, continue growing double digits in IS\/CS, grow domain expertise in process, and accelerate our market access in Europe and Asia. We are focused on driving value with more intensity than ever before. ","Let me now turn it over to Patrick who will elaborate on our first quarter financial performance and fiscal 2020 outlook in his remarks. Patrick?","Patrick Goris ","Thank you, Blake, and good morning everyone. ","I\u2019ll start on slide 7, First Quarter Key Financial Information. First quarter reported sales were up 2.6% year over year. As expected, organic sales were down 1%. Acquisitions, which mainly represent the impact of Sensia, contributed 4.5 points of growth, better than expected. Currency translation decreased sales by 0.9 points, a higher headwind than we expected.","Segment operating margin was 20.1%, down 270 basis points compared to last year. About half of the year-over-year decrease relates to the impact of acquisitions and related one-time costs, primarily Sensia. The other half of the year-over-year margin decrease is about evenly split between higher investment spending and unfavorable mix. ","General Corporate \u2013 net expense of $32.8 million was up $11 million compared to last year. The increase is due to the impact of mark-to-market adjustments related to our deferred and non-qualified compensation plans and Sensia-related transaction fees. ","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 7.9% compared to 18.7% last year. About half of the reduction in the year-over-year tax rate is due to a Sensia $19 million one-time tax benefit. The remainder is other discrete items, primarily tax benefits from option exercises. ","Adjusted EPS of $2.11 was a bit better than we expected, and down $0.10 compared to the first quarter of last year, a decrease of 5%. The year-over-year decrease in Adjusted EPS is primarily due to lower organic sales, particularly in some of our product businesses leading to unfavorable mix, and higher investment spending. ","Partially offsetting that is a lower tax rate excluding the Sensia impacts, and the net benefit of a lower share count and higher net interest expense. The net year-over-year adjusted EPS contribution of Sensia in the quarter was one penny. ","The Sensia contribution of one penny includes a $0.07 larger-than-expected headwind related to one-time items. Free Cash Flow was $194 million in the quarter, or about 80% of Adjusted Income. During the quarter, we paid the annual bonus that our employees earned in fiscal 2019. ","A few additional items not shown on the slide: for Adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 116.6 million, down 4.9 million or about 4% from last year. We repurchased about 0.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $100 million. This is in line with our full year target of about $400 million. At December 31st, we had $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization ","Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our operating segments. The Architecture & Software segment had modest organic growth in the quarter. Segment margin was very strong at 29.8% and a bit lower than the record margin last year, mainly due to increased investment spending. ","Organic sales of the Control Products & Solutions segment decreased 2.5%. Inorganic investments increased sales by 8.2% compared to last year. Sensia accounts for almost all of the inorganic growth. Organic sales for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was down about half a point year-over-year. The higher margin product businesses in this segment were down about 5% on an organic basis.","First quarter organic book to bill performance for our solutions and services businesses was 1.12, typical for a first quarter. Operating margin for this segment of 12.4% was down 310 basis points compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to Sensia one-time items, lower organic sales, and unfavorable mix. Segment margin excluding the year over year impact of Sensia was about 14%. ","In the appendix, you will find two slides with a more detailed overview of the year-over-year incremental impact of Sensia for Q1 and for full year fiscal 2020 outlook. It is the same format we provided to you at our investor day. ","As I mentioned earlier, from an operational viewpoint, Sensia sales and earnings were a bit better than we expected. Non-recurring items, including the tax benefit, were $0.07 worse than we expected in the first quarter, primarily due to larger purchase accounting adjustments and a lower tax benefit. For full year fiscal 2020, we now expect the net year-over-year impact of Sensia to be about neutral to adjusted EPS.","The financial framework we shared with you at investor day last November remains valid with Sensia. We continue to target 30 to 35% earnings conversion for Rockwell assuming mid-single-digit organic sales growth. ","This takes us to slide 9, guidance. Our outlook for fiscal 2020 remains unchanged compared to our November guidance. We are maintaining our sales growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. For adjusted EPS, in essence, compared to prior guidance, small headwinds due to Sensia one-time items, currency, and a higher share count are offset by a somewhat lower adjusted effective tax rate. The lower tax rate is the result of a higher excess income tax benefit related to share-based compensation.","General corporate net is now expected to be closer to $105 million. Purchase accounting amortization expense for the full year is expected to be about $40 million, up $20 million compared to last year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2020 is still expected to be about $100 million. We expect non-controlling-Interest to be about $10 million, or a $0.10 charge to Adjusted EPS.","Average diluted share count is now expected to be 116.5 million for fiscal 2020, and our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be closer to 15.5%, which includes about a 150 basis point one-time benefit related to Sensia. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income.","Finally, we continue to project a weaker first half of the year, with organic sales down low single digits, followed by a stronger second half of the year. And as is typical for us, we expect weaker 2nd quarter Adjusted EPS performance versus the first quarter. ","With that, I\u2019ll hand it to Jessica to start Q&A. ","Jessica Kourakos","Thanks, Patrick. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you in as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Sharon, let\u2019s take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning everyone. This is Joe on for Julian. ","Blake Moret","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe can we start with diving into backlog trends? Can you maybe just provide some color on what drove the sequential rise and the year-over-year rise? And then, maybe within that, anymore details on Solutions and Services?","Blake Moret","Sure, how much more color we can provided except that as we mentioned, backlogs are up both year-over-year and sequentially, and I would say it was broad based including in North America. ","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you. And then, at the end-market level, kind of on the mid-single-digit growth for oil and gas, was this on kind of company-specific drivers, maybe share gains? Or are you seeing kind of more positives in the end-market as a whole?","Blake Moret","On the organic side, there obviously has been a flattish capital spending and we do see a slower \u2013 a slowing of the oil and gas organically. However, on the Sensia joint venture, because the majority of that is focused on producing wells and not drilling new wells, we see it less susceptible to CapEx reductions and that gives us confidence based on our first quarter results and the outlook that double-digits impact part of our overall oil and gas business can take share and grow fast. ","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Blake Moret","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. ","Karen Lau","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Karen Lau dialing in for John. ","Blake Moret","Good morning, Karen. ","Karen Lau","Good morning. So, thank you for the details on Sensia in the appendix. I was just wondering in terms of the core margins, it looks like, you guys were making 18% core margins excluding the one-time items in the first quarter, but then in the full year you are guiding to around 14% margins. What is the driver of that?","Patrick Goris","Yes, what you can think about it, Karen, what you see in the appendix is the year-over-year incremental piece of Sensia. It\u2019s the impact of the contribution of Schlumberger, which was higher margin business than what we contributed. ","Karen Lau","Okay. ","Patrick Goris","And so, therefore, when we talk about overall margin profile of Sensia, we do expect that the 20% EBITDA business going forward. But this year, we think it will be closer to mid-teens. ","Karen Lau","Okay. But is it \u2013 I mean, am I reading correctly that the first quarter results were better than what you were expecting for the full year? Or is that like some\u2026","Patrick Goris"," But the piece that was contributed by Schlumberger and the synergy, the answer to that is, yes. I would also say that our spend increased in Sensia, because we are making some investments in technology and commercial resources. They were a little bit lighter in the first quarter than we expected. That\u2019s why you see that margin in Q1 being a little bit better, as well than what you see for the full year outlook. ","Karen Lau","Got it. And then, just quickly, can you remind us what\u2019s your expectation for investment spending for the year? And kind of the cadence throughout the year?","Patrick Goris","Yes, the way you can think about it, Karen is, consistent with what I mentioned to you in November. We think the year-over-year increase will be a little bit less than a 2% and it will be first half weighted. And so, we expect it to be more than that in the first half and in the second half, the increase year-over-year will be minimum in terms of year-over-year spend.","Karen Lau","Got it. Thank you. ","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Karen. ","Operator","Next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. ","Robert McCarthy ","Hi, it\u2019s Robert McCarthy on for Robert McCarthy. ","Blake Moret","Hey, Rob. ","Robert McCarthy ","How are you doing? So, in any event, just wanted to first, I mean, obviously wasn\u2019t \u2013 it\u2019s very dynamic situation right now. You had the trade deal. You had very encouraging quarter, but obviously you had this rising potentials of pandemic, and then I want to get too much of a Debbie Downer. ","But how do you think about kind of your supply chain in China, how do you think about, kind of the trends in spillover? I know it\u2019s very early and you don\u2019t have a lot of information yet, but could you just give us some factors to think about and what sensitivities you are looking at in terms of exposures as you manage to this situation? ","Blake Moret","Sure. Well, first of all, Rob, the overwhelming first priority for us is to ensure that we are looking after our people in the region. And so, we are paying close attention to that to make sure that we can reduce to the very extent possible their exposure. ","Second, and on a parallel path, we are undergoing a detailed review of our own manufacturing footprint, as well as our supply base to gauge the potential impacts. At this point, we don\u2019t expect an impact to the quarter\u2019s performance, but as you said, it\u2019s a very dynamic situation and we are monitoring it hourly and looking for new inputs to help inform how we feel about the business impacts. But it\u2019s the safety and well-being of our employees first. ","Robert McCarthy ","Thank you for that. And then, I guess the follow-up would be, maybe just a little more color around Information Solutions and Connected Services, the continued double-digit growth there. Can you talk about, kind of the continued developments and collaboration with PTC, some of the wins and maybe expand your comments around augmented reality? And I don\u2019t know track and trace is something that\u2019s started to pick-up there or is looking to be encouraging.","Blake Moret","Yes, Rob, it\u2019s a great story for us and with our own offerings that we\u2019ve developed ourselves, plus with partners like PTC, the Information Solutions and Connected Services part of our offering continues to grow strong double-digits and we are seeing that it\u2019s a true differentiator in some of the fastest growing parts of the overall automation market like electric vehicles and life sciences. ","So, it works perfectly to complement the basic automation that we are providing in those industries whether it\u2019s discrete automotive assembly or it\u2019s process control for pharma, but as they are looking for more traceability, as they are looking for adding the ability to transfer knowledge from older workers to newer workers, augmented reality is a great part of that. ","We have mentioned before, about a third of our sales of the software in this space include augmented reality. So it all works together. It\u2019s increasing the hit rate for our MES software, because we have a broader portfolio and it works together well. So, there is a lot of positives in this respect. And I should mention it\u2019s not just for end-users. ","It\u2019s also for OEMs, because they are looking for increasing the value of what they are providing and as they look for ways to increase their flexibility getting closer to that zero changeover time for packaging that is hard in the industry today. ","Then this has a lot of benefit for them, as well. We had a win in the quarter with Harpak, who you heard from us at the Investor Day in November as they are adding that software to the basic logics control and variable speed drives and so on as part of the basic automation of those systems. ","And then as a final point, we have seen, probably a higher degree of adoption of this software on top of competitive control platforms than we originally thought would happen. ","Robert McCarthy ","Thanks for your time. ","Blake Moret","Thanks, Rob. ","Patrick Goris","Thanks, Rob. ","Operator","Next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. ","Richard Eastman ","Yes, good morning. Thank you for the questions. Blake, could you kind of speak, maybe to the geographic mix, the organic growth by geography in the quarter? And it just \u2013 it seems a bit scattered here. I mean, I presume, Asia was probably better than expected. U.S. maybe a little bit weaker. But how does the incoming backlog being up quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year? ","How does that filter into maybe the geographic growth that you expect for the full year against the \u2013 kind of that midpoint of flat expectation for all of Rock?","Blake Moret","Yes, let me start with a couple of comments and then Patrick may have got some additional color on that. But as I said, Asia was better than expected. Latin America was worse than expected. North America and EMEA were pretty much in line with expectations. In North America, as we mentioned, we were down by 3% and that was largely due to declines in more process-oriented verticals with the exception of oil and gas. ","So, we saw chemical, pulp and paper and metals, and then that was offset by the growth we mentioned in automotive, power and semiconductor. EMEA was up and oil and gas was a contributor there along with a recurrent theme of life sciences. Waste water was a good area for us in EMEA and in Asia, we were up with growth in oil and gas, life sciences, auto, tire and mass transit. ","And then, LATAM was down a little bit where weakness in auto and mining was partially offset by growth in power, oil and gas and life sciences. So, that was kind of a rundown of what we saw in Q1. In terms of how the backlog feathers into that, obviously, mainly project, but also with some of the higher value services as well, particularly those included with the Connected Services part of IS\/CS. ","Patrick Goris","Rick, maybe a little bit of color as to our assumptions by region for the full year. So, organic growth at the midpoint is flat year-over-year. We expect both the \u2013 both North America and EMEA to be a little bit below that and we expect both Latin America and Asia to be up a little less than 5%, about mid-single-digits. ","Richard Eastman ","Okay. And \u2026","Patrick Goris","So, what - but that inflected as we expect in essence better than our guidance, we expect second half of the year as I mentioned improvement and that includes the U.S., I would say, North America. ","Richard Eastman ","Okay. And was there any noticeable impacts on the backlog and order flow around passage of the U.S. MCA when you are talking about Latin America and Mexico? Was there any noteworthy improvement in bookings or anything once that uncertainty was more or less lifted?","Blake Moret","Not yet, is the short answer. I mean, it\u2019s a positive step and supporting the concept of free and fair trade that we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past. So we think it\u2019s a good thing. But we haven\u2019t seen the results on outperformance yet. ","Richard Eastman ","Okay. Very good. Thank you. ","Blake Moret","Thank you. ","Operator","Next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.","Noah Kaye ","Thank you. t I was intrigued, Blake, because you call out ESG as a potential driving force for your customers to implement your suite of offerings. Conceptually, I think we can understand that, there is a basic efficiency play here that plays in ESG. Could you maybe provide some examples of where you are seeing that make a material difference in customers\u2019 decisions?","Blake Moret","Well, as you said, everything we do is about productivity and a huge part of that productivity is efficiency. So, you take our power control offering, variable speed drives, which reduce dramatically the amount of energy that\u2019s required to run industrial processes, tremendous amount of the world\u2019s energy is consumed in factories and simply, not running full across the line when you don\u2019t need it saves a ton of energy and our variable speed drives, low-voltage and medium-voltage continue to be a very strong part of our offering. ","Specifically, in the new eco industrial segment that we introduced in November, talking about our support of renewable of water and waste water treatment and mass transit, those are all industries that reduce the amount of energy that are required and it was no coincidence that we created that new segment, because we are going to be doing more in that space. ","And then finally, safety, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve talked a lot about in the past and in terms of the technology to be able to automate safety, but also the services that we provided, that\u2019s an important part of ESG. We think that we are number one in the world when you pull all the discrete and process safety technology together, and that remains a really important area for us. ","Noah Kaye ","That\u2019s helpful. And then, maybe drilling into auto a little bit, as you said it surprised the upside, and you gave some good color around some regional patterns there in your prepared remarks. ","But just, the outlook for kind of, soft overall light vehicle demand, is that having any impact as far as you can tell on kind of the backlog the longer cycle business in terms of OEM plans to bring new models to market or planned model changeovers? How are you thinking about that? ","Blake Moret","Well we \u2013 we are guiding to about flat currently with the auto - overall automotive segment for the year. I\u2019d say the growth is highest in the specific EV drivetrain portion of the segment as people have bring in that capacity online whether it\u2019s the brand owner or it\u2019s the tier supplier, and by the way that contributed a lot to our performance. ","That was a little better than expectations and if you want it was battery assembly that was a specific bright spot for there. That\u2019s offset to some extent by the reality of a weaker star count for fewer vehicles than we saw a couple years ago being bought. Certainly, a lot of the brand owners are reducing their Sedan portfolio. ","But there is still a fair bit of project spend there and in the - particularly in the SUV side of things. And the growth that we saw in the quarter was primarily due to project spend, MRO stabilized, but we didn't see any real growth in MRO in the quarter. ","Noah Kaye ","That's helpful color. Thanks, Blake. ","Blake Moret","Yes. Thanks, Noah. ","Operator","Next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. ","Steve Tusa","Hey guys. Good morning. ","Blake Moret","Good morning, Steve. ","Steve Tusa","Can you just talk about a little bit more about what you're seeing on the food and beverage side and OEM? And then on maybe just a bit of color on how you see, kind of quarterly organic progressing maybe move through the rest of the year?","Blake Moret","Sure, I'll start with the food and beverage. We did see some delays in food. But one of the bright spots and I mentioned it is, we actually saw mid-single-digit growth in packaging OEMs. And it\u2019s early but that\u2019s sometimes a leading indicator as people are putting packaging in place and we did see that across the regions. ","We also heard anecdotally from the packaging OEMs that their backlog is fairly good. And so those are encouraging signs. One area of particular strength for us \u2013 it\u2019s small but it is still noteworthy India packaging OEMs and I say it\u2019s is noteworthy because India maybe the most competitive market in the world and for us to have a success there is a really younger testament to the functionality and the ability to get to competitive levels there. ","I was actually there in visit with some customers including some packaging OEMs in December. And I think there is some great opportunities there and we are going to continue to look at what we can do to grow our presence even faster in the Indian market. But in general, packaging OEMs were up. ","We also saw some strength, specifically in beverage. We had a real nice conversion at a beverage OEM that\u2019s going to a well-known beverage user and so that was also good in the quarter. ","Steve Tusa","And then you said, quarterly, yes, progression on organic?","Patrick Goris","Yes, see, for the full year, we remain at 0% organic growth. Obviously, Q1, we did minus 1. I would say, Q2, low, low-single-digits, meaning it\u2019s close to what we did in Q1. We don\u2019t expect it to get worse than what we did in Q1 and then for the balance of the year, I\u2019d say, Q4 organic growth a little bit better than Q3. ","Steve Tusa","Okay. So, it seems to me that like, how do you get to kind of the low-end of the range than if that\u2019s the case? I mean\u2026","Patrick Goris","What I was providing was at the midpoint, Steve. ","Steve Tusa","Yes. Okay, got it. ","Blake Moret","The trend that I think we have seen in the past with chemical and we did see that is the single largest contributor in the quarter. That was primarily in North America, we actually saw an increase in chemical in EMEA, down in Asia, and slightly down in Latin America. So, is it\u2019s offset? ","As we mentioned, we actually saw a growth in oil and gas, but the chemical was down in the quarter and most of that was concentrated in North America.","Steve Tusa","Thanks. ","Patrick Goris","As we said in the earlier, within Process, oil and gas was up. But generally, process industries were weak in the quarter. ","Steve Tusa","Great. ","Blake Moret","I would also mention, just for background that, in chemical lot of our exposure in specialty chemical. It\u2019s not as much in the bulk chemical. That\u2019s our traditional focus. There is some overcapacity that we are currently seeing in chemical and some effects from some of the consolidation that\u2019s been going on in the industry over the last couple of years as well. So that\u2019s some additional color that would certainly apply to North America. ","Steve Tusa","That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then just a quick one just on EV. I know, you said you had strong gains there during the quarter. I am just wondering if you can talk about China EV specifically and what you have been seeing there? Any changes? ","Patrick Goris","Yes, so, China \u2013 auto in China has been down Q3, Q4 of last year and we saw that continue into the first quarter of fiscal 2020. And that includes EVs. And so we are seeing some of the support or the subsidies go away in China and generally, and obviously it\u2019s still a little bit lumpy, because it\u2019s relatively small, ","But EV and auto in general, we are certainly seeing some weakness in China. Interestingly, auto in Asia was up for us quite a bit and the reason there we are making some progress with some of the EV companies outside of China including some companies in Korea for example. ","Blake Moret","Yes, and that\u2019s specific application that Patrick is mentioning in Korea was the battery assembly, which is a great application for us. We have mentioned before that, in comparison to the subtractive manufacturing processes for internal combustion engines, now for boring cylinders and things like that that require a lot of CNC content. Battery assembly and motor winding and EV drivetrain, we have a high readiness to serve there and that\u2019s why we think that long-term EV is a great market for us to be in. ","Steve Tusa","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much for your time. ","Blake Moret","Yes. Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Josh Pokrzywinski ","Hi, good morning all. ","Patrick Goris","Good morning, Josh. ","Blake Moret","Hey, Josh. ","Josh Pokrzywinski ","So, apologies if I missed it earlier on the call. But, Blake, one thing that we talked about at the Analyst Day that I want to see how that is playing out is, it\u2019s kind of the lower cyclicality of Rockwell maybe versus what folks would have been accustomed to five or ten years ago or even more that it does seem like at a point in time whether folks are seeing kind of a more depressed outlook that Rockwell is hanging in there a bit more stable. ","I guess, one, is that consistent with the way you guys are seeing the world? And two, is there kind of a coiled spring on the back-end where you can see customers have a willingness to spend on projects, but there maybe not executing it. So, have we lost some of that upward mobility in exchange for lower cyclicality? ","Blake Moret","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t draw that the causality between the two. But as we talked about a lot in November, that greater resiliency to economic cycles is something that we are making very explicit steps to address. And so, in addition to things like Information Solutions and Connected Services providing a lot of increased value to customers and pulling through some of our traditional products. ","It does have an impact that we think is already being felt in terms of kind of clipping the trough of some of the normal volatility. Now it\u2019s still a relatively small part of our business, right? But that\u2019s compounding a strong double-digit growth, plus what we do with acquisitions having more recurring revenue makes it more important each year and last year. ","We think \u2013 for instance, Information Solutions and Connected Services having about a point of organic growth to what we did and you know in a relatively low growth year overall, that\u2019s meaningful. ","So, we are going to continue to work on that in terms of both our organic development, the products and the environment to be able to manage recurring revenue. But it\u2019s also a consideration as we look for companies to acquire and the percentage of recurring revenue. ","Josh Pokrzywinski ","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a follow-up on investment. Again, apologies if you covered already. It seems like some of that got pulled forward into the first quarter as maybe demand was a little bit better than expected. ","How should we think about the sensitivity from here on kind of that full year investment budget? Is it at a healthy level to where if you are at the top-end of the revenue range that the overall bucket doesn\u2019t increase? Or how are you thinking about the sensitivity over the remaining three quarters? Thanks. ","Patrick Goris","Yes, Josh. So, what we mentioned was that the spending in the \u2013 the year-over-year increase in the first half will be higher than in the second half. Actually, the second half the way we have it dialed in now is the flattish from a year-over-year spend point of view. However, if, depending on what happens with our outlook for the year, and if we end up doing better what we do at the midpoint. ","Clearly, we could decide to release more investments. There is a very long list of attractive investments that we are looking through all the time and we could decide to do more. ","Josh Pokrzywinski ","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Patrick Goris","Thank you. ","Operator","Next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe ","Thanks, good morning. Appreciate the question. I know you covered a lot of ground already. But and I know we tend to focus more on the end-market out. So I am just wondering about the geographies and thinking about how geographically, things are playing out relative to your initial kind of guidance in November. In particular, North America, down 3.3% this quarter and I know that North America has been trending weak for some time now. ","But with ISM where it is and IP negative, how does that look in North America specifically compared to your initial kind of outlook? And kind of what\u2019s bouncing against that if it is weaker than you expected?","Blake Moret","Yes, so, as you said, the macro can generally be characterized as weak and there was some downward revisions. And our position to that is some of the backlog that was built in the first quarter and some of the things. ","Again like the IS and CS, the Information Solutions and Connected Services backdrop aren\u2019t going to be as coupled directly to some of the broader indicators, if in those areas, we can demonstrate a relatively quick return on that investment, which is often from OpEx then we think that that\u2019s going to be more resilient than some of the other more capital-related spending. ","Patrick Goris","Yes, and then, Nigel, for Q1, we would say that North America and EMEA came in basically in line with our expectations. Asia-Pacific came in better and Latin America came in weaker. And for the full year, compare estimate point, we think that North America and EMEA will be down a bit and we think that Asia-Pacific and Latin America will be up mid-single-digits at a less than 5%. ","Nigel Coe ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Patrick. And then a quick one on obviously A&S is holding up a lot better through the soft patch than we\u2019ve seen historically. And I know it\u2019s also flowing through the IS layer, but can you just maybe \u2013 is there any way to quantify kind of the relationship with PTC and how that\u2019s helping to \u2013 maybe improve the trough performance of A&S? And any color there would be helpful.","Blake Moret","Yes, I made a general comment to that and that is, manufacturing - advanced manufacturing is becoming a much more noteworthy part of a company\u2019s overall digital transformation plans. So we see companies like Stanley Black & Decker, as they talk about fairly significant reductions in cost they're being asked to go a little deeper and explain how they are going to get there and we are finding ourselves apart of those explanations as to how we are going to be able to reduce OpEx for these companies. ","By having the relationship with PTC and having that increasingly important in IS\/CS offering, we are going to have those broad discussions at a higher level than if we were just talking about programmable controller performance or some of the other elements of basic automation. ","So it allows us to get higher in the organization and deploy a meaningful part of those overall discussions whereas if we didn\u2019t have that kind of breadth, then we might find ourselves playing a little more deep ends in some of the core components. ","So that\u2019s at a high level how a partnership with a company like PTC will pull through some performance in the core products, because they all go together, that basic automation and then the information that sits on top of it to draw insights from the data that\u2019s born in our products. ","Nigel Coe ","Okay. Thanks, Blake. ","Blake Moret","Thanks, Nigel. ","Jessica Kourakos","Sharon, we will take one more question. ","Operator","We have a question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Hey, good morning guys. ","Patrick Goris","Good morning, Andy. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Thanks for letting me in. Blake, you might have talked about this earlier, but on Sensia, you mentioned that operating performance was better than expected. Maybe you could just talk about \u2013 give a little more color on what that means? Obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces with Sensia in the guide that you gave last quarter for the year. ","I think you talked about $0.05 excluding interest. Could it be better than that in 2020?","Blake Moret","Yes, I mean, we are pushing the team, obviously to perform as if they are in an open field because we think they are. We think that what they are offering is somewhat unique in the market and our original hypothesis that there was a low level of basic automation in the oilfield, particularly the onshore oilfield is proving to be true. ","So that things that we are talking about as we are selling the traditional offerings into that space of things like measurement, devices, as well as artificial lift and so on, the ability to commence and to weave that together is really meeting with a lot of interest and some of these are our existing customers, but customers that in the past have bought the products as needed from us. ","But now they are saying that we can play a much more significant part in their overall strategy. And I had a chance to talk with some of these customers over the last year in Latin America and in Europe and we are excited and even more excited after the first quarter\u2019s results, because these companies are voting with their wallets. ","And again, it\u2019s a solutions-based approach. It\u2019s the measurement devices, it\u2019s the artificial lifts, it\u2019s the software and then it\u2019s the delivery capability to bring this all together to reduce their cost to produce a barrel of oil. ","Andrew Kaplowitz ","And Blake, I just wanted I just wanted to follow-up on your comment on Latin America. A, is the incremental weakness or the moderation that that you saw really focused on mining and\/or just tough comparisons, there has been a little bit of unrest down there. You just mentioned oil and gas pretty strong. So, just what have seen down there?","Blake Moret","Yes, so, mechanically, we still have some tough comps against that big Codelco project in mining that we've talked about over the last year or so. And that project is going very well by the way. In general, in Latin America, we saw modest growth in Mexico and Brazil, but it was offset by weakness in Argentina and Chile and of course a good component of that would be mining-related. ","Mexico was up low-single-digits and Brazil was also up low-single-digits. So, I think you are right that some of it is comps. We expect mining to be about flat for the year in Latin America.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Thanks, Blake. ","Blake Moret","Yes. ","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Andy.

(Operator Instructions)","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks, Frieda. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda includes the opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company\u2019s performance in the second quarter and the first half, plus the outlook for the full year. And then Ted will provide more details on all of that. And then, of course, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com.

Thanks for joining us on the call today. I\u2019m sure you are all happy to be in the homestretch of earnings season. I\u2019ll start with some highlights. So please turn to page four in this slide deck.","We had another strong sales quarter with 7% organic growth and growth in all regions for the first time in over a year. Let me provide some more color on organic growth by region. The US grew 8% in the quarter, oil and gas continues to be the strongest performing vertical. In addition, we are now starting to see increased activity in chemicals. Auto remains relatively flat at high levels and the consumer goods industries are showing healthy growth.","OEM sales were also strong in the quarter. Canada sales were up slightly, but [technical difficulty]","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","We are hearing some feedback or delay. So, I don't know, Frieda, can you do something to make that go away?","Operator","Okay, is it okay now?","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","I don't know, Keith, go ahead.","Keith Nosbusch","We will start up again. Canada sales were up slightly but there is continued weakness in resource-based industries. EMEA had another good quarter with 4% growth led by emerging markets. Our OEM business remains solid across the region. China's sales increase of 14% was the strongest driver of Asia-Pacific, 10% growth. Latin America had a better quarter and better growth this quarter at 9%. Double-digit growth in Mexico and Brazil offset the sales decline in the rest of the region.","Emerging markets in total grew 11% in the quarter. I've got a couple of other comments on the topline, process sales grew 3% in the quarter, but quarter\u2019s growth was stronger. For the first half, process sales grew 5% and we expect higher than 5% growth in the second half of the fiscal year.","Logix grew 7% in the quarter with the highest growth in Asia-Pacific. In China, we're seeing good OEM adoption of our compact Logix controllers.","Moving onto earnings, you often heard me talk about the quarterly variability of our earnings performance and the first two quarters this year clearly demonstrate that. It's more meaningful and more indicative of underlying trends to talk about our performance in the first half and we had a very good first half performance.","On 7% organic sales growth we delivered over one point of segment operating margin improvement. Adjusted EPS grew 10% in spite of a significant headwind from a higher tax rate and cash flow was also very good in the first half with 92% free cash flow conversion on adjusted income.","At the halfway point in the year, we are where we expected to be and are well-positioned as we entered the second half. Based on that, along with our expectations for continued stable market conditions, we are reaffirming sales and adjusted EPS guidance with a few tweaks.","Compared to our previous guidance, organic growth will be a bit higher, offset by lower sales due to currency and acquisitions. And we're maintaining the adjusted EPS guidance range of $6 to $6.35 in spite of a higher tax rate. Ted will provide more color on the full-year and second half of the year in his remarks.","I would like to take a moment to mention something that I\u2019m very proud of. We recently received the Ethisphere award for the sixth time, naming us \u201cOne of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies.\u201d This recognition reflects our commitment to integrity, responsibility and accountability, all of which drive value for employees, partners, customers and shareholders.","Before I wrap up, I just want to remind you of the Integrated Control and Information opportunity that we talked about at our investor conference last November. Integrated Control and Information, or ICI, is the next wave of innovation in the evolution of the integrated architecture, intelligent motor control and Logix\u2019 multi-disciplined controls.","It will provide the next generation of manufacturing and industrial productivity, thus, delivering business value to our customers across the entire automation investment lifecycle. ICI solutions enable the connected enterprise and makes manufacturing processes smart, productive and secure. We have the innovative technology, the smart people and the partners needed to deliver ICI and expand the value we provide to our customers and shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted?","Ted D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start with chart number five \u2013 second quarter results summary. So another good quarter operationally with continued strong top line growth and pretty good underlying earnings conversion. There are a couple of unusual items impacting the year-over-year earnings comparison. I\u2019ll highlight those, as we move through the charts.","Revenue in the quarter was $1,601 million, up 5% compared to the second quarter of last year. Organic growth was 7% and currency fluctuations reduced sales by approximately 2 points. Q2 last year is our easiest comparison quarter but even given that still very good organic growth performance, and as Keith mentioned, pretty broad-based geographically","Segment operating earnings in the quarter and the current period were $302 million, up 6% compared to Q2 last year. I\u2019ll provide some additional color on operating earnings with our next chart. General corporate-net was $18.9 million in Q2 compared to $18.1 million in Q2 last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.9% that compares to an adjusted effective tax rate in the same period last year of 23.6%.","In Q2, last year we benefited from a catch-up adjustment related to the extension of the US R&D tax credit. The benefit last year coupled with the absence of an R&D credit this year, increased the tax rate in Q2 by approximately 4 points accounting for pretty much of all the year over year increase. This is one of the unusual items I referred to.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.35 that compares to $1.33 in the same quarter last year, so up only about 2%. The higher tax rate reduced adjusted earnings per share by $0.08. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 140.2 million. We repurchased approximately 900,000 shares in the second quarter at a cost of about $111 million. At the end of Q2 there was 314 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization.","Through the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019ve repurchased 1.9 million shares for approximately $221 million, so on pace to hit the $440 million full-year repurchase expectation that we talked about on the previous earnings calls this year.","Moving to chart six, this is the graphical version of total company results for the second quarter. On the left side the chart you can see the 5% year-over-year sales growth; as I mentioned, that was 7% organic growth. Sales increased 1% sequentially.","On the right side of the chart you'll note the year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings, total segment operating margin in Q2 was 18.9%, up 20 basis points from the second quarter of last year. Last quarter, we said we intended to increase spending, spending was up about 4% sequentially and about 6% year-over-year, so pretty much in line with our organic growth.","Incremental earnings conversion was 22%, lower than would be expected with 7% organic growth. That brings me to the second unusual item. Conversion margin in Q2 was impacted by a significant year-over-year increase in variable compensation expense.","Due to last year benefited from a year-to-date adjustment that reduced variable compensation expense that was related to a change to our full-year guidance at this time last year. The lower than normal variable compensation last year is causing about an $8 million negative comparison to the current quarter. If you adjust for that, conversion margin would be about 32%, within our target range and pretty good given a more aggressive spending increase in Q2. While not on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 30.6% at the end of the second quarter.","If you\u2019ll turn to chart number seven, it summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Again, looking at the left side of this chart, sales reached $687 million, up 7% year-over-year as reported and up 9% organically. Sales were down in the segment 1% sequentially.","Keith mentioned that Logix growth was 7%, a little below the segment average. Q2 was a very strong quarter for growth in our Motion Control business, and that\u2019s consistent with continued success with OEM customers.","Operating margin for the quarter was 27.7%. That\u2019s up 1.1 points compared to Q2 last year. The 9% organic growth provided considerable volume leverage, which more than offset the effect of increased spending, a little unfavorable mix and the increased variable compensation expense.","The next page, chart eight, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Compared to Q2 last year, sales were up 3% as reported and up 5% organically. Organic growth in both the Product business the Solutions & Service businesses was about 5%.","Sales for the segment increased 2% sequentially, with the Product businesses and Solutions & Service businesses both up sequentially. Book-to-bill for the Solutions & Services businesses was 1.1 in Q2.","On the right side of the chart, you\u2019ll note that operating earnings were slightly lower than Q2 last year and operating margin declined by 0.8 year-over-year. The benefit of higher sales was more than offset by increased spending, increased variable compensation expense and larger than normal negative currency effects in the quarter.","The next chart is a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I think Keith covered this one well in his comments, so I will turn to chart number 10 which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $188 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is about 92%, that's a very good result for the first half of the year and we continue to expect conversion of about 100% for the full year.","Turning to the next chart, this provides an EPS walk from the first half of last year for the first half of this year. It was a very good first half. Keith mentioned the quarterly variability of our results, that variability is a consequence of many factors including, for example, the two unusual items I talked about that impacted results this quarter. Because of the quarterly variability, the first half maybe a better representation of our underlying performance than either quarter taken alone.","Looking at the bridge, EPS was up 10% increasing from $2.56 to $2.82. That's on organic sales growth for the first half of 7%. The 10% increase in EPS is despite a pretty significant headwind from tax rate which you can see here is worth about $0.11. A small increase in general corporate-net expense was offset by lower share count. And segment earnings were up 12% with incremental margin of about 38%. And that takes us to the final slide, chart 12, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal year 2014.","As Keith mentioned, we continue to expect sales to be about 6.6 billion. However, we now expect organic growth for the full year to be about a half-point higher across the range. 3.5% to 6.5% organic growth compared to the previous guidance of 3% to 6%. That change will offset about a half-a-point of negative impact related to our updated estimates of the full-year currency effects and a little lower sales from acquisitions.","We continue to expect segment margin for the full year to be about 20%. We are reaffirming guidance for adjusted EPS in the range of $6 to $6.35. We now expect a tax rate for the full-year of approximately 27%, that's at the high-end of our previous guidance of 26% to 27%.","We still expect to spend about $440 million on share repurchases this year. And finally, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be about $85 million for the full year. I know you all are aware that we don't provide quarterly guidance, but perhaps the following notes on the second half will be helpful as you start to put together your models.","We expect healthy sequential growth in the second half, but solutions and services growth will be heavily weighted to Q4. That's a typical pattern for our solutions and services businesses. And the year-over-year comparisons, for the second half, growth rates will moderate compared with the first half, because the comparisons get more difficult. That's particularly true in the solutions and services businesses and, especially, in Q3.","As I\u2019ve said, we expect operating margin to be about 20% for the full year. Consistent with my comments on the pattern of second half sales growth, we would expect margin performance to also be weighted to Q4.","Finally, we expect a lower tax rate in the second half due to the expected recognition of discrete tax benefits. It\u2019s difficult to know for sure how that will fall out by quarter, but we expect the discrete tax benefits will be primarily in Q4.","And, with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Ted, thanks. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say we do have quite a few callers in the question queue today, and we do want to get to as many of you as possible. So if you could limit yourself to a question and a follow-up and then get back in the queue, if you\u2019ve got another topic that you want to talk about, so we\u2019d appreciate your cooperation.","And, Frieda, let\u2019s take our first caller","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Please stand by for your first question. So your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Good morning, everybody.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Scott.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Hey, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays","I wanted to get a sense \u2013 I mean; it sounds like your order book is good. If you look at your full year guidance, it implies the mid-point would be 5% core for the full year and you did 7 in the first half. So that would mean more like 3 in the second half.","I mean, what leads you to that conservatism? Is there something that you\u2019re seeing that \u2013 I know your comps are tougher. I get it. But it shouldn\u2019t be to that extent, I wouldn\u2019t think, but maybe you can dig into that a little deeper?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, I think the way you characterize it is exactly right, the percentages and the differences to the 5% number. We don't believe its conservative. The comps get much more difficult in the second half and certainly while the year-over-year will be lower, we still are going to see a significant sequential growth in both the third and fourth quarters. So we think its solid operating performance and nothing really happening in the markets themselves at this point in time.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. So, okay, I guess we will see where that comes out to and then just to clarify in 2Q some of the one-time expenses you had the true up on variable comp and such like that, is there things you identify in the back half the year that will mute some of your operating leverage that we should think about?","Keith Nosbusch","So I think in terms of sequential comparisons, improve margin in the back half of year is going to come primarily from volume leverage.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. But I guess my question is, are you expecting a more normalized operating leverage, volume leverage, in the back half versus 2Q or you know, clearly it was muted due to the higher cost.","Keith Nosbusch","Certainly compared to Q2 but if you look at the first half, our conversion margin was 38%. I mean that's pretty close to what we would expect in second half.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. That's good color. Okay, I will pass it on. Thank you, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities. Please proceed.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Shannon. How are you?","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So just to clarify a little bit, just on this 2Q incrementals in the first place. So, I mean I get the point around some of these spending increase and the comp, but the A&S incrementals were really strong and it was mainly focused in CP&S, so was the comp issue more weighted to CP&S and you also mentioned an unusually large FX impact there, could you maybe just size the impact specifically between the segments?","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah. So, on the $8 million year-over-year increase in the variable comp expense, which I want to remind you is really consequence of lower expense last year. About 60% of that is CP&S and the remainder A&S. So, because CP&S is our heavier more people intensive business, it bears a larger share of that.","CP&S also had an unusually large earnings impact on the currency translation impact in the quarter and that's a consequence primarily of our exposure in CP&S, both more to emerging markets, so countries like Brazil, Argentina, South Africa where we\u2019re seeing some larger currency swings and also higher CPS exposure in Canada where we\u2019re seeing continued weakening of the Canadian dollar.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","And how big was that \u2013 that approximately the FX impact?","Keith Nosbusch","The currency year-over-year was ballpark about half-a-point.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then, just on the chemical market, you mentioned you're starting to see some activity there. Can you just mention maybe where you're seeing that occur and also how Rockwell is playing into those projects?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes. Well, we're seeing that as the down stream effects of the production expansions that have been going on, particularly in North America at this point. And we\u2019re seeing that as it flows into the chemical plants.","You\u2019ve heard about the expansion of petrochemical. But now we\u2019re also seeing some of that \u2013 and this activity is really at the front-end coating and engineering studies that take place. But it\u2019s also in the specialty and fine chemical areas as well.","And we think those are very good opportunities for Rockwell given that it\u2019s much more batch-oriented and, certainly, something that the integrated architecture and our safety capabilities have a great footprint to be able to be successful in.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Shannon.","Operator","Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. What was the dollar amount of the spending this quarter \u2013 the heightened spending this quarter versus last quarter or year-over-year? How does that split between A&S and the CP&S?","Ted D. Crandall","So year-over-year spending increase was about $25 million. Sequentially, it was about $20 million. About half of the sequential increase was our normal merit increase that occurs January 1, and it\u2019s split roughly 50\/50 between the segments.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And do you expect that cadence of spending, Ted, to continue for each of the next two quarters?","Ted D. Crandall","No, I think the sequential ramps will be somewhat less then the next couple of quarters and I think what I would expect to see is about a 5% increase in spending year-over-year in the second half.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","All right. What are you actually spending on and I'm assuming this is mostly people but could you flush out a little bit in terms of whether some of these investments and what kind of a payback do you expect on some of the spending?","Keith Nosbusch","The areas are really in two primary categories. The first one would be development engineering and that would be around a number of the things that we discussed at the investor meeting particularly the integrated control and information opportunities that we've identified as our ability to expand our certain market. The second would be in customer facing resources sales resources. We are adding those in different regions and countries of the world where we see the best growth opportunities.","And as far as the payback on these investments, as you know these investments take time to be able to generate the new products so this is not something that we will see in the remainder of this calendar year. The sales resources will start helping, although it starts helping next fiscal year, although depending on where they are, sometimes the ramp-up and whether they are newer experienced employees, can be from 12 to 24 months before they become fully productive. And our product \u2013 our project schedules tend to be 12 to 30 months, depending on the scope and what exactly that project is and then we would have a ramp-up of sales after that period of time.","So it's really investments for the future and that's why I did mention the fact that we believe we do have these growth opportunities and we've been talking about adding the investment for a number of quarters here. And certainly in the second quarter we were able to bring a lot of people on board and certainly we look forward to the benefits of that down the road.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Yeah. No, I understand. Are you doing this in Asia or Europe or North America, or where's the emphasis?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, the development resources would be in our development centers and the majority of those would be in the US but we also would be adding development people in the Czech Republic and Poland, and then Singapore and China would be the two major ones in Asia.","When you look at the salespeople, we have been adding salespeople in some of the emerging Europe markets. We've been adding in Latin America and to some degree in the US given some of the strength that we've seen in this country and we believe the longer-term potential.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, okay. And then, just as a technical question, Ted, what if the R&D credit later this year is renewed? How does that work? Are you guys going to be able \u2013 are you going to go back and retroactively adjust your tax rates? Like you give us tax hit now, and people sort of assume it\u2019s just part of ops.","And then is there some sort of big fourth quarter number because the risk is Wall Street is just going to think that\u2019s a one-time adjustment? Like how does this work in the past and maybe you could just talk us through the mechanics of that?","Ted D. Crandall","Yeah. So if the R&D tax credit were renewed before the end of our fiscal year \u2013 and, remember, we\u2019re on a September fiscal year, not December. If it were renewed before the end of the fiscal year, then we would do a \u2013 and assuming it was renewed with retroactive application, we would do a catch-up adjustment for the full year. So that would be probably about 0.6, 0.7 point of lower tax rate for the year, if that happens.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Got it. Thanks very much.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hello, everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So I understand the cadence on the CP&S organic growth for the remaining part of the year, as comps get tougher. But I was a little surprised by the growth this quarter of roughly 5% because you had easier comps, and then the book-to-bill on the Solutions side seemed to be pretty good both last quarter and this quarter. So just, perhaps, you can provide a little bit of color on the growth in that business specifically this quarter.","Keith Nosbusch","Well, I think, the book-to-bill is not really a good current quarter substitute for the CP&S Solutions business. It tends to be six months to a longer period before those projects really will enter into a shippable state. And so we do have this lag between the orders and the project completion. The second part of it is project business is lumpy. And depending upon where you are in the cycle of the project where the customer is and if they are doing some acceptance testing or if there has to be a delay because their project is delayed, the project business just is one that is very difficult to predict with certainty as to which ones will make it in a quarter and which ones will either fall out into the next quarter or a longer period of time. So it\u2019s just a challenge from a forecasting standpoint, but book-to-bill is not the only indicator particularly you have to look at the aging of that book-to-bill as to when it is shippable in the future.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that's helpful, Keith. And I just had one follow-up question on the \u2013 I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. So earlier you talk about incremental margins for the second half of the year. I think you said 38% which was comparable to first half. If I'm doing the math correctly, to get to the midpoint of your guidance, it looks like the implied incrementals are closer to 25%. And so are -- you effectively feel confident in the higher end of year guidance for the full-year by expecting 38 for the second half of the year?","Ted D. Crandall","Now Joe, I think you are doing the math incorrectly, but why don't you get with Rondi after the call. I think what you're going to see is the incrementals in the second half are in the high 30s.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Fair enough.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","So we do it on segment operating margins, so I don't know if that's the difference between the way you do it, but...","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Yeah. No, I was doing it on the segment level as well. We can catch up after the call though.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Just a very helpful color on the sequencing in the second half, I guess the seasonality from 2Q to 3Q has been a bit all over the map. I think the 1.1 book-to-bill and to your comments, is kind of similar to 1.1 or 1.15 you\u2019ve done in the last couple of years, so nothing really stand out there.","But I guess last year you were up 5% sequentially, second quarter to third quarter, is that kind of the right range to think about? As always I\u2019m asking, I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but you\u2019re trying to kind of baseline our models here, because there are \u2013 it's seems like there are some moving parts with the lumpiness.","Keith Nosbusch","I think \u2013 well, without providing quarterly guidance I think I would say the 5% sequential increase last year was unusually large.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Okay. So I guess the then year-over-year comp will be similar third quarter, fourth quarter, I guess, is that the right way to look at it? Or a little bit weaker in the third?","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, I suspect a little weaker in the third.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then you mentioned the margins, you guys did 20 bps of segment margin improvement this quarter. Is that the right kind of framework for the third quarter?","Keith Nosbusch","Steve, I don\u2019t want to get that detailed in the quarterly numbers.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then one last question on the ForEx. Companies like 3M which are seeing similar kind of foreign exchange impact or seeing a lot of price go through in kind of a related way. So the ForEx change was pretty dramatic in Latin America, and your organic growth was very strong. Was there an unusual kind of pricing element in the 9% organic there or is it not kind of the same dynamics for you guys?","Ted D. Crandall","No. I would say there is no unusual pricing item in the organic.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. All right. Thanks for the detail. I appreciate it.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thanks for your question. The next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Good morning.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Can you maybe comment on the incremental growth versus your prior expectations? I mean, it clearly sounds likes you\u2019re seeing acceleration and some momentum here. But where specifically and which segments and vertical and geographies, did you actually see the extra kind of -- are you comfortable with the extra 0.5% or is it just too widespread?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, it would be pretty widespread. But, certainly, we\u2019ve seen strong organic growth in A&S. That\u2019s been the better performing segment with respect to the Product sales that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date.","And then, certainly, I would say, the US has continued to perform probably a little bit stronger, and we don\u2019t see any reason for that to change. And it\u2019s really those two that told us we could offset the currency. And acquisition was a little stronger organic growth for the year. And that's basically how we came at what we call the tweak of the make up of the sales number which stayed the same.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And on the process growth side, you mentioned up 5%, and I think going higher and it was, what, 8% last quarter and this has clearly been a two-pronged story in terms of both end markets and penetration. How are you viewing that opportunity, Keith, particularly you talked about the downstream opportunities, etcetera, but is that kind of -- where is the biggest opportunity there and you expected to stay in that range or sort of consistently go higher?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we do expect the second half process to be higher than the first half and the first half as you've said was 5%. So we are expecting it to go up and we see the best opportunity there continue to be in oil and gas. We will get a little bit of help with vMonitor acquisition that we talked about which is really focused at least at this point of its growth into the oil and gas industry. So it\u2019s a nice play into that space. But we are also at least in North America we are beginning to see some investment in the legacy pulp and paper applications.","And so it\u2019s a very aged old installed base and we see that starting to have a little bit more of a pickup and we have a pretty good footprint there in our motor control and now with the process capabilities we can do the wet end of the paper plans as well. So \u2013 but really the strongest play is oil and gas and we got a couple of other opportunities that we believe will get us to that higher growth in the second half.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Keith, can you talk some more about China? It's interesting how your growth has been so strong this half with the Pia mine, other indicators in China being weaker, whereas last year you had really \u2013 you have had declines in a \u2013 what seemed to be a better macro. Can you talk about squaring that circle and what's going on in China for you?","Keith Nosbusch","Sure. Well, the first one, you've kind of touched upon and that is, we had a very weak first half last year and then obviously a much stronger second half, but which is why we're talking about the tough comparables, and China will be one of those tough comparables.","But really, we're seeing continued growth for us into the consumer related industries. So auto continues, Food & Beverage, the \u2013 as they continue to build out and grow the middle class, they\u2019re taking \u2013 and the concerns they have over quality and safety of their food supplies. These are all areas that are very important to us.","Oil and gas continues to be a good growth for us in China, and the OEM performance was probably the leader there. The OEM was very strong this quarter. And that\u2019s just some of the work that our team did there last year, as we \u2013 as quite candidly as we struggled in the first half. We\u2019ve really focused on a couple of areas where we thought the best opportunities were.","And, particularly, as their infrastructure spending comes down and there is no spending in the metals, minimal spending in the cement industry now compared to historical, we had shepherd our resources into the areas where we could see the growth. And we added capabilities and put resources into OEMs and into the consumer products industries. And I think we\u2019re seeing the benefits of some of that activity now.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Okay. Thank you. And then can you do a walk-around of what you\u2019re seeing in automotives around the globe as far as their investment spending?","Keith Nosbusch","Sure. The spending in Europe continues to be very weak, and we don\u2019t see that changing dramatically, as time goes on here. The US spending continues to be relatively high. But we haven\u2019t seen it growing, but it\u2019s at a higher level. And we believe that the projects will continue, as time goes on. So that's been a very positive part of our US business, but we don't see the US spending increasing. Latin America, the strength has been Mexico and Brazil and there has been -- as you know a significant investment from the foreign car manufacturers into Mexico and we continue to see investment going on there.","If we go to Asia, we don't do much in Japan, but certainly China is where all the action is in automotives. And there we see mainly the spending in the passenger car side and heavy with the joint ventures. And that's where we've been able to make most of the inroads. We do participate in the domestic market, the domestic car manufacturers, but they are not investing at the same levels and rates as the joint ventures are. So it\u2019s a little more weighted to the JV.","So really we see the automotive industry as one that continues to provide opportunities for Rockwell. In particular, it\u2019s a very automation intensive industry and automation intensive for a lot of the A&S product portfolio. And then I only will finally comment that we also as we have mentioned activities that we work with FANUC on with powertrain. We see the powertrain as a longer-term growth opportunity in a space that we did not participate fully in all the applications and that will help us in the future.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research","Great. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","You're welcome. Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Please proceed.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, we can, Josh. Go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Thanks. So maybe just a little more color on the cadence of business through the quarter, any impacts from weather, it seems like you guys aren\u2019t really calling that out as much. And then, any dispersion between larger project and more small \u2013 small ticket business, maybe outside of the bigger stuff in service and solutions, but maybe more in kind of the core automation?","Keith Nosbusch","Sure. The \u2013 with respect to the quarter itself, it was a pretty typical quarter. March is always the strongest month for us and this March was. And I would say that nothing inconsistent in how the quarter flowed. If we talk about the project activity, we're not seeing any, I'll say, meaningful change in project delays or anything like that. So it seems like that continues to be at the pace that we have seen earlier.","And then, secondly, your comment about the size of the projects, that would depend on where we are. I would say that the majority of the projects in North America are the smaller projects. We have not seen large ones at this point in time. So that means most of it is modernization as opposed to, I\u2019ll say, Greenfield capacity at this point. And my comments about pulp and paper fit right into that type of a scenario.","If we go outside, in particular, emerging markets is where we see more of the Greenfield. And certainly there is the major project tend to be less resource-driven in China at the moment or, I should say, less metals in heavy industry \u2013 less metals, less cement and, certainly, tend to be more in the consumer space at this point in time.","From a weather standpoint, we had a couple of days where our service engineers couldn\u2019t get to customers. But given all the other moving parts we had this quarter that was certainly not one to point out. It cost us a little bit but, certainly, not to the extent that the other two or three that Ted mentioned earlier in his comments.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the comment that you're not seeing a lot of Greenfield work in North America. Do get the sense that your customers are sitting back on their heels right now and watching? Or is that something that is maybe more of a next year dynamic and for the time being there's really not a lot of, I will call, a pent-up demand for Greenfield spending?","Keith Nosbusch","In the US, I don't think we've seen a lot of Greenfield spending other than when the automotives came back from their downturns and I would say the automotives came back meaning that, when they do new lines and new models you can think of it as Greenfield because we basically re-do it. I think where we are starting to see some of the indications and why I mentioned chemicals is, I think we are starting to see the generation of new chemical plans and that's a broad spectrum, but I think it\u2019s really the downstream from the energy play that's been going on whether it be oil or gas. We are now seeing -- we will see more Greenfield or I should say just large projects as they move that down the process and stream.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","You're welcome, Josh.","Operator","Thank you for your questions. And next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","We've covered a lot of ground, so just a couple of quick follow-ups, so Ted you gave some color on 3Q already, more color than someone who doesn\u2019t give quarterly guidance, yet, FX relative to what we saw in 3Q, does it look similar in 3Q, down about two points?","Ted D. Crandall","I think right now I would expect FX earnings impact to be lower in Q3 than Q2.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's helpful. And then the 50 bps impact to CPF margins from FX. Is that because the \u2013 kind of the Brazil etcetera, carry higher margins or is there another reason, is there some sort of revenue cost this much closing that pinch?","Ted D. Crandall","No. I mean I don\u2019t think it's higher margins in those countries, it's just \u2013 it's a consequence of the impact on the transactions in those countries in the currency depreciation as well as summary measurement losses on the balance sheet.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then just wanted to dig into, I think you mentioned some discrete tax items which probably hit in 4Q, Ted. Number one, were those in your guidance originally and since we're now looking at $0.27 tax rate for the year that implies 3Q is going to be higher than $0.27?","Ted D. Crandall","The discrete items were largely in our original tax guidance at the beginning of the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Ted D. Crandall","And it's hard to call exactly how those will fall out in the balance of the year, but I think they will be more weighted to Q2 which would suggest \u2013 I'm sorry, Q4. So if you think about an average in the second half of about 26%, I think we're going to be higher than that in Q3.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks Ted.","Ted D. Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick one for me. On the book-to-bill, the 1.1 \u2013 last quarter, it was 1.1 as well. And my impression was that you\u2019d expect some kind of tick-up here in Q1 versus Q1.","So could you just give us some color on how that relates to expectations? And then if it was below expectation for the quarter, was there just \u2013 I know, Keith, you just said there wasn\u2019t really any project push-outs, but it is a lumpy business. But just what are you seeing that would have pushed that number to be flat sequentially?","Ted D. Crandall","So, Rich, this is Ted. So I\u2019d say the 1.1 in Q1 was lower than what we would normally expect to see in Q1. 1.1 in Q2 is pretty much normal expectation for Q2, so no big surprise here. It came in pretty much the way we expected it to come in.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. So no real change versus what you were thinking going into the quarter?","Ted D. Crandall","Correct.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Rich.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. I think we\u2019ve got time for one last caller.","Operator","Okay. The next question comes from line of Richard Eastman from Robert W Baird. Go ahead, please.","Richard Eastman - Robert W Baird","Yeah. Keith, could you just talk to \u2013 as we look to the end of the fiscal year and you\u2019ve got your core \u2013 Rockwell has got their core revenue growth guidance on the board.","When you look at how the two segments will play out relative to that guidance, it appears as though the Architecture & Software business will be towards the high end from a growth perspective. Maybe, core growth will be 6, 6.5% versus the CP&S business will be towards the lower end.","And I\u2019m \u2013 I am just curious, from your perspective, is there a message in those growth rates relative to where we are in the cycle, or is spent, again, are getting this ICI theme? I mean, how do you view the growth rates in those two pieces of business relative to the cycle, global business cycle?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, for the full-year A&S would be at the higher end to your point, probably around 7% and CP&S would be lower, probably around 4 to get you to that average that you talked about. We don't believe that that indicates anything from the cycle. I think what we are seeing is that the industries where we see the best growth is the US and certainly the US is a heavier A&S content then CP&S because of two reasons.","One, the types of the industries that we support and then secondly, there is a very mature system integrated market here and many of our product go through the system integrators as opposed to through our solutions business in the US, particularly in the consumer products industry. And so we get solidly heavier product content in that. When we go outside the US, it\u2019s more our people have to supply the project work and so it\u2019s different in that regard, so.","Richard Eastman - Robert W Baird","Okay, I understand. And then just one last question, on the OEMs side of the business and the OEM sales, has there been any shift in end markets or applications that's noticeable?","I tend to think of the OEM business as being kind of packaging, food and bev oriented. There's been so much talk and investment into the robotics industry, the collaborative side, the smaller payload robots. Is there any shift in that business towards a compact logic or anything that suggests that that could be a growth driver going forward?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we certainly believe the OEMs would be a growth driver. And as I mentioned, our Motion business had a strong quarter and we had good OEM growth in China, in the US and parts of Europe. So \u2013 and part of that is because of compact Logix to your point. It allows us to have a better price point and sell the Architecture across to customer's complete portfolio of machines.","But you have to think a little broader of the OEM space, if you will. Certainly, the most recognizable one is packaging and quite frankly, when you go to pack expo, that's what it is all about. It's around packaging machines and those are big displays whether it\u2019d be in Chicago or Las Vegas or Europe.","But the other segments are very important. Tire is a very important segment. We do very well in that globally. We have process skewed OEMs that equipment comes into a processing plant. And many times, our controllers are what are on that equipment, including drives and instrumentation with our partner.","So there are multiple segments. We have the heavy industries\u2019 activities, the energy, some of the compressor and turbine OEM. So it\u2019s much broader than just packaging. Material handling is a very important segment. And then to your point, robotics, and a lot of times we work on that with a lot of the end of the line packaging equipment as well as robotics into automotive.","So we have like six segments in the OEM space that we focus on, and I would say we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic shift in those segments. Packaging has been very strong for the last couple of years. Tire has been very strong.","And we\u2019ve been improving our ability to compete particularly in the process skid with our Process initiative. And then also some of our drive technology has opened up more opportunities in converting print and web, in particular, converting into home and personal care side is a very important segment for us as well.","Richard Eastman - Robert W Baird","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Rick.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. With that, we\u2019re going to wrap up today\u2019s call. So we just want to thank all of you for joining us. And, of course, I\u2019d be available to answer any more questions after the call. Thanks.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel please go ahead.","Steve Etzel","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Moret","Thanks Steve. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. Our results for the quarter reflect profitable growth in all regions led by strong process industry performance. We saw accelerating growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services reflecting adoption of the Connected Enterprise.","Our growth was tempered by weaker than expected automotive sales which were down about 20% year-over-year. This impacted our product sales in the quarter, particularly in North America.","In this region, we saw a strong product growth in January. February was weak with orders picking up in late March. Globally, organic sales were up 3.6%. From a vertical perspective, growth was once again led by Heavy Industries which grew high-single-digits and Consumer which grew mid-single-digits.","Heavy Industries' growth was led by oil and gas, pulp and paper, and mining. Oil and gas grew double-digits. In Consumer, Life Sciences was very strong. I already mentioned Automotive, but within Transportation, Tire grew nicely up double-digits. Our KPI for process sales grew 10% organically. The weakness in automotive drove the 2% decline in logics.","Commenting on regional performance in the quarter. North America, which for us is the combination of the U.S. and Canada, grew 2% organically. While Automotive weakness significantly impacted the overall growth rate for this region, growth was broad-based across a wide range of industries.","In pulp and paper, we won a significant process and power control order this quarter with Green Bay Packaging. EMEA was up over 5% in the quarter led by Consumer and Tire. Asia grew about 4% led by Heavy Industries and Automotive. China grew 6.5%. Latin America sales were up 13% led by Heavy Industries.","I'll make a few additional comments about our Q2 results. Adjusted EPS was up 8% and segment operating margin expanded 40 basis points year-over-year. Book-to-bill performance for our Solutions and Services businesses was 1.09 in Q2. Backlog remains high. Patrick will elaborate on our second quarter financial performance in his remarks.","Let's move on now to guidance for full year fiscal 2019. Forecast continue to call for industrial production growth. We continue to see broad-based growth with strong financial performance. However, given the weakness in Automotive, we are reducing the high end of our guidance range for organic sales growth and adjusted EPS.","We expect our fiscal 2019 organic sales to be up 4.5% year-over-year at mid-oint of guidance. Currency is now expected to reduce growth by two percentage points. Including the revised impact of currency, our fiscal 2019 guidance is sales of about $6.8 billion. Mid-point of the updated adjusted EPS guidance range is now $9 compared to $9.05 in previous guidance. As Patrick will discuss in a few minutes, this guidance does not include the impacts of the Sensia joint venture.","Moving onto slide four. I'll provide an update on two recent strategic investments to increase long-term value for our customers and share owners. Our strategic partnership with PTC is progressing well. We're winning profitable new business across all focus industries and geographies and some of our engagements are expanding to multisite rollouts.","Even in Automotive where overall spending is down, customers are excited about our FactoryTalk InnovationSuite. Recently, Ford decided to expand this new offering to additional locations. Another customer, ECARX, an affiliate of Geely Auto Group, chose the FactoryTalk InnovationSuite to improve production management and quality.","In Consumer, Rockwell Automation is partnering with Stanley Black & Decker to bring the Connected Enterprise to life through their Manufactory 4.0 digital manufacturing division.","As shown on the right side of this slide, in February, we announced that we will be forming the Sensia joint venture with Schlumberger, creating the oil and gas industry's first fully integrated automation solutions provider for the digital oilfield. The announcement has been well received by target customers. Activities to form the joint venture are well underway.","Now, I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q2 results and our 2019 sales and earnings guidance.","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I will start on slide five, key financial information second quarter. Reported sales in the quarter were about flat year-over-year, with 3.6% organic growth mostly offset by currency translation of 3.2%. Organic growth was lower than we expected, driven by weaker automotive sales in North America.","Segment operating margin remained strong at 21.3% and was up 40 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth was partially offset by higher investment spend.","General corporate net expense of $27 million was up $2 million compared to last year. Adjusted EPS of $2.04 was up $0.15 compared to the second quarter of last year, an increase of 8%. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is primarily due to the benefit of higher sales and lower share count, partially offset by higher investment spending and higher net interest expense.","Free cash flow was $105 million in the quarter, about 45% conversion and weaker than normal for us in Q2. There are several elements that contributed to this.","First, our tax payments are overweight to the first half this year and specifically in Q2. We paid about half of what we expect to pay for the full year in Q2, including the first installment on the repatriation tax that is owed as a result of Tax Reform. Overall, tax payments were about $140 million in the quarter, about $65 million higher compared to Q2 last year.","Second, we issued $1 billion of long-term debt in the quarter. In advance of this transaction, we entered into interest rate hedges. We closed out the hedges at the time we issued debt which resulted in us paying about $36 million to settle the hedges. Even though this relates to the debt financing and this amount gets amortized to interest expense over the length of the debt term, this payment gets reported as an operating cash outflow, which reduced free cash flow in the quarter.","Working capital was another factor particularly inventory. We've talked in the past about activities related to our supply chain, including some manufacturing re-foot printing in Europe and the relocation of our U.S. distribution center. We have built safety stock to facilitate these activities and we expect to reduce this inventory by fiscal year-end. I will talk about full year free cash flow when I discuss guidance.","A few additional items to cover not shown on the slide. For adjusted EPS, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 120 million, down 8.5 million or about 6.5% from last year. We repurchased about 1.4 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $236 million. Through March 31st, repurchases amount to $529 million and are slightly ahead of pace to get to a $1 billion full year target. At March 31st, we had $580 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","Slide 6 provides the sales and margin performance overview for the Architecture & Software segment. Year-over-year sales declined 2.2% in this segment. Organic sales were up 1.2% year-over-year. Acquisitions added one-tenth of a point currency translation decreased sales by 3.5%. For the quarter, segment margin contracted 30 basis points year-over-year, yet remains very strong at 28.4%.","Moving on to slide 7, Control Products & Solutions. Reported sales were up 2.5% for the segment, organic sales growth was 5.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 3.2%. Growth in our Solutions and Services businesses in this segment was strong at over 8%. The Product businesses in this segment were up about 2% on an organic basis. Operating margin for the segment was up 140 basis points compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to higher sales largely offset by higher investment spending.","The next slide 8 provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I'll just mentioned that growth was broad-based across geographies. Also, we saw a good growth in emerging markets, which were up high-single digits compared to last year.","This takes us to slide 9 guidance. Before I cover what is on the slide, I will make some comments about Sensia the JV that we and Schlumberger announced in February this year. JV formation activities are underway and regulatory approvals are pending.","As Blake mentioned, the impact on our financial statement is dependent on timing of close, and we have therefore not included the estimated impact of Sensia in our fiscal 2019 guidance. Assuming a close by the end of our fiscal year September 30, we continue to estimate a $0.05 EPS headwind for fiscal 2019. With that, let me move to guidance.","We now project sales of about $6.8 billion for full year fiscal 2019. We reduced the high end of our organic growth range to reflect continued expected weakness in Automotive. Our organic sales growth range is now 3.7% to 5.3% with the midpoint of 4.5%. Currency translation is now expected to be about at two point headwind. We continue to expect segment operating margin of about 22%. Our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 is now about 19% compared to 19.5% in our January guidance.","We're also lowering the upper end of our adjusted EPS guidance range. Our new range is $8.85 to $9.15. Compared to prior guidance, volume and mix headwinds are partially offset by reduced spending, and the benefit from the lower tax rate. We are assuming 119.5 million average diluted shares outstanding for fiscal 2019.","With respect to tariffs, we remain on track to neutralize the incremental costs through supply chain changes and negotiations with vendors, as well as targeted price increases on affected products. We continue to project free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income.","General corporate-net is now projected to be about $95 million to $100 million. As a reminder, general corporate-net now excludes interest income.","Net interest expense for fiscal 2019 is expected to amount to about $90 million, consistent with our January guidance.","In short, we expect another year of strong financial performance. Our updated guidance at the midpoint projects 11% adjusted EPS growth on 4.5% organic sales growth and the year-over-year increase in operating margin of about 0.5 point.","With that, I'll hand it back over to Steve.","Steve Etzel","Thank you. Before we start the Q&A, I just wanted to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And your first question here comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Scott Davis","Hey good morning guys.","A \u2013 Blake Moret","Good morning.","A \u2013 Patrick Goris","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Scott Davis","I can't remember a quarter where process was in that double digit, but everything else was a little bit slower. And help -- I know your business is lumpy, so quarter-to-quarter sometimes isn't the best way to look at things. But help us understand really the CapEx versus OpEx that you're seeing out there and maybe the type of visibility that you see on projects of various sizes.","A \u2013 Blake Moret","So continuing the theme that we've talked about in the past few quarters, Heavy Industries continues to be strong and Heavy Industries are biased towards process application. So we had a really strong quarter in oil and gas. Mining continues strong due in part to high backlog that we entered the year with. And within those, we're seeing a mix of both capital projects as well as ongoing small projects and servicing the installed base.","I mention as well in my prepared remarks, I've talked about Information Solutions and Connected Services growth accelerating and there was a fair part of that that was in process industries. So for instance, we received our largest ever MES order at the European Pharma Company Lonza and that is encouraging because it's new value in these process applications.","Q \u2013 Scott Davis","No that's helpful. And maybe this is a little bit picky again, but in auto, I mean we know auto sales are relatively weak, but is there any visibility on Auto CapEx coming back? I mean I know there is -- seem to be a crap ton of EV launches coming in the next two years and just help us understand the cadence of when that spend may start to really kick in?","A \u2013 Blake Moret","Yes. We're already seeing the very front end of what we do expect to be increased spend for CapEx in EV. It's still a small part of our overall total in Auto, but EV is set to double this year for us. It's just that it's -- we'll see some of that in the balance of this fiscal year and then we do see continued increases into '20. I think within the given CapEx spending for the general auto market, the capacity and the model changes have to contend with spending at the brand owners for investment in EV and autonomous vehicles. So they're new contenders for that CapEx spend regardless of the size of it.","Q \u2013 Scott Davis","Okay. That\u2019s helpful Blake. Good luck. Thank you.","A \u2013 Blake Moret","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Steve Tusa","Hey guys. Good morning.","A \u2013 Blake Moret","Good morning Steve.","Q \u2013 Steve Tusa","What are you seeing over in China? And how do we kind of read or maybe link what's going on with some of the robotics guys and some of the Japanese suppliers in there to kind of what's happening in your business? So I know that there's definitely capacity being added, but a bit of slowing in that end market. I know you guys don't do anything kind of directly for the robot, but like, how do we kind of reconcile what you guys are seeing versus what you're seeing from those customers?","A \u2013 Blake Moret","So we did have a reasonably strong quarter in China with 6.5% growth. That included a growth in automotive. And I think one of the reasons for that is China, the percentage of investment in EV is probably a little bit ahead in some of the other markets. And as we've talked about, we have a really good readiness to serve in the EV portion of the auto market.","So I think that was part of it. We've also heard that some of the stimulus spending in China has helped prompt growth in metro and water projects and those are both good industries for us as well.","Steve Tusa","So how much do you think EV for you guys? How much was Auto in China up? And then how much of -- how much was EV if you can break that up at all? And then also from order timing perspective, would they order all like the robots first and then order your stuff? Or does it all come at the same time?","Blake Moret","So Auto was up mid-single digits in China for us. I don't know the split of EV versus traditional internal combustion projects other than to say it would be a higher weighting towards EV than in other parts of the world.","And then in terms of the spend in the cycle for robotics, a lot of it has to do when our orders are released to the tooling suppliers and then when they decide to enter the orders to us, but I don't know that there's going to be a strict sequence when the robot orders are placed and when orders are placed for our products.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the color.","Blake Moret","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Inch","Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Blake Moret","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, guys. So the down 20% in Auto, is that the new run rate embedded in your guidance like Patrick for the year? And -- or are there things that you think moderate that cadence improve it so to speak towards the back half or into next year?","Blake Moret","Yeah. John I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick will add a little bit. So we mentioned that we were down in the quarter around 20% in Auto and we're expecting the full year to be down about 10%. We do have line of sight for some projects that have already started to make purchases. We expect some of that will show up in the year.","And with that Patrick maybe some additional comment.","Patrick Goris","We don't expect year-over-year growth in any quarter Q3 or Q4 in Automotive, John. Sequentially we expect Q3 and Q4 to pick up just a little bit low single-digit. Flat to slightly up and that refers to some of the larger projects that we know are in flight that Blake was referring to.","John Inch","Okay. That's helpful. Switching actually just to the JV with Schlumberger, Sensia. How are you guys going to gauge success in this business? And I don't think I saw what financial targets you would establish but is there anything you could share with us?","Blake Moret","Yeah. It's a double-digit profitable growth. When you look at the digital oilfield markets, which is already over $5 billion, we believe the market itself is growing double digits. So we, obviously, expect to grow above the market. And so it is a very simply profitable growth in the upstream oil and gas business.","From a financial target point of view, John we talked about one. We expect to achieve our financial criteria through acquisition so 10% free cash flow yield in year\u2019s three to five.","The other thing is for fiscal 2019, assuming a close at the end of this fiscal year, which is not completely in our control given the regulatory approvals, we expect $0.05 EPS headwind. For fiscal 20, we expect it to be above EPS neutral including about $0.10 of fees and intangible amortization","John Inch","And Patrick not to get nitpicky what's the nature of dilution. Is that because you're giving up profit to the JV, but don't you capture that back or is it investment spending?","Patrick Goris","There are setup costs and deal fees and transaction fees associated with that in fiscal 2019. And if we close it by the end of this fiscal year, we would see some of the setup costs but wouldn't see any of the revenue that comes with the JV.","John Inch","Got it. Busy morning. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you.","Blake Moret","Thanks, John.","Patrick Goris","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning.","Patrick Goris","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Just two quick things from me. Just first on investment spending. Patrick, I think you said you're expecting lower investment spending. Are you just bringing that down in concert with the change in the revenue guide? Or is there some other kind of posture you're taking on investment spending here?","Patrick Goris","No Jeff. You're right. During the -- during our second quarter, and as Blake mentioned we saw, weakness starting in February. We decided to push out some of our increased spending for the full year. Last year we talked -- last quarter we talked about $70-or-so million.","We're thinking about $20 million less, increase for the full year. This is going to be focused on lower discretionary spend. We're protecting, our most important investments of course.","And of that $50 million $55 million increase we're talking about now we still expect about two-thirds of that we would have seen in the first half of the year. So we've seen most of the call it ramp up and spend.","Jeff Sprague","And in terms of process Blake, could you just provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing upstream versus downstream? Is there any pause at all in your upstream activity, as you're prepping for Sensia to happen? Just any other color there would be helpful.","Blake Moret","Yeah. We continue to see, oil and gas activity continues strong. We had double-digit growth in the quarter. And as you know, we're a little bit heavier exposed on the upstream and midstream. So we think it's a good time for Sensia.","Besides, oil and gas and process, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about Green Bay Packaging. That was a significant paper machine project with all the ancillary equipment that'll be worth over $10 million to us. So we are seeing CapEx spend in different parts of the process market.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you.","Blake Moret","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Good morning. Maybe just starting off with the North America business, you talked about the sharp slowdown there in organic growth in Q2, but a better or there's some sort of exit rates?","So just wondered what should we expect for, North America growth in the second half, versus what you did in Q2. And were there any specific verticals that have seen that pickup?","Patrick Goris","Yeah. So Julian for the second half of the year, we expect actually somewhat similar growth rates as we've seen in the second quarter for North America. And so in general we expect continued above-average growth in our Solutions and Services business which are most -- more exposed of course with some of the heavy industries that we're talking about, but our product business is we expected about similar growth rates in Q3, Q4 than what we've seen in the second quarter.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. And then my second question, would be around, if you'd experienced much or any inventory adjustments for some of your particularly products obviously, at any particular clusters of OEMs or distribution? Or whether you felt that inventory adjustments have been in line with kind of normal seasonality?","Patrick Goris","Julian there is nothing that we've seen that indicates that inventory moves were of significant impact one way or the other on our quarterly results.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you very much.","Patrick Goris","Thanks, Julian.","Blake Moret","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Q \u2013 Nigel Coe","Yeah. Good morning.","Patrick Goris","Good morning.","Q \u2013 Nigel Coe","I'm having some problems here with the mute button. So a quick question. Your peers Seimens and Schneider have been quite cautious on The Street market commentary in general ABB as well. And obviously you called out automotive down 20%, that's about a two-point drag to your guidance initially.","But I'm wondering, how was the health of your other three markets. And then, in particular I'm thinking about semis and just general manufacturing. How would you describe the health ex-auto industry?","Blake Moret","So when we look at the other, let's say clusters of more discrete industries than Consumer. We continue to see good growth there. There is a mix of discrete and process applications there. But through the year I mentioned just a few minutes ago about the big project in pharma, Life Sciences continues to be a very strong growth vertical for us. And there's growth in other parts of Consumer as well. We also mentioned that Tire was a bright spot in this quarter. Tire is a great fit for our offering, because it has elements of process as well as discrete. And Tire is strong in the worldwide picture as well.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And semi. I think you were talking about that being up mid single-digits. Is that playing out the way you expected?","Patrick Goris","Semi for the quarter Nigel was down about mid single-digit.","Blake Moret","After a couple of years of strong double-digit growth semiconductor has moderated. We continue to participate in projects largely around the environmental control a lot of software-based projects, but we have seen a moderation in semi.","Nigel Coe","Okay. No surprise. I know that there's a lot of people in the queue. So I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.","Blake Moret","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Good morning. Blake, could you just speak to the Information Solutions and Connected Services business? I think you mentioned was plus double-digits. Can you just maybe sift out if any the PTC contribution actually in dollars and pushing that growth rate up. Is there -- can you better define may be how PTC and some of the early wins there have maybe pushed the growth rate up there a bit? Are we seeing that?","Blake Moret","We are seeing that. And while in terms of showing up as revenue, it's still early given the subscription nature of these. It allows us to have richer conversations with customers across really all of our target industries and in multiple geographies. And so PTC's offering, whether it's the ThingWorx or the Kepware or even the Vuforia augmented reality those add to our portfolio. And in addition to the offerings that we internally have been working on the analytics and so on it allows us to bring what is really the industry-leading portfolio to these customers.","And the best proof is what customers are buying. Customers who've had exposure to all of our competitors, our traditional competitors, new competitors are picking us, because our offering and our focus on outcomes is carrying the day. And I would say, it's not just a traditional decision-makers that we're talking to. CIOs are in these discussions. CFOs. In some cases, we're seeing people leading the IoT programs, if these customers actually report to the CFOs and we're happy to have those discussions, because of our focus on business outcomes.","Richard Eastman","And just my follow-up question is just around given the mix of business and where we're seeing strength whether on the Heavy Industries process businesses, which typically have a bit -- a longer tail to them. The business feels later cycle in general, when I look at the end markets, the growth in the end markets. How do you assess that? When you look at your front log, the book-to-bill here at 1.02 is -- it's better than 1, but it seems to be a little bit softer than where it's historically run in the second quarter. And any thoughts about kind of length of cycle or what you're seeing from a front log standpoint relative to where you're showing growth in your -- in Rockwell's business?","Blake Moret","Sure. So first of all book-to-bill in the quarter for Solutions and Services was 1.09 and so we thought that that would help for the second quarter. And we believe that the quarter does point to success and increasing our exposure to additional industries some of which are traditionally looked at as more life cycle. So we talk about strength in oil and gas and in mining. We see even in some of the more traditionally short cycle businesses adding the new value through the Information Solutions and Connected Services. Taken together they really are part of our very deliberate attempt to find more ways to win and to increase recurring revenue because in each of these areas there's a high component of subscription-based software and recurring service revenue.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Thank you much.","Blake Moret","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Deepa Raghavan","Good morning guys.","Blake Moret","Good morning.","Deepa Raghavan","Your commentary -- just to suggest that things were pretty much in line with what you were expecting with perhaps the exception of Automotive. Outside of organic, probably currency was a bigger headwind. But my question is with regards to 2019 organic growth guide up higher end at 5%, what kind of gets you there at this time? I mean Automotive you seems to -- you've obviously slashed your expectations there, but what are the other industries that could get you to that high end of organic growth guide?","Blake Moret","Yes. So, in Heavy Industries, it would be the continued strong growth in Heavy Industries through the year that takes us to that high end and then Automotive meeting the expectations that we talked about earlier.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. So, you're not necessarily assuming Automotive's get -- I mean you're assuming there's some -- it gets better from comps and stuff, but you're not necessarily expecting it to bounce back to positive on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, you're seeing it down 10%, but it's not--","Blake Moret","We think we've taken a realistic approach to Automotive as were factored in the guidance for the year.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Got it. So, you're pretty strong in Europe especially with the OE machine builders. I mean that region is weakening and looks like your outlooks probably contemplate that slow down. But can you right-size us on what your regional expectations are within that full year guide now organic growth? Thank you.","Patrick Goris","So, we think that for EMEA, we think it will be about the company average in terms of organic growth. Yes for the full year. We strengthened in Tire and in Consumer.","Deepa Raghavan","How about the other regions too?","Blake Moret","You mean for the--?","Deepa Raghavan","No, China, Americas, et cetera?","Patrick Goris","Sure. For the full year we now expect North America to be a little bit below the company average at the midpoint, EMEA at above the company average, Latin America we expect to be our strongest region, double-digit growth, Asia we expect to be at above the company average, and same for China, above company average for China for the full year.","Deepa Raghavan","Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Goris","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning. If you could just review your Auto performance in the context of A&S and CP&S and talk about what you saw in terms of your bridging year-over-year for the operating profit decline on a dollar basis? Is there anything -- any kind of color you can give us there just so we get a sense of kind of the mix headwind?","Patrick Goris","Yes, the way I would answer that question Rob is that our Automotive business would be overweight in Architecture & Software versus Control Products & Solutions. So, the largest impact of Automotive would be on Architecture & Software including logics compared to the Control Products & Solutions segment.","Robert McCarthy","All right. Thank you for that. And then in terms of PTC, could you talk about how that relationship is going? And then in particular should we expect any kind of further product enhancements or launches around there for confab in Boston in June the ThingWorx?","Blake Moret","Sure. So, Rob you may have heard last night when PTC announced they talked about good bookings growth in IoT and satisfaction probably more than satisfaction with the relationship and we agree with that. We're seeing good success. We've had -- this really energized our salesforce with 1,500 people in the organization trying on the PTC products and how they add to the overall solution.","And the best proof is that customers in all industries and in all geographies are voting with their wallets that this is a great solution. So, we think it's going well. It speaks well to the future and the additional value that we can provide from financial standpoint. This contributes to our ability to more than double the $300 million of Information Solutions and Connected Services business that we had last year. In 2022, that's profitable growth with a high element of recurrent revenue from subscriptions and services. So, we're very happy with the progress of the relationship.","Rob McCarthy","Thanks for your time. ","Blake Moret","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Vladimir Bystricky","Good morning, guys. This is Vlad Bystricky on for Andy.","Blake Moret","Morning.","Vladimir Bystricky","So shifting back to the regions a bit. EMEA's strength in the quarter is a little surprising just given some of the headlines we've seen out of Europe. So can you talk about what changed versus 1Q, 2019 when EMEA was down to now mid single digit growth and the growth that you're talking about seeing for the remainder of the year?","Blake Moret","I'll make a couple of comments and then Patrick might have some as well. As we mentioned, in EMEA, the growth was led by consumer. And tire was especially strong. As I mentioned before tire is a good industry for us and a lot of the tire builders are in Europe and there was some significant purchases that contributed to those results.","Patrick Goris","Yeah. I would also say the last quarter we said that our backlog looks good and were a little bit higher that we expected some organic growth in the balance of the year which is what we started seeing in the second quarter. So, we expect some modest growth in EMEA for the balance of the year as well.","Vladimir Bystricky","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the free cash flow outlook. I know you mentioned some of the headwinds that impacted F2Q. But can you talk about, one, whether the weakening in auto and -- was any incremental drag on free cash in the year and then just given the unchanged guidance your level of confidence in driving that acceleration in the back half of the year.","Patrick Goris","Yeah. So, we don't believe that auto has a significant impact on free cash flow other than, of course, a drag on sales that we've been seeing. In terms of our confidence, obviously, we have high confidence. We're going to be able to deliver 100% free cash flow for the year. That's why our guidance remains unchanged compared to the one we provided last quarter. And obviously that guidance is second half weighted.","Vladimir Bystricky","Great. Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Patrick Goris","Good morning, John.","John Walsh","Hi. So a lot of ground covered, but I wanted to go back to your comment around acceleration on the Information Solutions and Connected Services. Continues to grow double-digit. That can mean a lot of things. Can you kind of talk about the order of magnitude of the acceleration you're seeing?","And then I guess as a follow-up to that one of the things we picked up over at Hannover is that payback periods are shortening on some of these investments. What's actually driving that acceleration in your mind? Is it quicker paybacks? Is there something else as people prepare for 5G kind of anything you think?","Blake Moret","Sure. Well, we are seeing acceleration and its strong double-digit growth in the quarter which is helped by the PTC relationship complementing our own internally developed offerings. I think the biggest factor towards the growth of our business and really of the whole market is the ability to deliver positive business outcomes. So, you have to start with the ability to quantify what savings you're providing for that customers. Everything else is really just talk. And so by focusing on helping those customers get to market faster being able to increase the OE with operational productivity, the predictive maintenance, we understand those areas and the specific ways that we can help in our target industries. And so payback periods of less than a year should be realistic as company invest in that first pilot, quantifies, the results and then moves on to multisite rollouts.","I would also mention that, our success has been putting the software and the services on top of a wide variety of control systems. In some cases, some part of our logic space systems. Other times, it's on top of the competitors, where we'd come in and added that new value. So it's an exciting area for us to be.","John Walsh","Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up on that. So when you do put your \u2013 when you come in and do the integration side of the work if it's not on top of logics, I mean, how does the mix on that project look for Rockwell? Because I would think \u2013 maybe not \u2013 there's obviously going to be multiple projects and they're all going to look differently, but can you just talk about the mix impact that you see in some of those projects?","Blake Moret","Sure. In general, it's going to be around the Rockwell average. And so the software is very profitable. When there's the delivery that's more labor-intensive that's going to be a little bit below our average. But regardless of whether we're providing the logics and the drives and so on along with the software and the services, just like bucket the Information Solutions and Connected Services has profitability about the Rockwell average and it has a higher degree of recurring revenue than the Rockwell average.","John Walsh","Got you. Appreciate it that. Thank you.","Blake Moret","Thanks, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Graham","Hi. Good morning.","Blake Moret","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Graham","Kind of a question on tariffs, I know that, you commented that you still fully expect to offset them for the year. I think the number coming into the year was something like $90 million. The plan at the time is as I remember was half price half supply chain, I believe. And I was just kind of wondering if you could sort of A, kind of tell us, where pricing sort of landed in the quarter. B, is there any changes to the buckets? And C, back to B, I guess, with the likelihood of moving up to 25% seemingly much dimmer now does that change the $90 million?","Patrick Goris","Yes, Scott. So with respect to pricing our overall price realization in the quarter was about 0.5 which is consistent with what we expect for the full year. With respect to changes in the tariffs, we still project to have a neutral impact on our financials. The cost versus what we realized through price and negotiations with vendors, if the 10% on this three does not go to 25 the full year impact or the annual impact of nine headwinds will be closer to 70, 75. But then again it wouldn't have an impact on our overall financials because we're targeting it to be neutral for our fiscal year.","Scott Graham","So you \u2013","Patrick Goris","I would say in \u2013 in short it is playing out \u2013","Scott Graham","Sorry.","Patrick Goris","Scott?","Scott Graham","Please. Well I was just asking then you would pull back on your supply chain initiatives to balance that off?","Patrick Goris","No. The way you could think about this is if the $10 million does not go to $25 million there won't be a need for us to be implement another price increase associated with tariffs.","Scott Graham","Fine. Okay. Great. Thank you. I want to maybe go back to Auto and beat that horse a little better I guess. So first quarter Auto was down 10 and this quarter you're saying it's down 20. Yet, you're projecting full year minus 10. On a situation, it looks like it actually deteriorated further this quarter. And I know you said, you've outlined the side on some things and also I think you're facing minus 10 comps in the second half. But I'm just kind of hoping you could give us a little bit more on kind of how we get there into the minus 10 in the second half of the year?","Blake Moret","Yes, Scott. So the way you can think about this whereas Q2 was down about 20% year-over-year, it was pretty much flat compared to our first quarter. And so for the balance of the year, we expect Automotive in Q3 and Q4 to be slightly up low-single-digits related to some of the larger projects that we know are in flight. And so, call it, flattish to slightly up for the balance of the year. From a year-over-year point of view, we still expect Auto to be down, just not as much as 20% year-over-year in Q3 and Q4.","Scott Graham","So Auto rest of year, flat to slightly up from the first half, but down year-over-year?","Patrick Goris","Correct.","Scott Graham","Got it. If I could just sort of sneak one last question in here, and it's kind of more to do about what your customers are saying out there. And you've given us great color, and I certainly appreciate that. But I was hoping maybe a little bit more from the customers' standpoint away from the PTC agreement, which I know is working the whole thing. But when you're doing the portion of CapEx of your sales, customers kind of know now where they're going to be by the end of the year. So I was just wondering if you can sort of give us some flakes of what the customers are saying maybe in Heavy Industries. We've talked about Auto maybe in the consumer areas, what the customers specifically are saying, and if possible maybe loop in how orders in those businesses are.","Blake Moret","Right. So, we've mentioned before that in process, we continue to see CapEx being released, and it's reflected in some of the projects that we're talking about. We talked previously in Life Sciences, Pfizer. Today we talked a little bit about Lonza in Europe. Green Bay packaging was $0.5 billion CapEx project, in which we're playing a major role here in the U.S.","In Automotive, I mentioned that the CapEx that they are releasing has contenders for the uses of that CapEx with some of the electric vehicle, autonomous vehicle development in addition to capacity moves and model changes, and that has resulted in some of the delays of the projects in Auto.","Our machinery builders and consumer continue to report healthy backlogs in their business, particularly in food and beverage. I mentioned Life Sciences. And so in general, there remains growth and there remains spending across the broad base of industries, automotive being a bit of the outlier particularly in North America.","Scott Graham","That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Blake Moret","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you.","Steve Etzel","Operator, we\u2019ll take one last question.","Operator","Great. Thank you. And your last question here comes from Justin Bergner from G. Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Bergner","Good morning and thank you for taking question. In addition to the Auto guides sort of bringing down your organic full year guide by about 50 basis points, are there any...","Patrick Goris","Hello? Justin, you've cut out.","Operator","And Justin Bergner, if you can press star 1 again to re-queue.","Justin Bergner","Hi. Hopefully, I'm live again. I was asking outside of Auto bringing down your full year organic guide by about 50 basis points. Are there any end markets that look materially better or worse with implicit in your full year outlook versus how they looked a quarter ago?","Patrick Goris","Justin, I would say no. There's always some puts and takes that move a little bit, but it's really Auto that was the big mover of all our verticals.","Justin Bergner","Okay. And on the segment margin performance the strong increase in the margin in Control Products & Solutions seem to absorb a mix headwind in terms of Solutions growth versus Products growth. Any sort of comment there on how you delivered such a good margin improvement while absorbing that mix headwind?","Patrick Goris","Yeah. So there was the modest headwind of mix between Control Products & Solutions. The main driver of the segment margin expansion was strong year-over-year organic sales growth, partially offset by higher spending. Those were really the big movers within that segment.","Justin Bergner","Okay. Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Justin.","Steve Etzel","Thank you. I'll turn it over to Blake for a few final comments.","Blake Moret","So just to summarize, we delivered 8% adjusted EPS growth driven by top line growth in all regions and in key verticals other than Automotive. Two of our larger strategic investments, PTC and Sensia are progressing well. We are accelerating the execution of our strategy. I'm very encouraged to see employees and partners embrace our new ways to win, expanding value for customers and share owners.","Steve Etzel","Okay. That concludes today's call.

Sales in our Product businesses continued to improve sequentially, and the Architecture & Software segment returned to year-over-year organic growth. Orders and sales in our Solutions & Services businesses, while still down year over year, came in as expected.","Globally, oil and gas and mining remained the weakest verticals, with oil and gas down about 25% year over year in the quarter. However, it appears these markets are stabilizing. Consumer and automotive both had good growth in the quarter. For automotive, this was the best year-over-year growth quarter of the year. Our powertrain initiative is yielding results and is contributing toward growth and share gains in this vertical.","From a regional perspective, in the U.S., our Product businesses continued to improve sequentially and were up year over year for the first time this year. Food and beverage and automotive were our strongest verticals in the U.S.","EMEA was down year over year in the quarter, a bit weaker than we expected, but order growth was strong and up mid-single digits year over year. Our performance in Asia was stronger than we expected, with growth in most countries in the region, including China, where we saw modest year-over-year growth for the first time this year. And as expected, our organic growth rate in Latin America slowed down. Continued growth in Mexico was offset by weakness elsewhere in the region, including Brazil.","A couple of additional comments about the quarter, our Process business was down 14% year over year, reflecting continued weakness in heavy industries. Logix was down 1% compared to last year but grew again sequentially. And I'm pleased with about 20% segment margin in the quarter, despite higher restructuring charges. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks.","Moving to the full year, fiscal 2016 was a challenging year, but I believe we executed well in difficult market conditions. Here are some key points. Throughout fiscal 2016, we've talked about significant declines in heavy industry verticals. Oil and gas was down about 25% for the year, mining mid-teens. Weak heavy industry performance impacted Process and Logix performance, which were down 15% and 4% for the year respectively.","Consumer verticals were up mid-single digits. This reflects our continued success with machine builders. After several strong years, automotive continued to grow, including the contribution from our powertrain initiative. And we saw double-digit growth in revenue streams related to new value from the connected enterprise. We'll talk more about that on Thursday at our Investor Day.","With respect to financial performance, we were able to keep our segment margin above 20% despite 7% lower reported sales. We had another good year of free cash flow conversion, over 100% of adjusted income. And we continued to return cash to shareowners, almost $900 million during fiscal 2016. Just last week, we announced a 5% increase in the annual dividend. This reflects our confidence in sustained free cash flow through the cycle.","To accelerate the execution of our strategy, we acquired three great companies during fiscal 2016. These acquisitions further strengthen our technology differentiation, increase our domain expertise, and expand market access. MagneMotion adds to our portfolio of innovative motion control solutions for consumer and transportation verticals. Automation Control Products adds new value to our software offering in applications across all industries, and Maverick Technologies adds expertise in chemical, consumer, life sciences, and oil and gas industry applications. I believe these acquisitions will help us grow market share.","Finally, I would like to thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their continued commitment.","Let's move on now to the fiscal 2017 outlook. I'll start with market conditions and economic indicators. Since the significant declines in early 2016, oil and commodity prices have somewhat recovered, and our business in heavy industry markets generally appears to have stabilized. Current forecasts call for improved global GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of global capital expenditures. We therefore expect improvement to continue into fiscal 2017, with continued growth in the consumer and auto verticals and with heavy industries about flat year over year.","Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 2% year over year. In addition, we project the acquisitions we made in 2016 to contribute significant growth. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2017 sales guidance of a little more than $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.85 to $6.25. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. I look forward to seeing many of you later this week at our annual Investor Day. As usual, we will hold Investor Day at Automation Fair, our main customer event, which will be in Atlanta this year. Coincidentally, Atlanta is my hometown. We again expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world for this year's Automation Fair. We will showcase our latest innovations, acquisitions, and information solutions, and highlight how the powerful combination of Rockwell Automation and our partners bring the connected enterprise to life.","Regardless of the macro environment, the secular tailwinds for automation remain intact and the opportunities provided by the connected enterprise are real. I believe we are best positioned to deliver the connected enterprise to our customers because we are already on the plant floor with a large installed base. We have differentiated technology and domain expertise, and we have a long history of successful partnerships. And the value we provide is in high demand, as every day customers are pulling us into their plans to connect their enterprise to become more competitive. We will continue to invest in technology and domain expertise to expand this value and profitably grow share, more on Thursday during Investor Day.","And with that, Ted.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. Good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments with page 4 of the fourth quarter key financial information.","Sales in the quarter were $1.539 billion, down 4.3% compared to Q4 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 4%. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points, and acquisitions increased sales by 40 basis points. Both the organic result and the currency impact were a little better than we expected.","Segment operating margin was 19.8%, down 1.1 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year over year was primarily due to lower organic sales and higher restructuring charges, partly offset by favorable mix.","Restructuring charges in the quarter totaled about $20 million, higher than the $10 million that we talked about in our last earnings call. We elected to go deeper with restructuring to help offset known earnings headwinds in fiscal year 2017 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to areas where we believe we have the best growth opportunities in the coming year. We expect these actions to generate gross savings of over $30 million in fiscal 2017 and over $40 million on a full run rate basis.","General corporate net expense was $25 million in Q4 compared to $20 million a year ago. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 23% compared to 28% in the fourth quarter last year. In Q4 this year, the adjusted effective tax rate was lower than last year but also better than we expected, primarily due to a more favorable mix of income across our global operations. Compared to Q4 last year, we also benefited this year from the R&D tax credit.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $1.57 in Q4 last year. The effect on adjusted EPS of lower operating earnings was partly offset by a lower tax rate and lower share count. Adjusted EPS of $1.52 was a few cents above the implied fourth quarter guidance, including the lower tax rate but despite the higher restructuring charges.","Free cash flow for Q4 was $235 million. That's another very good quarter. The rolling four-quarter return on invested capital was 33%.","Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 130 million. That's down 3% from Q4 last year. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $130 million.","Turning to page 5, this is the full-year version of the key financial information. Sales were $5.880 billion for the full year, down 6.8%. Organic sales declined 3.9%. Currency translation reduced sales by 3 points. Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.2%, down 1.4 points from last year. The primary factors were lower organic sales and the negative impact from currency effects, partly offset by lower incentive compensation expense.","Adjusted EPS was $5.93, down 7% compared to last year on the 7% reported sales decline. General corporate net expense was $80 million for the full year. That was about $5 million more than we talked about last quarter. Free cash flow for full year was $834 million, which was 107% of adjusted income, a little better than our targeted conversion and previous guidance.","For the full year, we repurchased a total of 4.6 million shares at a cost of $500 million. That's right on the $500 million target that we shared last November.","The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page 6. I'll start with the quarter performance. On the left side of this chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q4, up 1.8% from the same quarter last year. Organic sales increased 1.4%. Acquisitions increased sales by 1%, and currency translation reduced sales by 60 basis points. As Blake mentioned, this is the first quarter for year-over-year organic growth in the Architecture & Software segment in over a year.","Moving to the right side of the chart, Architecture & Software margins in the quarter were 25.8%, down 1.5 points from Q4 last year, and primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher restructuring charges. For the full year, A&S sales were down 4.2% as reported, with a 1.5% organic sales decline, a 30 basis point contribution from acquisitions, and currency translation reducing sales by 3%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 26.4%, down 3 points compared to prior year, primarily due to lower sales, unfavorable mix, and unfavorable currency effects.","Now on page 7, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were $842 million, down 8.8% year over year, with an organic sales decline of 8%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 80 basis points. The organic sales in the Product businesses in this segment grew by about 1%. Solutions & Services business sales declined by about 14%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for Solutions & Services was 0.92. That's better than the typical Q4 result but on a relatively weak billings denominator.","Operating margin was 14.8%, down 1.4 points compared to last year, primarily due to the significant organic sales decline, partly offset by productivity. For the full year, CP&S sales were down 8.8% year over year and down 5.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 3%. On an organic basis for the full year, Product sales in the segment were down about 2%, and Solutions & Services sales declined by about 8%. CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.2%, 30 basis points below 2015. This was a very good result despite an almost 9% drop in reported sales, and largely attributable to strong productivity performance in the year.","Page 8 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. Starting with the quarter, the U.S. was down about 7%, Canada down about 10%. In the U.S., our Product businesses grew year over year in Q4 for the first time in fiscal 2016. EMEA was down 3% but, as Blake noted, underlying orders were good and it was a relatively difficult year-over-year comparison. We saw about 5% growth in Asia-Pacific, with China growth a little below that, and with India up in the high single digits. This is the first quarter for organic growth in Asia-Pacific and in China in more than a year. Latin America was up about 1%. Mexico was up almost 10%, but that was largely offset by declines in Brazil and the balance of the region.","Moving to the full year, I'll try to provide some vertical color on the full-year results. In the U.S. and Canada, sales declined 7%. Across all regions this year, we experienced significant weakness in heavy industries, and that was particularly true in the U.S. For the company in total, oil and gas was down about 25% for the full year, but our largest decline in oil and gas occurred in the U.S., considerably worse than the company average. Similarly, mining, which was down mid-teens year over year for the company, was down over 20% in the U.S. The best growing verticals in the U.S. were food and beverage and life sciences.","In EMEA, organic sales were up 2% year over year, with 1% growth in the mature markets and almost 4% growth in the emerging markets. On a vertical basis, oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was down mid-single digit, and we saw particularly strong growth in life sciences and home and personal care.","In Asia-Pacific, we finished the year with sales down 5%. India saw double-digit growth, and China was down a little less than 10%. In Asia-Pacific, heavy industry verticals were down across the board except for water\/wastewater. Automotive, food and beverage, and life sciences were the best performing. Food and beverage was up about 20% year over year, primarily due to China.","In Latin America, sales increased 7% for the full year, with Mexico over 20% and Brazil down almost 10%. Oil and gas was down about 10%. Mining was about flat. We saw growth in most other verticals, with strong growth in auto and home and personal care. Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 1%, with growth in Latin America and EMEA emerging markets and declines in China.","And that takes us to the fiscal 2017 guidance slide. On the revenue side, here's how we're thinking about fiscal year 2017. We've seen solid sequential growth in our Product businesses over the last two quarters of fiscal year 2016. Orders in our Solutions & Services businesses seem to be reaching a bottom. From a vertical perspective, it appears that oil and gas and mining are stabilizing. We don't expect things to get better in fiscal year 2017, but we don't expect the drag in these industries that we experienced in 2016 to continue. We expect our business in auto and consumer industries to continue to grow.","We've always said that our business tracks best with levels of industrial production. Current forecasts of industrial production for fiscal year 2017 indicate growth of a little over 1%. That compares to a 20 basis point decline in industrial production in 2016. Generally, we expect to grow at a multiple of IP growth.","Blake mentioned that during 2016 we saw double-digit growth in some revenue streams related to the connected enterprise. We expect these revenue streams to continue to grow faster than the company average in fiscal 2017. With other share gain opportunities like powertrain and OEM, this will help us to continue to generate above-market organic growth.","Taking all of that into account, we expect organic growth in fiscal 2017 of about 2%. We expect acquisitions to add about 1.5 points of additional growth. We expect a minor headwind from currency, about a 50 basis point reduction to sales for full year. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming a euro rate of $1.09.","We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be a little over $6 billion. Our guidance range for organic growth is zero to 4%. We expect to see growth in all regions except Canada. We expect Canada to be about flat year over year in 2017. We expect slightly higher growth in the Product businesses than in our Solutions & Services businesses. And given the beginning backlog in our Solutions & Services businesses, for the company in total, we expect to see a lower rate of growth in the first half of the year and higher growth in the second half.","We expect segment operating margin to be about 20%, maybe a little bit lower. That's not our normal conversion, but we know we have margin headwinds to deal with in 2017, namely, the restoration of inventive compensation and increase in operating pension expense and unfavorable currency impact that's catching up to us from the rolling of currency hedges we had in place last year.","We expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be about 24%. That's a little higher than in 2016. The rate reflects recognition of an expected discrete benefit in the first quarter, so the rate will be lower in Q1 and higher over the balance of the year.","Our guidance range for adjusted EPS is $5.85 to $6.25. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%.","And a couple of items not shown here, general corporate net expense should be approximately $75 million in 2017. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 128 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Blake already talked about last week's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2017 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases in 2017.","The final page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. I think what's most relevant on this chart is that you can see graphically the fiscal 2017 earning headwinds we've been talking about over the past few quarters. The restoration of incentive compensation is about a $0.25 headwind, with pension, currency, and tax rate all at about $0.05, all together about $0.40 of headwinds. Based on our previous and ongoing share repurchases, we expect a tailwind of about $0.15 from share count. Along with the core contribution, that's the walk to the $6.05 at the midpoint for fiscal 2017. We expect the effect of the recent acquisitions to be about neutral to adjusted EPS, including acquisition-related costs.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Patrick and we'll begin Q&A.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Unknown Speaker","Operator. Certainly. Our first question today comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's actually Sawyer on for Nigel. I just wanted to drill into the guidance a bit more. I guess on a geographic basis, how should we be thinking about fiscal 2017 geographically, and how does the zero to 4% organic shake out across the regions?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, I think maybe addressing it at the midpoint of 2% organic, we would expect all of the regions to be close to that, but with Latin America probably a little above the average.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks, and then I guess just one more here on auto specifically. You highlighted that as a growth end market for next year. Should we expect North American auto to be positive into 2017? Thanks.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, we do. And again, the growth of our automotive industry sales is really more dependent on model changes than the SAAR [Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate] count. And we have good visibility to model changes around the world, but including the U.S.","Sawyer C. Rice - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. This is Dan on for Steve. How are you?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on the $0.35 expected for core growth next year, can you talk about the ability to toggle that depending on where you fall in the organic range? Basically meaning if you fall towards the low end of that organic, are there levers you can pull on margins to keep you close to that target, or is that $0.35 at the midpoint of 2% and it toggles that way?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We worked that bridge at the midpoint, but you could do a similar bridge at the low end of guidance. And the two things that would inflect at the lower end of guidance are both that core contribution and to some extent the incentive compensation.","Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then just a quick follow-up, can you walk us through the heavy industrial commentary for next year? Are there any verticals that are actually going to be down, or is that just a flattish trajectory across each of those end markets?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","If you look at our performance in 2016, it was largely oil and gas and mining that pulled down the heavy industry verticals. In the balance of heavy industry verticals, it was relatively flat, with some up a little bit and some down a little bit. I think what we're counting on in oil and gas and mining is we have had in oil and gas now about four quarters of relatively flat sales sequentially, and in mining, about three quarters of relatively flat sales sequentially. And when we get to Q1, we will have an easier comparison year over year in oil and gas, and by Q2, an easier comparison in mining.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Overall the heavy industries are expected to be flat to slightly down. We do get some contribution particularly in chemical and oil and gas from the Maverick Technologies acquisition.","Daniel J. Innamorato - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, all right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein New York. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning, all. I just want to make sure I understand $0.35 core growth at the midpoint on the bridge for next year. So that's something north I think of a 50% incremental margin in terms of how I should think about just the core growth. And I assume that the restructuring, the $10 million to $20 million \u2013 well, the $20 million of which $10 million was a little bit more than we had talked about last quarter, without that, the bridge would be that core incremental would be closer to, I guess 25%, without the full $20 million a little higher. I'm just trying to make sure I get your thinking on this. Is the restructuring a big piece of that benefit?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, so I think, Steve, you're right on. Part of that higher conversion is we'll probably guide about $15 million less restructuring charges reflected in 2017 than in 2016. And then in addition to that, we've got the restructuring savings that will impact 2017 favorably from the charges we took in Q4.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And those are probably the two major factors that cause that conversion to be a little bit higher than you might have otherwise expected.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, perfect, and then just a little bit of clarity on both maybe auto and then MRO versus CapEx overall. In auto, you guys had been calling out decelerating organic growth. I think it was 1% up last quarter, maybe 3% the quarter before that. Where did it actually come out now? And then just more broadly, what are you seeing again on the MRO side as opposed to CapEx?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Auto was up almost 10% in the quarter, globally.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And MRO versus CapEx, what kind of trends are you seeing on the MRO side?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Steve, is that question specific to auto or more generally?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No, more generally across the businesses.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It's hard because we sell so much through distribution that it's hard for us to know exactly what the split of CapEx is and MRO. But I referenced before that in oil and gas and mining, we've now seen three or four quarters of relatively flat sales. And I think that is a reflection of relatively stable MRO spending, small project spending, and then also investment in productivity improvement projects as opposed to new capacity.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","To add to that, I don't think we've seen anything to indicate a change in MRO spending in auto. What we are seeing is in that vertical particularly high uptake of some of the new value that we talk about with the connected enterprise. So adding information solutions that sit up on top of the basic control system, we're seeing really around the world a fairly rapid adoption of those additional sources of productivity.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And it's one of the things we'll talk about a little bit more on Thursday.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, just in terms of this product uptick you've seen in the last couple quarters, a lot of other companies are talking about the uncertainty weighing on spending out there and also the election obviously not helping. What are you hearing from customers? You're seeing these encouraging trends in products, which makes sense in some sense, but don't really foot with this uncertainty weight that other people are talking about. So maybe just a little more color on what customers are telling you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think there's stability in terms of some of the key industries. And remember, those product sales do get impacted by heavy industries as well as the consumer industries. But there's more optimism really on the consumer side, and we see the impact of new products as well having some benefit for us. So the new product releases, we've been talking about the investment for the last couple years. And we did see in 2016 and continuing into 2017 some important new products that are now available on the market.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It's hard for us to comment on what other companies are saying because geographic exposures and industry exposures are somewhat different. But we have seen a couple of encouraging quarters of sequential growth, particularly in the Product businesses. Obviously, it's been better in auto and consumer than it has been in heavy industry. I'd say what we have reflected in guidance is consistent with what we're hearing from customers about their capital spending plans.","As far as the election goes, we haven't talked to many people who are happy about the election, but I also haven't talked to many customers who are saying they're holding back spending specifically for that reason.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then within the oil and gas, I know your visibility is not always perfect if it's is going through distribution and things. But is there any difference within your products that you're selling to oil and gas? It seems like part of that market has stabilized and maybe even turned and other parts haven't. Are you seeing anything you can glean from the mix of what you're selling into that market in terms of what's improving and what's not?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No, I can't think of any significant mix change in the Product or Solutions set that we're selling into oil and gas.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Just to recap, our primary exposure is upstream and some in midstream, less in terms of control and downstream, although we do sell our intelligent motor control offerings as well as our process safety offerings in downstream, but we're not seeing any significant change in the mix. Again, we took some steps to increase our domain expertise, which impacts oil and gas primarily upstream and midstream.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, two questions, one on just Q1, if you could give us a little help, and then a strategic one after that. But not to put too fine a point on Q1, I'm sure you don't want to get into quarterly guidance. But given what you said about backlogs and book-to-bill, do you expect Q1 organic revenue growth to be in your annual growth band of zero to 4%? And I'm also just wondering, if you could, Ted, tell us what is the tax rate you're using in Q1.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So let me go to your first question about the growth rates. I don't think we're going to see year-over-year growth probably until Q2, and at best I think Q1 will be at the low end of the guidance growth range. Since we don't do quarterly guidance, I'm not going to do a Q1 tax rate, but the Q1 tax rate will be below the average for the full year.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then perhaps for Blake, but either who wants to take it, the acquisition of Maverick raised my eyebrows a little bit, the biggest independent systems integrator. It seems to rub a little bit against the grain of the Rockwell us-and-our-friends type approach to the market and maybe creates a channel conflict. Could you address that and how you view that, and does it actually reflect some fundamental change in your thinking?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It does not reflect a fundamental change in our thinking. We remain committed to strong support of our systems integrators and solutions providers. We've had really a dual approach to the market, particularly in process, for a long time now, in that for some industries and applications and even some specific customers, they do expect the manufacturer of the control equipment to have the domain expertise to be able to most efficiently apply that technology. But we recognize and remain committed to strong support of independent engineering firms for integrating those products as well. Particularly in the process space, there's not as much of an integrator footprint in the U.S. or around the world. On balance, the integrators are typically a little more focused on discrete applications, but in no way does this signify a rollup of our integrators either in process applications or in general.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. Firstly, I just wanted to ask around the trends you saw monthly, if there was any notable difference since the end of the June in any region or end market, or whether the trends you saw on orders and sales were pretty steady in the last four months.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Julian, generally, conditions improved as we moved through the quarter, but that's pretty typical for any quarter for us and particularly so for Q4.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And October is consistent with our guidance as well.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Right.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood, thank you. And then secondly, I guess, China, you had a very good return to growth. That echoed what some of your peers have talked about last week. I just wondered if you could give us any color around which end markets drove that pickup and how you think about the sustainability of that growth, as your numbers in China have been very volatile in the last few years.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","A lot's been said about the growth of the consumer vertical in China, and we continue to see that and automotive as the engines of our growth there. And I mentioned before about around the world customers in addition to the basic control systems that they're adding or upgrading, adding the additional information solutions on top in their overall platform. And we're seeing particularly high adoption in China, and specifically in consumer verticals like Life Sciences as well as in the automotive industry. And in fact, the adoption rate is probably higher than in any other place in the world, as those manufacturers, including indigenous manufacturers, are trying to move more rapidly up the productivity curve than other economies did in the past.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So it's more of I guess the structural element is overcoming any short-term cyclical weakness?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, I think what we're seeing is the long-term trends towards a consumer industry to support the growing middle class playing out in China.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, good morning, Blake, Ted, Patrick.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just two questions, one around auto, a very good quarter. And is there any way to just dissect maybe the growth rate by the conventional maybe paint content and spend level versus the share gains on the powertrain side? And I guess where I'm going with the question is how much room do we have to run with the share gains? We're not peak shipments or anything there on the share gains, do we, relative to the capital investment going into Mexico?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","There's plenty of room to run on these share gains. And so I don't know that we can break down specifically the percentage of growth. We've talked about a $20 million incremental opportunity in powertrain on a yearly basis. But we think it's fairly balanced in terms of our ability to grow share due to powertrain as well as capitalizing on model changes and identified programs around the world.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Rick, the other thing, I think Patrick mentioned 10% growth in automotive in the quarter. I wouldn't get overly excited about the 10% in the quarter. It tends to be a project-related business for us. There's some lumpiness in project timing, and so we were really pleased with the results in the quarter. I would say what we're more pleased with is full-year growth in automotive in 2016, and so don't draw too big of a conclusion on one quarter's results.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, I understand. And just as a follow-up, given the Solutions book-to-bill at 0.92, that's reasonably typical. And I think, Ted, you made the comment that the second half growth in the Solutions business would be better than the first half. But is the first half for the CP&S in total and Solutions, is it still likely to be a negative number?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. I think in the first half of the year, we will have modestly negative growth rates in Solutions & Services businesses probably.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then averaging into the full year, does CP&S show growth if the midpoint 2% becomes a reality, the CP&S growth?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","At the 2% midpoint, I think CP&S will show some growth, but it will likely be below the average, and A&S we would expect to be a little above the average.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Understood, okay. All right, thank you and nice quarter. Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. A lot of your big process customers have started to generate cash again; at least they're getting their act together a bit. You've gotten flattish revenue from heavy industries. But can you talk about the potential for an uptick in large project activity? Have customers given any indication to you on when you could see larger heavy industry projects, particularly in mining go-forward again and when you could see more orders?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We're seeing activity, but it's a little hard to say when money will actually be released for those projects because what we've seen in the past is during periods where capital expansion is lower, then the engineers are busy getting ready for future projects, and they have the time to do that as opposed to keeping \u2013 running at very high levels of output. We've seen some evidence that there's a little more productivity spending in mining in Latin America, but no signs of a major uptick in capital expenditures. And just to be clear, what we look at as a big project, it's not all that big. We're not playing in the mega-projects more than to be providing the capacity specifically related to controls as well as productivity on brownfields.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful. And then you saw a pretty big swing in EMEA, with growth turning negative after mid-single-digit positive last quarter. We did see a slowdown from some of our other industrial companies in Europe, but you mentioned that you saw mid-single-digit organic order growth in the quarter. So it seems \u2013 you'd think that the sales weakness in EMEA is maybe more temporary, more a hiccup than anything else. Can you give us more color on what you're seeing there in Europe? And the visibility, I think you mentioned relatively flattish for 2017, but maybe you can talk a little bit more about that.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We do think a lot of that is variability. We think that the optimism that we've seen \u2013 I was in Europe last month with our employees and some customers as well. I think we're continuing to see the impact, particularly in the consumer applications of some of our new product releases. They're making a difference.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Blake, is the Middle East holding you back at all? Is it weaker than the rest of Europe?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I would say the only change we have seen in the Middle East is there has been some pullback in infrastructure investment.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning, all, just two questions for me.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","For fiscal 2017 automotive and consumer, what's the underlying assumption for the growth rates for those particular verticals?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Without getting overly specific, I think you ought to think of it as we expect both the company average growth in automotive and consumer and below the company average growth in heavy industry, and with heavy industry relatively flat, maybe even slightly down.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Auto and consumer we're looking at up mid-single-digits globally for 2017.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, all right. And then just a follow-on to an earlier comment, Blake, around China, you talked about information solutions and there's more adoption of the product over there seemingly, rather, versus the developed markets. I'm just curious. What do you think is driving that? What do you think the hindrances are right now around developed market adoption, Europe, North America specifically, around the information solutions and software product?","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","When I talked to customers in China over the last couple of years, I've been told by some of them that what took the Western economies and the U.S. 40 or 50 years to work to high levels of productivity, they want to do in much less time. And I think a lot of those customers are committed to and with the encouragement of the government to more rapidly adopt additional sources of productivity.","So it's certainly about the base automation. But when you look at initiatives like China Manufacturing 2025, those are really good fits with what we talk about with the connected enterprise vision. And in fact, just again there in August, having joint presentations for indigenous customers about the linkage of the connected enterprise with the China Manufacturing 2025 initiative, particularly around those information solutions, the addition of MES software, higher-value services to complement the products and the software, those ideas resonate with the customers. And beyond that, there's a growing number of them that can talk about how it actually achieved the business outcomes that they were looking for. And we'll talk about some of those on Thursday, but it's real and it's having an impact on their overall competitiveness.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you think there's going to be much more of a lag or resonance in the developed markets, Blake? I know you'll probably talk about this later in the week.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","It's the pilot concept. And for each customer, it's an individual journey, so they're picking up these concepts at a different state of readiness. Some of them already have the smart products installed. Others it's just getting the basic communication infrastructure in to create the plumbing, if you will, for the data that's turned into information. But we're seeing that pull that I mentioned before bringing us into those pilots. It's highly iterative. There's not a set playbook for the industries. Each customer is looking for a partner to work through this with them, and that's why it's taking a while. But we do see the adoption and the momentum building.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. See you next week \u2013 later in the week.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","See you soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Ashay on for Joe Ritchie, just one quick question for me. Can you remind us where pricing ended up for 2016 and what your underlying assumption is in the FY 2017 guidance? Thank you.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, so for 2016, pricing was a little less than a point, and basically we're expecting a similar result in 2017.","Ashay Gupta - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks and good morning, everyone.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Congratulations on the three acquisitions. It's good to see capital going to acquisitions, and I think you've had a pretty good 2016 in that respect. And from your prepared remarks, it sounded like you may be seeing other acquisition opportunities in this new fiscal year. Ted, you talked about lower share repurchase in fiscal 2017 depending on acquisition spend. So, I'm wondering if you could help us understand what you're seeing out there. Now that you own Maverick, there may not be a large opportunity \u2013 or as large opportunities on the system integration side.","And, Blake, if you could comment on your willingness to maybe do somewhat bigger deals. There's a number of attractive segments of the industrial automation industry that you're maybe not participating in today. So I'm trying to understand your appetite there. Thanks.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure, I will be talking some more specifically about the role of these acquisitions and others on Thursday. But briefly, we remain primarily an organic growth company. There's no better way for us to spur our growth in performance than growth in our core platforms. That being said, the pace of the technology and the demands of customers that they have on their automation and information partners for credibility and an understanding of their best opportunities for productivity do put a little additional emphasis on acquiring and partnering for new technology and domain expertise. So it's more about the accelerated pace of the technology that may spur a little bit more activity on the acquisition side. But again, our priorities remain first, organic growth, and then in terms of capital acquisitions, followed by dividend and share repurchase.","So I don't want to signal \u2013 I'm not signaling an interest in going after something big. We're not constrained. But our first priority is when we do consider acquisitions are how do they accelerate our existing strategy? How do they bring us technology, innovation? How do they increase our domain expertise? How do they increase our market access? And so the best acquisitions address one or more of those areas, and then we look secondarily about their impact on some portion of our financial structure.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, and a pleasant surprise from Asia-Pacific. This quarter you talked about improving trends in China. I know you've made some changes there in terms of senior leadership in recent quarters. I wonder if you could talk about your strategy in China and any changes there in terms of your approach to distribution. It sounds like you're doing well with machine builders. You're seeing a nice take-up of your information solutions there. Maybe give us more color on your approach to distribution. Thanks very much.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Sure. We remain committed to limited market-making distribution around the world, and we have seen some optimism coming from our distributors and from our salespeople who are working with distributors. We also see the need to increase our own capabilities, particularly when we're having these more unstructured discussions about the connected enterprise. So we can't depend entirely on our distributors to make that market for us. And so we're investing in people who have skills in that area and have the expertise in the applications and the technology for driving that additional productivity.","And we're looking at partners as well. Engineering companies, when they see the value of working with us, they can be a very credible source of information and value-add for those customers as well. So it's a broad approach. It remains one that includes distribution at its core, but it also includes developing our own capabilities as well as developing deeper relationships with key engineering firms.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks very much and good luck, guys.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Our final question today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow. Please go ahead.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thank you.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","One clarification, you said the tax rate would be 24% with a benefit in the first quarter. Are we headed back towards mid-20s? And when you get past 2018, are we going to normalize the tax rate?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Eli, I think we've talked about this in the past. If you ask what I think more a long-term base tax rate is for us, I think it's more like in the 26% to 27% range.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thanks for doing that. And as we looked at the businesses, you talk about mining getting better. You have a very small exposure to coal I believe, but there's no exposure going up with any of the bankruptcies. And there's basically, with the coal market still in shambles, that it shouldn't have much of an effect in 2017, and with the auto business up by itself ex the powertrain business in 2017.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We're talking about a $20 million opportunity in powertrain for us annually. If you think about our automotive business as being ballpark, $600 million \u2013 $650 million of our total sales, you can do the math yourself. Without powertrain, there would be significantly lower growth.","Blake D. Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And going back to your first question about coal, you're right. Our exposure to coal is fairly low. It was a little bit more in China, but I would say it's decreased quite a bit over the last couple of years, and we don't expect additional exposure to coal in the U.S. or elsewhere.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right, thank you very much.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay, that concludes today's call.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thank you, Sonia. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. Additionally, a webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","With me today, as always, are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda today includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the third quarter as well as an update on the remainder of the fiscal year. Then Ted will provide more details around the quarter and our revised guidance for fiscal 2012. We'll then take questions at the end of Ted's remarks.","We know it's been a busy earnings week for all of you, so we appreciate you calling in today. We expect the call to take about an hour. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. My remarks will cover highlights for the quarter, our assessment of business conditions and an updated outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.","We delivered solid 7% organic growth in the third quarter with organic growth in all regions. Operating margin expanded almost 1 point, and the earnings per share grew 9% or 13%, if you exclude the headwind from a higher tax rate. So overall, a good quarter in the midst of a more challenging macroeconomic environment.","Let me give you some color on sales in the quarter.","Generally, all regions came in at the lower end of our growth rate expectation, reflecting a slowing of market demand. The U.S. was stable, with 6% organic growth, and Canada had another robust quarter of 24% growth.","EMEA held up reasonably well with 3% organic growth in spite of deteriorating macroeconomic condition. While parts of Western Europe declined in the quarter, emerging EMEA had very strong double-digit growth.","In Asia, we actually saw stronger growth in mature countries than in emerging. While China did grow sequentially, 5% year-over-year growth in the quarter was below our expectation. The government's stimulus actions have yet to jump start economic growth. We continue to believe that China will rebound to higher growth rate, but it now appears more likely to happen after our Q4.","India remained weak and sales were down in the quarter. We have yet to see evidence of improvement in their economy.","Lastly, Latin America organic sales growth of 5% in the quarter fell considerably short of our expectation. Most of the sales shortfall was in Brazil, which is experiencing an economic slowdown and has led to delays in customer spending. Mexico, on the other hand, was a bright spot, with over 30% growth.","I have a few other third quarter highlights. Our Process business delivered another good quarter of sales growth at 15%. On a year-to-date basis, sales are up 20% in Process. In June, the board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization, and we increased the dividend by 11%. Both of these actions demonstrate our ongoing commitment to returning excess cash to shareholders.","Ted will provide more detail on third quarter financial performance in his remarks. So I'll move on to our revised outlook.","Every quarter, we do an extensive review with our sales and business leaders as well as a pulse check with our channel partners and key customers to try to get a read on current and future business condition. Although none of us has a crystal ball, we use this feedback along with macro indicators and our recent performance to develop our outlook for the remainder of the year.","So what is all of this telling us?  On the macroeconomic side, whether you look at GDP, industrial production growth or PMI, most of the indicators have weakened from 1 quarter ago. Customer and channel sentiment is generally less positive than 1 quarter ago. Most of the signs point to a flattening of cluster demand, at least in the short term. And although sales growth was solid in Q3, we started to see more projects getting pushed out. While there are project delays in every quarter, they seemed to pick up in the third quarter.","So keeping all of this in mind, along with an increasing headwind of currency, we are reducing our sales outlook for the fiscal year to about $6.2 billion. Correspondingly, we are revising our fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance range to $5 to $5.20, with about $0.05 of the reduction coming from currency. Even with the guidance revision, sales and earnings in this range represent another record year for the company.","It is clear that we are in an environment of considerable macroeconomic and political uncertainty. We are closely monitoring market condition and are focused on how the fourth quarter will play out. We have proven we know how to be nimble in times of economic uncertainty and will continue to balance near-term financial performance with growth opportunity.","At the end of the day, automation remains a great market, and our competitive differentiation positions us well to outgrow the underlying market. If historical cyclical patterns have any relevance, we would expect to see at least another 2 years in this cycle.","Let me close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. Their dedication and domain expertise is core to our value proposition for customers. That is what will enable us to continue to gain market share and deliver superior returns to our shareholders.","Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised guidance for 2012. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides on the website, and I'll be starting with Slide 5, the third quarter results summary.","Revenue in the quarter was $1,560,000,000.  That's up 3% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 4 points. That's a much more negative impact from currency than earlier this year and more negative than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The decline of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar is causing the largest part of that difference.","Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 8% compared to a year ago. General Corporate net was $19 million, that compares to $22.3 million in Q3 last year. This Q3 was somewhat lower than average quarter for General Corporate net expense, primarily just timing. We still expect the full year General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million.","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.1%. There were some discrete items that reduced the rate in the quarter. Year-to-date, the effective rate was 23.8%. So through 9 months, we're running very close to our full year expectation of 24%. Last year in Q3, the tax rate was 19.1%, also lower due to the recognition of discrete items.","Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.33, up $0.09 compared to Q3 last year and despite the higher tax rate.  Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 143.5 million, that's down about 2.4 million shares from the average of Q3 last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million of shares at a cost of about $121 million. Year-to-date, through the end of June, we've repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares at a cost of about $170 million.","The increased rate of repurchases in Q3 is generally consistent with the intentions that we outlined in the earnings call at the end of April.","Moving to Slide 6, this is a more graphical representation of total company results for the third quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year increase in sales for Q3 was 3%, 7% x currency. Reported sales were flat sequentially but up about 1 point, excluding currency translation.","On the right side of the slide, you can see a healthy increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. Segment operating margin was 18.2% in the quarter, up 0.8 points compared to last year and up 1 point sequentially. The year-over-year margin expansion reflects volume leverage, partly offset by increased spending and unfavorable mix. We also benefited in Q3 from lower incentive compensation expense, including year-to-date adjustments related to reduced expectations for full year sales and earnings. It's a similar year-over-year margin causal in each of the segments.  Through 3 quarters, segment operating margin is 18.2%, up 1.4 points from the same 9 months of last year.","Let's move to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q3 results for the Architecture & Software segment. The left side of the chart displays the sales performance. Sales were $664 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by about 4 points, so organic sales growth was approximately 3%. Sales were flat sequentially.","Operating margin for the quarter was 27.5%, up 1.4 points compared to Q3 last year. Year-to-date operating margin in Architecture & Software is 27.1 points -- or 27.1%, up almost 2 points from the same period last year.","Let's turn to Slide 8 results for the Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $897 million in the quarter, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. The increase included about 1 point contribution from acquisitions, offset by about a 5-point reduction due to currency. So an organic sales increase of 10%.","Solutions and services businesses grew about 16% organically year-over-year, contributing the lion's share of the dollar growth. Sales in this segment were flat sequentially. Segment operating earnings were $102 million, an increase of 16% compared to Q3 last year, with segment operating margin at 11.3%, up almost a full point from a year ago.","Year-to-date, Control Products & Solutions operating margin is 11.5%, up 1.3 points compared to last year.","The next slide provides a look at regional sales performance. Keith provided a good deal of color on the regional sales performance, so I won't repeat that. Perhaps just a couple of comments.","Looking at the difference between the growth rates in the middle column, that's the as-reported year-over-year comparison, and in far right column, which is x currency, you'll note the significant negative impact from currency, particularly in EMEA and Latin America, and the largest impact in Latin America coming from Brazil.","In EMEA, with ex-currency growth at 5%, we benefited from about a 2-point contribution from acquisitions year-over-year. And to reinforce a point that Keith made, maybe the most positive message from this slide is the organic growth in all regions.","I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $232 million, that's about 122% of net income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the $300 million discretionary pension contribution that we made in quarter 1. We would expect conversion to be about 100% excluding that pension contribution.","And that brings us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for the full year. As Keith mentioned, we've reduced the narrowed sales and earnings guidance. We now expect sales for the full year of about $6.2 billion. Think of that as a range of $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion, and that compares to the previous guidance of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. We now expect currency translation to reduce sales by about 3 points for the full year. Previous guidance assumed a 2-point decrease due to currency. Across the sales guidance range, there's about a $50 million negative impact from currency compared to the prior guidance.","Excluding currency effects, we expect growth for the full year of about 6% to 7%.  Previous guidance was 6% to 9%. We still expect segment margin to be a little over 18%. As I mentioned earlier, we're at 18.2% year-to-date. And we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5 to $5.20. As Keith mentioned, currency effects are reducing EPS across the guidance range by about $0.05 compared to the prior guidance.","We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect General Corporate net expense to be about $90 million for the full year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, great. Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] Okay. So, Sonia, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the -- I guess, the margin in A&S was pretty good despite weaker-than-expected sales than I had. Can you maybe talk about that? And then it looks like in the fourth quarter, on the kind of decline in revenues, you're just basically assuming that there's a kind of 30% to 40% incremental to get to the 18% margin. Is that kind of how you're looking at it?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, let me take your first -- I'm sorry, Steve, on you second question, you're asking about Q4?","Unknown Analyst","Yes, the Q4 guide looks like it's basically just a sales decline and then a decremental margin of like 30% to 40% or something like that.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, so let me take the A&S question first. So A&S margins were up about 2 points sequentially. Even though reported sales were down slightly, there was positive organic growth, and that had some attractive conversion. We also had somewhat better mix sequentially. We've talked about the unfavorable mix in Q2. And the incentive comp that I mentioned also favorably impacted margins sequentially a bit. So I mean, that kind of explains the A&S margin performance in the quarter. As it relates to incrementals in Q4, especially when you get small sales changes and negative changes, the incrementals start to get a little funky. But basically, I would say if you think about the sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 that we're going to get a little bit -- at mid-point, a little bit of organic volume growth. And that's going to be offset largely by unfavorable mix.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then one last question on that fourth quarter. How are you looking at this? Are you just saying, I mean, normal seasonality in the upturn is usually higher than what you've guided to. Obviously, if you look back over a 10-year period, there's some pretty weak seasonal moves, when things turned down. But are you kind of just assuming kind of normal seasonality with the hedge? Is there -- what exactly have you been seeing in kind of June and July that makes you kind of set that bar for the fourth quarter? And is that just the view of the macro or just curious as to how you set that?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think, at the mid-point, basically, what we're expecting is products to be kind of flat quarter-to-quarter, and then we're expecting kind of a normal seasonal plop in the Solutions business. But clearly, last Q4 was a much larger-than-normal increase. We're not expecting to see that same kind of increase this Q4.","Unknown Analyst","And is that Solutions comp visible?","Theodore D. Crandall","When you say visible, I mean, well, when you say invisible, I mean, think about -- whatever we're going to do in Q4 in Solutions is pretty much in the backlog at the end of Q3.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You referenced, Keith, you mentioned project delays in 3Q increasing. Are there any common themes behind that? Like, for example, I don't think we've seen any decline, really, in Process, per se, from any of the other guys, but is it auto? Is it hybrid? Anything that you can kind of glean from that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I don't believe there's any one common theme there. If you look at what is happening, it's a little bit more regional in nature. In the U.S., we are seeing some project, I'll say, really front-log pushouts, particularly in paper and metals. The ongoing small project business is good in the U.S. So little different there in the fact that it's really the front-log pushout that we're seeing. Probably where the most significant changes are occurring, and all of this is based upon our expectations where, in particular, in Asia, we were expecting to see some acceleration of projects in the second half of the year, and that's not occurring. And so we're seeing both backlog and front-log pushouts in projects in Asia. We associate a lot of that with just the market conditions, the macroeconomic conditions, mainly in China and India, and the liquidity issues in both of those countries as well. And it just, in particular, in China -- we weren't expecting anything in India. But in China, we thought we would see that acceleration, and in fact, we have not. So from our expectation, it's been lower, even though we had growth in China. In Latin America, probably the biggest impact is what we're seeing in Brazil, and that's not so much -- in Latin America, it's not so much in the large projects such as the oil and gas and the mining projects, which tend to be very long-term investments, and those don't really move much at the end of the day. It's more in the shorter-term projects, particularly, in Brazil, where they're struggling with both the high interest rates and also the real currency that is making some of their exporting manufacturing less competitive. So that tends to be a little bit of color around what we're seeing in the project delays as we go forward here.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. Keith, as a follow-up, just -- when you think about the upcoming election, I mean, your customers, particularly in the States, talking about the election as kind of a catalyst to delay projects and just wait and see what policy is going to be? Is that -- is there any impact there that you guys see as tangible?","Keith D. Nosbusch","It's hard to say what's tangible there. But I think as all of us know, the uncertainty that is existing at this point in time with what will occur at the end of the year or the start of the year, particularly in the U.S., doesn't create a lot of confidence for investment. And as I said, I don't think we have anything tangible, but we do hear that, that uncertainty is causing a little more cautiousness in their outlook and therefore, in their spending patterns and commitment patterns. So I think it is having at least some psychological impact at this point in time. And as people start preparing for the end of the year or the start of the year, it will be weighing on their investment decisions.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mr. Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Keith, you talked about some negative mixes occurring within A&S. Could you maybe just elaborate on that, please?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, we talked about a different mix between last quarter and this quarter, which improved some of the margins. And that was really some less growth in our motion business, which is related more to some of the OEMs and, in particular, some of the OEMs in Europe, which are slowing, and likewise, associated with OEMs, some of our safety component businesses slowed for that same reason. They're very tightly connected together at the OEM segments. So that was the mix comment that I think Ted referred to in his commentary.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then, if you look into 4Q and maybe beyond, I realize the visibility is quite low, but anything on the mix side that you want to highlight?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, I think, from our perspective, at least, in Q4, we would expect to see a reasonable, consistent mix. And I guess you're referring to just A&S. But we do expect Logix to probably grow above the average in the segment, because we believe motion will still be a little slower, particularly with what we're seeing with respect to the German OEM machinery export expectations and what is going on in Italy. So I think, we're expecting to see probably a similar mix content in Q4 that we saw in Q3 for A&S. If we take it at a macro level, we're obviously expecting -- a company level, we're obviously expecting Solutions to be a higher content in our Q4 and, as Ted mentioned, that the predominant growth in the quarter will come from Solutions businesses that are already in backlog.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Keith, you mentioned growing uncertainties caused partially by the election in the U.S. Are you seeing that uncertainty in the channel? Are you starting to see some more careful management of inventories?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, in the U.S., in particular, and U.S. -- well, in North America, in particular, we have very good visibility in the channel behaviors, and we're not seeing any deviation in what we would expect for the normal volume levels that are occurring. And we continue to see appropriate both levels and behavior in the channel.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass, Longbow Research.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Keith, can you highlight what Logix growth was in the quarter?  And what are you expecting for the full year in Logix?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, Logix growth in the quarter was -- organic growth was 3%, about the same as A&S organic growth with -- but for the full year, we would expect to see high-single-digit growth from Logix.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then looking ahead with the growing uncertainty, I assume you're being -- at least, thinking about any possible measures as far as cost controls.  Is it too soon for you to be thinking about that? Or just can you explain what you're looking -- what you're expecting for that, maybe into 2013?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, first, we are operating the business in a manner that's consistent with the guidance, which is basically that we're entering a slower growth environment. So we -- and with the limited visibility, as you said, but given the current trends, we do have all of our businesses and functions looking at what type of contingency plans they can put in place in the event that market conditions get worse. But at this point, we're still operating the business, as we're moving into a slower growth period. And we still want to make the prudent decisions based upon balancing financial performance with longer-term growth opportunities. So at this point, we're making sure that we're doing our -- what's prudent, which is to look at the opportunities, and we really want to watch what is going on in Q4 here to get a better picture of what to anticipate in fiscal year '13.","D. Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then you haven't throttled anything back quite yet?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No.  I mean, obviously, we slowed spending, just like the growth rates. And quite candidly, that's part of the reasons why we've been able to have a reasonable margin performance this year, even with the decline in revenue, I should say, the reduction in revenue growth. So yes, we are slowing our spending and we're not spending at the level we had in the plan currently.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Keith, following up on an earlier question regarding regional trends with project pushouts. What's going on in Europe? What are you seeing there? You mentioned some other regions. Just curious to see what you're seeing in Europe, if it's taken a decent step back or what the color is there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, in Europe, we're -- actually, we're very pleased with the organic growth. I mean, it's 3%. But the fact that we're still growing in a very, very tough environment is very encouraging for us, and we're very pleased with the team's work there to make this happen. We are seeing the slowdown in Western Europe. Some of the countries are seeing a much more difficult environment. As you would expect, Southern Europe is -- it's tougher than it was in the earlier part of the year. But we are seeing the growth in emerging Europe, and we see projects continuing to be moving forward. There's not really a slowdown with respect to -- particularly, oil and gas has been very strong. And also, some of the metals markets in the Middle East continue to be strong. And once again, these are generally large projects that don't get moved simply because of a short-term issue. They tend to be longer-term, decade-type investments, and they tend to continue to move forward. And we haven't seen any delay in that. In Europe, the delay is -- more of it has been in what I would call some of the consumer industries. Auto, as all of you know, is struggling more in Europe with the overcapacity. You've seen recent print -- recent articles about the taking offline of some of their capacity. And so we're seeing a little bit of a slowdown there. But Europe, in automotive, is probably not as strong for us as any other region in the world. So it's probably less of an impact to us. But along that line, tire goes pretty close with automotive, and we're seeing slowdowns there, which does impact some of the OEM activity in Europe. And then food and beverage, the consumer products areas are also starting to see more slowdown and pushout of projects. So that's kind of what we're seeing in the European front.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just a couple of housekeeping. On the Logix comment, is that high-single-digit growth rate organic or total? And then what was the Solutions book-to-bill for the quarter or at the end of the quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","The Logix growth is an organic growth rate, and the book-to-bill was 1 for the quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of follow-on thoughts. Your comment about kind of operating as if you're in a slow-growth environment was clear. I also wondered if you'd kind of put that, though, in context to your higher-level thought that kind of a normal cycle might have 2 more years to go. I mean, clearly, this one doesn't feel as normal. And I just wonder if you could draw some parallels to prior periods if you, in fact, see any parallels in the way your business and\/or customers are acting relative to what you may have seen in the past.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, first of all, as I'm sure you've been thinking and understand is none of these ever are the same, so. But certainly for us, this feels more like a pause and a slowing of growth as opposed to a fundamental downturn at this point in time. And so, obviously, the most recent memory that we have is-- back in '08. And I think there's some meaningful differences than what we saw at that point in time. For example, back in '08, we had, at least in the U.S., we had 2 major car companies on the verge of bankruptcy. We had a very strong bubble in the housing sector, and we were getting close to but not yet in the financial crisis that occurred later in the fall. And at this point -- and today, we don't see any of those. And more importantly, most companies' balance sheets are very strong. So they have an ability to, I think, easier ride through a slowdown and yet continue to spend in the appropriate areas that make sense. So we really aren't, at this point, seeing similarities to '08 other than what we talked about a little earlier, which is there are some project delays. And while a lot of that is normal, we did see a little push-up of that, a push-up of that in our third quarter. But certainly, given the macro and political environment, at this point, we just feel that that's just a normal course of action that we would expect companies to be taking. So we're obviously very focused on Q4 and to get a better read of what's occurring, and that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with our spending at this point in time. But we're still expecting growth, and we are expecting that the cycle will continue, although we don't know the shape of it at this point in time.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just following along on that. Were the trends in June similar to what you saw throughout the quarter or was there a meaningful change in June and early July?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, there wasn't really a meaningful change. We had  a very strong margin, as you remember, from the last call. And so April was a little weaker because of that. But the business progressed at an increasing rate through the quarter. Unfortunately, not at the rate we had anticipated at the last call. So we saw a continued growth through June. And certainly, what we're seeing in July is consistent with what we've outlined in the guidance. So really, no fundamental change other than the slowing of growth, particularly in some of the key emerging markets that we did anticipate. We talked about China accelerating. We're not seeing anything unique in India that we didn't expect. But China, not as fast a growth in recovery. And Brazil in a  worse situation than we would have -- than we certainly had anticipated in the previous quarters. So other than those nuance -- not nuances, those areas, in general, just the slowing and just the rate of increase was different than we anticipated at the start of the quarter.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just one other real quick one, and I'll get off. The kind of the okay performance in Europe, as you put it, decent, given the backdrop, do you think that in any way reflects your OEM machine builders beginning to benefit from euro weakness from an export standpoint?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, I think, it's more of a -- I think, partially -- not partially, it is definitely the OEMs where our success is and why we believe we're outperforming. And that's -- and it's not so much because of the currency. Those types of -- that doesn't cause a reaction as quick in the marketplace as just the change of the rates in 1 quarter. There is a selling cycle. There is a build cycle that has to come into play and an order cycle that comes into that as well. So we wouldn't see that quick of a reaction. We believe that the performance in Europe is really because of what we've done in the last couple of years, to build and to focus on OEMs. And in particular, the success we see is driven less by the currency and more by the strength of exporting OEMs. And certainly, if you look at the performance of the machinery builders in Europe, the domestic market is very weak, and what has been supporting it in the last couple of quarters -- supporting the industry in the last couple of quarters has been exporting. And exporting to the U.S. and exporting to Latin America with a somewhat of a decline in the exports. Asia, particularly China, and the domestic market has weakened. So it's played to our strength, and more importantly, played to the areas that we focused on in the last couple of years. And we believe that's been one of the areas that we've been able to create share gain and one of the reasons why we've been able to continue to grow in a very, very difficult economy there.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a first quick question on that -- those margins, on the incrementals.  To what extent that price and cost contribute to the incremental performance? I know you talked about organic growth, but if I sort of think about separating price cost versus productivity versus just leverage on the fixed cost base.","Theodore D. Crandall","I mean, price was positive in the quarter. And I would say, year-to-date, we're pretty much on track to hit our expectations of about 1 point. Cost is probably running a little bit favorable year-to-date, and I would say increasingly favorable as we proceed through the year. Now some of that we expected at the beginning of the year. And it really reflects just some easing of commodity costs. I would say price cost performance in total is probably about neutral for us against the guidance that we talked about last quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And do you expect that to continue for the rest of the -- for the fourth quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","We do.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just stepping back a little bit here. I know you're waiting for fourth quarter results to give you more certainty about how to proceed. But if you think about -- should you continue to see global deceleration, and you think about the playbook this time versus, I guess, '09 when you were down something like, what, 19% or 20% organically and the EBIT or operating profit was down more than, I guess, 60%, how do you think about that? Should you -- not that bad, but should we start to see that further deceleration? And you think about that margin versus growth investment trade-off. What should investors expect is a difference this time in terms of how you manage that trade-off?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, quite candidly, I don't think you should expect any difference. We definitely understand the need to respond to the short-term environment that we're operating in. On the other hand, we also understand that, as a technology company, we need to continue to make investments, particularly in our core platforms and in our customer-facing resources. And while we may not add there, we certainly want to maintain at a very meaningful level the investments that we're making, particularly in emerging markets, where we have to continue to build our capabilities and, certainly, in the core technologies that our customers are counting on. But more importantly, that's what gives us the competitive differentiation. And quite frankly, it's one of the reasons we came out of the last downturn as strong as we did. So we want to make sure we continue to maintain the proper investment levels and deal with the current economic situation appropriately, but not at the expense of prolonging the recovery and the benefits of new products and new customers in the upturn. And quite frankly, we never experienced the speed and depth of the decline that we saw in 2009. So the decrementals that you talked about were probably much higher than, I guess, I would call normal, although, as I said earlier to one of the questions, I don't know if there is a normal anymore. But we certainly are not expecting, anticipating or even thinking that we're in that type of a situation current.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right, okay. And maybe just a follow-up to the Logix growth point. You talked about 3%. How does that compare to your expectations and penetration and share gain, given the broader market challenges? Is it on pace and the trajectory's similar to -- you're still tracking to more than $1 billion this year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, we believe that organically, we'll be above -- at least, with our -- what's baked into the forecast and the guidance we just gave you, we would expect to be slightly over $1 billion in Logix for the fiscal year. So we're still there on an organic basis, and we're growing that business at the rates, and in some of the markets, where we can get information, we believe we're outperforming the underlying markets. And that certainly is something that we pay very close attention to. As you know, we've introduced a number of new products this year. It's still very early in those introductions, but we're very pleased with the expansion of the platform and certainly look for that to be a help not just in the fourth quarter, but certainly as we go into fiscal '13. So that's part of the investments I talked about earlier that are important that we continue to make.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And Keith, sorry, just to follow that, you're not seeing a major competitor or accelerated competitive response anymore to Logix? There's not -- you're not seeing anything picking up on competition?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, I think the competitive environment stays pretty much the same. And we think with the ongoing investments that we expect to continue to stay ahead of any of our competitors. And just to remind you, when I talk about the 3% this year, we had greater than 30% Logix growth in Q3 of last year. So it was a tough comp, but 3% is still not what we expected, quite frankly, or what we plan for, even in a tough comp environment. But it was very, very difficult on a quarter-over-quarter basis.","Operator","Next question comes from Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, Keith, could you just speak -- you mentioned the book-to-bill in the Solutions was 1. I'm curious was -- how were the bookings on the Process side of Solutions? Is Process a big piece of Solutions, and is the momentum there continuing?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, we don't have a specific breakdown in the book-to-bill on Process versus others. But we certainly, in general, see a continued growth in the process applications and areas that we work in. So we see it's a growth across the regions. And as I just said, the process continues to grow above the company average. And we're not seeing anything in the front log or the order trends that would indicate that, that process will not continue to be the higher rate of growth piece of our Solutions business.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question. When we look at the sequential growth from Q2 to Q3, and you've addressed this, that things slowed down or maybe didn't quite hit the expectations for re-accelerating in some markets. On the A&S side, it would seem that the below-norm seasonal growth would be a function of Brazil, as you mentioned, and also Europe OEMs or machine builders. On the CP&S side, the below-seasonal growth, is that largely a function of Solutions in China? Is that where we're seeing the pushouts of deferrals?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think 2 -- I think, yes. And in addition to that, Solutions would be in Latin America. So it would be Latin America and emerging Asia, in particular, China, would be the 2 largest areas that would drive your Q2 to Q3 comment.","Operator","The next question comes from Mr. Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Keith, maybe just on the 7% organic growth in the quarter, can you give us a little flavor on the -- how that broke down by verticals, which were above and below? And then thinking into some slowing in the 4Q, any particular ones you think will be the drivers of the slowdown?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. In the quarter, the best-performing verticals, so best-performing would mean above Rockwell Automation average, would be automotive, oil and gas, metals and mining. If you look at the ones that would be about at our average, the verticals would be tire, life sciences. And if you look at the one that probably grew below the Rockwell average, it would have been the consumer industries on a global basis. As far as the outlook, we would expect transportation, in particular, auto, to continue to be a healthy grower. And we like the front log that we see in transportation and, particularly, automotive. And we see it across many regions with the exception of EMEA. The heavy industries there, we would expect to see some performance flattening. We think oil and gas will maintain the strength that it has. But as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing some forward sentiment in metals and mining that appears to be more cautious now than it was previously, although we don't see that as a big impact in Q4. And then the consumer is basically flat. We think the spending there is really focused in emerging markets and then process optimization in some of the mature markets. So that's a little bit of a feel for the forward-looking picture on our verticals.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then on China, I mean, it continued to actually get, I guess, a little better, just not as much as you thought. In terms of thinking about what fell a little short, any particular areas there? And in your comment that you still expect it to improve, just not in your fiscal fourth quarter, any evidence of -- that in terms of your front log or things that you have visibility into that? Or is it just more of a macro comment on China stimulus?","Keith D. Nosbusch","It's a macro comment on China, not just the stimulus, but also on the work that they're doing to ease interest rates for lending. So we expect the liquidity situation to get better as well as the stimulus. And so I think as far where were the areas that we saw the softness, well, I think for the quarter, it was really in a couple of activities. And the most important was probably the stimulus did not ramp up or did not get executed as fast as we thought, particularly in some of the municipal projects, which tend to be the area they go to quickly to drive investment and improve spending. And the other area was simply the liquidity issue. Many small-, mid-sized customers, distributors, system integrators, it was tough for them to get money. And I think that is what caused some of the project delays that we referred to that impacted us in China. So it was the small- and mid-sized companies and then projects and a little bit associated with a slow implementation of the stimulus that got announced earlier in the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Winnie Clark, UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So on the purchases. You repurchased 1.6 million shares in the quarter. I think that puts you a little bit under 2 million for the year, or actually, I think, potentially a little bit over. You had previously indicated you expect to repurchase roughly 3 million for the year. What -- how should we think about the pace of repurchases going forward? Is that still kind of your guidance, or is there a potential to pick up the purchases in that fourth quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think the easiest answer is yes. I mean, we're about, I think through the end of June, we're about 2.3 million shares repurchased. And I'd say we're on track to hit the 3 million that we talked about last quarter.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, so -- but yet you don't think that you'll be above that 3 million,  that's probably just on track?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, we never in the quarter talk about what we might repurchase in the quarter.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then if we think about being in the slower-growth economy, how should we think about the growth potential of the automation market and then for Rockwell, specifically, in that kind of environment?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, we certainly believe that automation outgrows the underlying market. And we don't believe that's any different in a slowing economy. Certainly, we believe there's more emphasis on productivity and cost reduction in a slowing economy than there, obviously, is in capacity expansion. And so we've been very successful in both the U.S. and Western Europe, 2 mature markets that require ongoing cost reductions, ongoing productivity improvements as well as ongoing regulatory compliance. So we think safety, we think compliance, we think cost reduction and productivity plays very well in a slowing economy. And certainly, we think emerging markets is where we will, again, see ongoing spending for capacity expansion and new investments and, I should say, new capacity, simply because of the ongoing expansion of the economy, as well as the growing middle-class and disposable income. And certainly, if you look at historical, the '06 to '08 period, we still grew at an average of 7.5%. So we -- I think we believe we can outgrow the market. And if it's a slower-growth environment, we still expect to be able to grow at a faster pace. And, quite candidly, that's, I think, one of the beauties of the automation market. It's an area and an industry that companies need what we do not just in good times, but in bad times as well. So we think we're very well positioned with the portfolio of our products solutions and services to be able to support customers across a business cycle.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay.

Architecture & Software delivered its six straight quarter of at least 5% organic growth, our investments there are paying off. Logic sales were up 7% in the quarter, so back to more normal expected relationship. The Logic sales exceeding the segment average and we continued to see traction with our mid-range portfolio. It\u2019s not on the chart, but our process business grew 4% in the quarter.","Latin America was a standout region with 18% growth. Brazil and Mexico continued to grow about 10% and we saw even higher rates of growth in selected other countries in the region. Our team there is executing very well and I congratulate them on an outstanding quarter. We expect Latin America to be our highest growth region this year and they are off to a great start. Ted will provide additional color on the other region\u2019s performance.","Operation margin EPS growth and free cash flow were all very strong in the quarter, so all in all that was a very good start to the fiscal year.","Let\u2019s move on to the macro environment. One of the big changes since I talk in November is a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a broad basket of currencies. At current rates, we are facing a significantly larger sales headwind then we originally expected. Ted will provide more detail regarding currency impacts in his remarks.","As it relates to underlying market condition with the exception of oil and gas, things haven\u2019t changed much at all. The U.S. continuously demonstrating strength, we are watching EMEA closely as we deal with geopolitical and economic challenges, but we aren\u2019t expecting any significant change in market conditions there.","In Asia, things are looking better in India and a bit softer in China. Despite lower commodity prices, we expect to see continue growth in Latin American markets. Regarding vertical markets, generally we\u2019re seeing continued healthy investment in consumer verticals and transportation. In heavy industries, we\u2019re expecting mix market conditions for relative stability overall, however there is obviously a good deal of noise related to oil and gas.","Just like other suppliers, the oil and gas industry, we are trying to understand the near-term and longer term implications of the rapid decline in the price of oil. We did not see any negative impact to our business in Q1 and our front log [ph] in oil and gas is stable. Most of our oil and gas customers had not yet declared their capital spending plans for calendar 2015, a lot of that will become public in the next several weeks. But at this point, here is out view.","There will be a negative impact on CapEx investment due to the lower price of oil, but the timing of spending cuts is harder to predict. We think oil and gas customers are likely to complete large projects already underway and proceed with those they consider strategic. Generally this industry takes a longer-term view of their CapEx investments. Any negative impact on spending will likely be more significant in exploration especially for unconventional sources.","We expect to see some shift in spending from large projects in exploration to smaller productivity improvement projects in production similar to what we\u2019ve experienced in the mining industry over the past couple of years.","Lastly, we think midstream and downstream investments are likely to be sustained. Taking all of this into consideration, we see modest risk to our previous sales outlook for fiscal \u201915 related to lower oil prices.","With all of that said, let\u2019s move on to our updated outlook for fiscal \u201915. Our most GDP and industrial product forecast continue to call for stable growth in 2015. We are incorporating the more significant headwind from a stronger dollar and the anticipated impact of lower oil prices into our revised outlook. For full year sales, we\u2019re increasing the currency headwind by almost three points and lowering the top end of our organic growth guidance of 6.5% to 5.5% while these results in a preferred change to the top line, the midpoint for EPS guidance in only $0.10 lower.","We now expect fiscal 2015 reported sales of about $6.6 billion with organic growth in the range of 2.5% to 5.5% and adjusted EPS of $6.50 to $6.80. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","So to wrap up, Q1 was a very good start to the year, even though I\u2019ve talked a lot about oil and gas here, it is only 12% of sales. In fact, the oil prices remain low, we expect to see some benefit in our other verticals especially consumer, which is sweet spot for Rockwell Automation. We\u2019ve remained excited about the opportunities we see in consumer and automotive in process with OEMs and to the connected enterprise. We continue to invest in all of these areas.","Our revenue diversification works and we\u2019re executing very well across the globe. I want to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their dedication in expertise and continually expanding the value we provide to our customers and shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted?","Ted Crandall","Thanks, Keith and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with page four, first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.574 billion, 1.1% lower than Q1 last year. Organic sales growth as Keith mentioned was 2.1%, a current translation reduced sales in the quarter by 3.4 points. Segment operating margin was very strong at 22%, up 140 basis points from Q1 last year, despite the small sales decline.","The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher organic sales, favorable mix and a strong productivity quarter, partially offset by a modest increase in spending.","General corporate net expense was $23 million in Q1, up about $1 million compared to a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.64, up $0.17 or 12% compared to the first quarter of last year.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 26% compared to 27.8% in Q1 last year. The 26% adjust effective rate in Q1 reflects the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for calendar year 2014.","Free cash flow for Q1 was $233 million, a very good result for the first quarter and strong start for the year. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 103% in Q1. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 30.1%. There were couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $136.9 million that\u2019s down about 2.5% compared to last year. And during the first quarter, we\u2019ve repurchased 1.55 million shares at a cost of about $167 million. At the end of the quarter, we had 884 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","The next two slides presents the sales and operating margin performance of each segment, I\u2019ll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page five. On the left side of this chart, you can see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $708 million in Q1 an increase of 1.7% compared to Q1 last year. Organic growth was 5.1%. Moving to the right side of the chart, on 5.1% organic growth A&S margins were 31.3% up 90 basis points compared to Q1 last year. With the improved margin primarily due to the higher organic sales and a good productivity quarter.","Now turning to page six, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales were down 3.3% year-over-year and essentially flat year-over-year on an organic basis. Organic growth for product sales in the segment was a solid 3.3%. Solutions and services sales were down 2.8% organically. That was actually a bit better than we expected given the low starting backlog.","The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13 that\u2019s pretty healthy and starts to rebuild the backlog that we need to drive growth in the balance of this year in this part of our business.","CP&S delivered very good operating margin in Q1 at 14.5%, up 150 basis points compared to last year, despite the decline in reported sales. The earnings conversion on the negative currency impact was modest in this segment. Mix was somewhat favorable. Project margins were better in the solutions and services businesses and that was particularly strong productivity quarter.","Page seven, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter. The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven largely by Latin America with Canada and Asia Pacific also contributing. The U.S. was flat year-over-year in Q1 with 3% growth than the product businesses and a 4% decline in the solutions and services businesses. The decline in solutions and services was expected and consistent with our comments last year regarding a low beginning backlog. The underlying market in the U.S. remains very healthy and that was reflected an orders growth in the U.S. in the mid-single digits.","Canada saw 8% growth that was partly about project timing and an easy comparison in the last year. But with the exception of the Oil Sands, we\u2019re seeing some pickup in most other markets in Canada.","EMEA was down 1% organically, it was somewhat unusual quarter for the region in that sales and Western Europe were actually up 1.6%. However that was more than offset by declines in emerging countries particularly South Africa and to a lesser extent Turkey and Russia.","Asia Pacific was up 2.9%, growth was pretty broad based across the region with the exception of China which was down 2%. I would attribute the decline in China more to project timing than any change in underlying market conditions. China orders in the quarter were up mid-single digit.","India organic growth in Q1 was 9%, so we continue to see improvement in that market. Keith already talked about Latin America, so I\u2019ll close out this slide, I\u2019ll just add that overall for emerging markets, organic growth was 4.4% and that obviously led by Latin America.","And that takes us to the fiscal year \u201915 guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we\u2019re revising our full year guidance. We\u2019re reducing full year sales guidance primarily to reflect a much more significant headwind from currency and to a lesser step, less optimism about the high end of the sales range. We\u2019re dropping the high end of the sales range primarily due to the very significant decline in oil prices, but also because we\u2019re continuing to see forecasts for IT and GDP be revised downward in most regions although the forecast still call for growth in 2015 that\u2019s similar to 2014.","Our previous guidance call for reported sales of approximately 6.8 billion at the midpoint, in the original guidance, we expected currency to reduce sales by 1.8 points and we expect organic growth of 2.5% to 6.5%. Now for the full year, because the dollar is continued to appreciate against the broad basket of currencies, we expect currency to reduce sales by 4.5 points. That difference in currency impact from previous to current guidance results in a reduction and reported sales for the full year of about $180 million.","We\u2019re also reducing the high end of organic growth from 6.5% to 5.5%. We\u2019re maintaining the low end of organic growth to 2.5% that will drop organic growth at the midpoint by 1.5 point.","We\u2019re revising EPS guidance from the previous 655 to 695 to a new range of $6.50 to $6.80. From the old to the new midpoint, EPS will be down by $0.10, that\u2019s a very modest EPS decline on a roughly $200 million sales decline coupling the currency impact and the organic sales change.","In part based on our performance in Q1, we now expect slightly higher operating margins for the full year about 20 basis points, but still about 21%. We\u2019re projecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.5%, half a point lower than previous guidance and largely due to the R&D tax credit. We didn\u2019t plan on the extension of the R&D credit in the original guidance.","Those factors allow us to absorb a pretty large drop in the sales guidance with a relatively small impact on EPS. We continue to expect converted by 100% of net come to free cash flow and that\u2019s couple of items not shown here, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $80 million for the full year and we continue to expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 136 million for the full year.","The last slide is a walk for adjusted EPS from the previous to the revise guidance midpoint. Starting on the last slide, the previous guidance for adjusted EPS midpoint was $6.75. The big change as you can see here is currency compared to prior guidance with the additional top line translation headwind of a 180 million. All in, we expect a related earnings impact to reduce adjusted EPS by about $0.25.","A little higher operating market is more than offsetting the impact of a half point lower organic sales growth at the new midpoint and the net effect adds about $0.09 to quarter. Lower tax rate and share counts add an additional $0.06 compared to prior guidance that gets us to the new midpoint of $6.65.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Rondi to begin Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great, that said, before we start the Q&A, just look at the list, we have quite few callers and that few I know we\u2019re not going to be able to get everyone, but I guess in the spirit of trying to get to as many as possible if you can you know letting yourself to a question and one follow-up that would be great. We appreciate your cooperating on that and so let\u2019s take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, John.","John G. Inch","Good morning. We start with Canada, I know it\u2019s relatively higher proportionate exposure for Rockwell. How much of the $0.25, Ted, is Canadian dollar? Let\u2019s start there.","Ted Crandall","I would say probably about a quarter of it.","John G. Inch","Okay.","Ted Crandall","A large as you would expect the largest impact we have from currency is from the euro and depending on whether you talk about the full year or the quarter of the balance of the year, the euro accounts generally for more than half of the impact.","John G. Inch","You know greater called out transaction exposure in Canada, do you have that in other words, are you selling Canadian customers U.S. made product that\u2019s going to create for perspective margin headwinds, just again trying to be somewhat proactive in the through process?","Keith Nosbusch","Well it cuts both legs and then we do have transaction exposure in Canada because we manufacture around the globe and selling to Canada, but we also manufacture in Canada and export to the rest of the world. So we\u2019ve got some natural hedge, we do have some transaction exposure and we hedge that.","John G. Inch","Okay, the other question I had was just automotive powertrain, I know you guys are making a lot of head growth into that arena, what point do you think we might actually, maybe this question for Keith, started actually realize some sales from the powertrain, start for orders you\u2019d be talking about because right now the popular view is your auto business is peaked but in theory you\u2019ve got two - you know you got another 50% of the market that you just beginning to tab?","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, John, I would say we\u2019ve had limited success only because - at this point only because these are projects that are lawn in the planning stage and we just started a little over a year ago in the - I\u2019ll say in the pursuit. So we\u2019re seeing that the backlog on powertain opportunities increase, we don\u2019t have a lot of booked orders at this point in time. I would say that we should see an increase as we go through this year with a stronger outlook in the next three - two to three years with respect to strictly the powertrain segment of automotive.","John G. Inch","Just last, you guys are sitting on the most over capitalized balance sheet maybe next to ITT, I realize you are buying incrementally more shares but what are your thoughts toward somehow stepping mess up in some manner through other financial leverage or some other actions to return more cash to shareholders? Thank you.","Ted Crandall","But John, we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this in the last couple of years and as part of that talked about cash balances and where they are. I think we\u2019ve been very consistent in our cash deployment philosophy or expectation is that we will continue to exhaust free cash flow each after organic growth funding and acquisitions and return the balance to shareholders. Last year, you know we did a little bit more than that because of the strong cash flow year. This year we\u2019ve got north to start that is in pace of brought back you know given that we will - it\u2019s possible that we won that spending a little more than that this year. But I don\u2019t think we are fundamentally changed our approach.","John G. Inch","Got it, thank you.","Ted Crandall","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you, John. We have another question for you. This one is from the line Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead Scott.","Scott R. Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Scott.","Scott R. Davis","Can you help us understand, I mean I am picturing a scenario where it seems is calls other people are going to say that you are not being conservative in oil and the impact. I mean, can you give us a sense of what you\u2019ve learned in mining and what the parallels are here as far as how fast things can ramp down and how you mentioned in your prepared remarks, how project can gravitate. But help us understand and maybe a first point to start is, give us a sense of where mining when peak the trough for you guys and where you see some parallels in oil?","Keith Nosbusch","Well I think the parallels are more along the lines of that new investments in expansion is the area that gets impacted first and obviously they were rising commodity prices when there were a lot of process going on and the commodities pricing was going up mainly driven by the China growth. And I think that we\u2019ve seen in mining and what we think is in parallel is the major projects that were going on were not stopped, those continued to move through to conclusion. And as those were moving through what we saw was a decline in new investments in new capacity and a switch of that to more including productivity and taking cost out of their existing operations. And they were doing that obviously because the prices were going as opposed to prices going up and you can sell everything you can mine.","And so I would say those were the learnings and I think the other thing that we feel is similar is that both of these industries take a long term view of their investments, a mine is plan to run generally for decades and oil depending upon the magnitude the field is also for decades. So it\u2019s not a decision they take are literally or capriciously based upon a short term swing in the price of oil - in the price of whatever the commodity is. In this case, obviously there has been a dramatic drop in about six months.","So I think the important thing in here is I won\u2019t say we\u2019re not being aggressive in our beliefs here. I don\u2019t think that final card has been placed to understand what\u2019s going on in the market yet. You know very few companies have come out with their CapEx guidance. I think we\u2019ve seen one of the major oil company so far. I think we\u2019ve seen some oil services company respond, but we need to at least wait until we get a little more insight before we\u2019re making calls in this industry and I just think it\u2019s still too early to say anything more than we have at this point in time. So we\u2019re obviously monitoring it. But to your point, in mining what we say was a 15% decline over two years, so that gives you a little bit of a scale of what is possibly ahead of us in oil, but we just feel at this point, it\u2019s too early to make that call given that CapEx budgets haven\u2019t been outlined and secondly it takes time, it takes time for these decisions to ripple through organization, they don\u2019t happen in the same day, the same week, the same month that the decisions are made. So they have to prioritize, they have to recalibrate, they have to reevaluate and then come up with the new list and how that impacts us, we\u2019ll not be knowing for a meaningful down the road.","So we\u2019re trying to keep it write down the middle of the fair way here and call it by what we\u2019re seeing today and to your point, we making it a little bit to experiences that we\u2019ve had in and perhaps a similar industry of mining.","Scott R. Davis","And I think people on this call it down 15 of two years of victory, but so I hope that happens, but anyway I just wanted to ask a quick follow-up on currency in competition. You know you guys have done really well with the machine builders in Europe for probably ten years, but this is a different level of yen for the Japanese competitors and clearly depend level for euro. But have things change to the point where you have such a fantastic relationship with the OE builders that somebody coming in at 5% or 10% lower price is not enough to get on the switch or is it still somewhat of aggressive, you know a more commoditize product?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a more commoditize product, I certainly don\u2019t feel that\u2019s the core of our business quite frankly. But that the issue is more around machine cycles than it is around price. With OEMs, the important thing and what we\u2019ve been working on over the last decade is how do we get in the design cycles and how do we validate our differentiation that enables them to get better machine performance utilizing our technology. And at the end of the day, it\u2019s that combination that is more important than strictly a short term price based upon currency fluctuations which obviously moving both directions at some point in time.","So I think it\u2019s about creating that value and creating that differentiation to enable us to build the loyalty and the confidence that we are the best solution for them and not have to be 5% to 10% price up - on upfront cost advantage because it really is all about the total lifecycle cost for the end users and that\u2019s where the bigger emphasis is placed.","Ted Crandall","Scott, I think that the price that was talked about previously is you know historically we have not seen a lot of changes in price dynamics and price behavior associated with currency changes and we\u2019ve had a lot of discussion about that over the last couple of years as it relates to the yen. You know our global supply chain isn\u2019t perfectly balanced but it\u2019s certainly not like we build everything that we manufacture in the United States. And most of our major competitors have a similarly global supply chain. And so I think that\u2019s partly the reason that you don\u2019t see big changes in pricing behaviors consequence of the currency changes.","Scott R. Davis","It\u2019s very helpful. Good luck guys, best of luck this year.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you, Scott. We have another question for you. This comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead Steve.","Stephen Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Steve.","Stephen Tusa","So can I just ask you what do you assuming now for oil and gas growth this year?","Ted Crandall","Yeah, so I mean maybe the easiest thing is to think about it as, we\u2019re expecting no growth at midpoint.","Stephen Tusa","Okay, no growth in oil and gas at the midpoint, okay. And within that I guess you know what do you guys looking for over the next couple of weeks as far as what should we be watching and looking for when it comes to these CapEx budget, I mean is there specific sliver at the market that you guys are more focused on, you said you\u2019re looking for another turn of the cards, just curious just to you know maybe a little more detail on and maybe were you most worried or where you think you have the best change of stability and what the cap for over the next month or so.","Keith Nosbusch","Sure, first half, it\u2019s just the magnitude of their CapEx reductions. I think that\u2019s the first test period. And then it goes back to okay, so how does that - how does that really play out against the different applications and the different segments of the market. And certainly, we\u2019re more exposed to upstream and so that would be our greatest concern. If a lion share of that reduction was targeted in the upstream, we certainly think there is opportunities to continue to improve the productivity of well, so we believe that as they move to OpEx in upstream that is beneficial for us and would be helpful as an offset to the new well drilling and then the split between unconventional and conventional spending and how they are seeing the impact of the lower prices and the stock of oil.","Stephen Tusa","Got it and so clearly the solution to book-to-bill, you are saying you are seeing really any unusually behavior from your customers?","Ted Crandall","That would fair, we haven\u2019t seen any at this point.","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, I think that was the Q1 takeaway, we have no change.","Ted Crandall","And Steve to your question about then the announcement will come up in the next couple of weeks, we\u2019re key started, I think what we get a better picture for is the magnitude of expected cuts. I suspect what was still be a little bit uncertain is the timing of that and all that based on experiences, it\u2019s going to take a little longer to implement those cuts then some others might be expecting.","Stephen Tusa","And will this be like the big guys or you know like the Exxon to the world or is it mostly you know is it really broad based.","Keith Nosbusch","It\u2019s yes, it\u2019s very broad based because, today our business is you know with majors but also with the NOCs and also with the Tier-2s given the magnitude of unconventional, a lot of that has been driven by Tier-2s. So it really is across all the spectrum of the industry which as you have known has grown pretty dramatically, so with the advent of unconventional. So we would look at it in each one of those segments and then look at our exposure into those segments and our front lot against those segments and then have a better feel. And obviously when I am taking upstream, we\u2019re move heavily into production then we are into exploration. So that\u2019s the other split.","And we think the safest area quite frankly is downstream where all of this low cost oil and gas is going to flow into the chemicals and petrochemicals market and while that at this point is a smaller segment of our total sales. It\u2019s an area that we feel we\u2019ll be state the most stable for the longest period of time going forward. So we think that is where the opportunities can remain and can grow even if there is a reduction in the upstream segment. So it\u2019s a complex market that has many different variables and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to - we need to evaluate each one of those as we get more influence.","Stephen Tusa","One last question, any impact on that, your margins were very strong and the growth in emerging markets are strong and several years ago that was headwind. Any impact from you know, did the movements in foreign exchange on your margin because the margins are just absolutely blowout this quarter very strong when this expected with the growth in Latin America and Canada, so any impact from hedges or like that on the margins in the quarter?","Ted Crandall","I would say, I mean that you are saying any significant favorable impacting. Answer is no. Actually currency in the quarter probably converted a little bit more negatively than what we expect is average conversion.","Stephen Tusa","Great execution.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Thank you, Steve. We have another question for you. This comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. Keith, just on the comments that oil and gas being 12%, is that all away through the entire complex down through petrochemicals or is there you know you kind of stopping at on refining when you say that. Can you just put fine point on kind of whole complex?","Keith Nosbusch","Absolutely, my comment would be, mainly the 12% is oil and gas, we would put chemical at about 4% about sales.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","And that would include petrochemical.","Jeffrey Sprague","Right, what do you think you know kind of describes the serves that you saw in the quarter on kind of the low starting backlogs and you know is there some kind of budget flush or something else going on that this seems the - you know that in fact happens?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, I don\u2019t think there was any budge flush quite frankly that I think some of it was project timing. I think as always we get the - you know you get the quarterly what gets in and what gets pushed out. And I think what we did see and what we did talk about at the end of our Q4 was there were a lot of push outs and delays in the solutions business and we definitely saw a return to a much more normal end of the year. And that probably more than the budge flush though process is what turned it a little more positive for us and - in that category.","Jeffrey Sprague","And on the outlook for oil and gas, there is kind of a wait really a little bit more clarity of what the customers are actually going to do. Is there you know kind of prevented or predictive draw out in distribution that starting to happen or that\u2019s not even underway either?","Keith Nosbusch","No, we\u2019ve seen - there has been no draw down. Our outgoing flow is as you know we basically match our distributors shipments with our deliberates and we\u2019re not seeing any deviation at this point in time in anticipation of any future activities.","Jeffrey Sprague","And this another quick one. I think last time you know I mean is up 18 right with Brazil and Mexico of 10, I would imagine those are 75% or 80% of lifetime. So how do you get up, I mean what was up 100% or some crazy number in Latin America?","Keith Nosbusch","Well the two of those are generally about two thirds, so a little less than what you\u2019re talking about. But if you remember probably one of the biggest that the biggest differences was Argentina which a year ago was pretty much shutdown for us anyways and we\u2019re now back to a more I\u2019d say stable environment that could change at any time. But in our entire first quarter that was probably were the biggest doubt that came.","And then we also had some Central American activities that were stronger and the Andean Regions are Chili was another benefit and that\u2019s a little bit back an earlier commentary around mining, mining was very weak in Chili last year and we\u2019re starting to see some of the operation OpEx spending that\u2019s kicking in as opposed to pure CapEx. So I would put it into those two to three countries.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thank you for that color, I appreciate it.","Keith Nosbusch","You are welcome Jeff.","Operator","Thank you for your question, Jeff. We have another for you. It\u2019s coming from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst.","Good morning, guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Shawn.","Unidentified Analyst.","Hey, Keith maybe can you dig in a little bit more in terms of these you know the pickup in investment you are seeing in the consumer industries and you know are these capacity investments are the new product related or technology migrations, I mean you know it seems like you are probably seeing a pickup there the cycle and just maybe a little more color on what types of things you are seeing?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, I think with the consumer industries, it\u2019s always dependent upon the regions that we\u2019re seeing it. And basically you can think of everything in emerging market is new investment particularly as far as developing, I\u2019ll call it more sophisticated manufacturing processes in particular with domestic in suppliers. Take China as the primary example, you all know that they\u2019ve had a food scares, so that they are going to much more rigger in their internal processes and that requires automation investments. We also know that they are continuing to expand capacity in their food sector as the middleclass continues to grow which is the other driven in the immerging markets and that\u2019s not just China that would be Latin America, Mexico as well.","So I would put a lot of it into that space in immerging. In the mature economies I think the majority of it is continued drive for cost reduction and productivity and out of that they also get some capacity expansion. But generally speaking, it\u2019s more along the lines to reduce cost and to be able to continue to drive higher levels of productivity. And really as always in the mature markets, packaging styles change and whether it\u2019s the materials used or how they do printing on them or the size of the package, it\u2019s a little bit like the automotive industry where you have model change years even though you don\u2019t have capital spending - you don\u2019t have a lot of increase in new card sales, they just have to modernize their portfolio. And in consumer industry, it\u2019s a lot of times around the packaging that is very similar to the styling of cards. And so they have to buy new packaging lines, take advantage of new technology, so I would say that\u2019s what we see more in the matured markets.","Unidentified Analyst.","Okay, great, that\u2019s really helpful. And then Ted, maybe you know free cash flow was up around I think 30% year-over-year and the buyback was up about 50, I mean any reason you know either of those were elevated in the quarter and why they would moderate from what happened in 1Q?","Ted Crandall","Yeah, I mean on the cash flow, I\u2019d say quarter-to-quarter, there are a lot timing issues just about you know things like payables and receivable cutoff dates and also timing of tax payment. So I think we\u2019re off to a good start but we\u2019re not really changing forecast for cash flow at this point.","On the repurchases side, you know we\u2019re facing a significant drop in the price in October from the time previous to that and under a 10b5-1 plan; we bought very aggressively with the drop in price. As the drop in price continue to end at November and December, we continue to buy what I would call above average rate and so I think that explains that the first quarter repurchases.","Unidentified Analyst.","Okay, great, thanks a lot guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. This comes from Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question you know you were talking about expanding capacity of logics you know adding sales people in the Gulf region, what are these capacity expansion plans are right now given decline market dynamic?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we continue to see a - I am assuming when you are talking about oil and gas in the Middle East.","Andrew Obin","Yeah.","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, we\u2019ll continue to see a project activity there. The Middle East is probably got the lowest cost conventional oil and I think you\u2019ve also seen most of those countries say they are going to keep pumping because of that. So we\u2019re not seeing any change, we also continue to see the activities going on with respect to metals in the Middle East region. So I would at this point in that region, we\u2019re not sensing any change in their current plans.","Andrew Obin","I think I was also refurnishing the Gulf of Mexico as well because you guys are pretty optimist think about the dealt out there?","Keith Nosbusch","I am sorry, I misunderstood the gulf. Okay.","Andrew Obin","Hey I am Russian, it\u2019s not my first language.","Keith Nosbusch","That\u2019s fair enough, but it might my ears too. With the Gulf, we have not seen at this point any change in the activities there. A lot the Gulf is - we\u2019re not a lot but a significant portion of the Gulf is Mexico production, it\u2019s obviously very important to their economy. And I think we\u2019ll see a bunch of that continue as the - as we see that some of the majors determine what\u2019s going to happen with their CapEx. I think the question in the Gulf is, some of the modernization and some of our comments about the modernization of those wells and the ongoing expansion could be at risk going forward.","And really most of our previous comments on the Gulf were what would happen along the Gulf of the U.S. We were very - not very, we were more positive about the downstream activities and the impact on the Gulf of Mexico, U.S. region which was really about the chemical and petrochemical industry and we still feel bullish about that. We think those investments will continue to go forward, they are building the ethylene crackers, they are building the new ammonia and other chemical plants. And we see that is continuing basically because of the ongoing cost their input cost if anything have gotten better over the last six months than they were previously.","So I now remember the questions around the Gulf and it was really the Gulf region of the U.S and we invigoration of the chemical, petrochemical industry in the Texas, Louisiana area and we still see that as a growth opportunity for Rockwell Automation.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question. You know I think the big day among our clients is what happens to North American energy production in 2017. When you talk to your customers the initial conversation, what do you think the prevailing view, do you think the low energy price kills the growth in North American production beyond 2016 or do you think the view is that somehow technology and engineering prevails in North America continues to grow its production?","Keith Nosbusch","I would say in 2017, is a long time out for predictions with respect to the energy market. But I think the one thing that has probably proving now overtime is technology works and the U.S. is probably the most innovative technology country when it comes to oil and gas. So I would never count that dimension out. But I just can\u2019t forecast two years out.","Ted Crandall","I also think - I also think at least at this point most of our customers and don\u2019t think this is a prediction for Rockwell but if it goes to our customers, don\u2019t expect oil price is to say 50 bucks a gallon or 50 bucks a barrel, certainly for two years.","Andrew Obin","I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Keith Nosbusch","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you, Andrew. We have another question for you. This comes from Nigel Coe at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Thanks guys, good morning. Fed and then Keith, you brought some pretty good 1Q color, I hope - I think the 1Q color was more in line because of the softer book-to-bill during 4Q. But I am wondering, anything standard for 2Q which is better minded, Ted?","Ted Crandall","Maybe the only think I would say about the second quarter is you know it\u2019s very normal for us to see a sequential sales and EPS decline when we move from Q1 to Q2. And this Q1 we have told you we thought was a particularly strong earnings quarter.","Nigel Coe","Okay, that\u2019s - but you\u2019d expect organic to accelerate from 1Q levels?","Ted Crandall","What we certainly in the balance of the year, we\u2019re expecting higher rates of organic growth in the remaining nine months that in Q1.","Nigel Coe","Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. And then follow-on question, you know I think the relative mining is a good one and you mentioned Keith that mining was down you know picking up for the two years and I am wondering you know over that period, did the pricing holdup and then that did you margins in mining holdup as well?","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, so I think we did not see any meaningful change in margins in the mining industry over those years. I think the projects become more competitive. But in general, that\u2019s why we have to continue to drive productivity.","Ted Crandall","I think Nigel we even think that happens is as you might expect. As we start to see the larger project going away which is the larger projects generally tend to be lower margin and more smaller productivity related projects coming in and moreover activity. In some respects, we actually see a little bit of margin benefit.","Nigel Coe","Okay and that\u2019s we are seeing right now in the - you mentioned actually that\u2019s more OpEx driven?","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, that is correct.","Nigel Coe","Okay and then just the final one, we think sometime think of Latin and Canada as resources markets, currently you are seeing down there, is that primarily within oil and gas in resources, so is it broader than that?","Ted Crandall","I say much broader, I mean in Canada right now, we\u2019re seeing significant weakness as you would expect and Alberta with the oil sands, we\u2019re seeing some improvement in other markets in Canada, consumer, automotive, primarily in the Eastern part of the country and Latin America, you know our growth in the quarter and I\u2019d say for last couple of years has been pretty broad based especially in Mexico and Brazil. In Mexico, we\u2019re seeing great growth consumer and transportation. In Brazil, you know transportation not as great, the consumer has been pretty good in additions of the resource based industries.","Nigel Coe","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you for your question. And we have another question for you. This comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead, Steven.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, good morning. Could you maybe talk a little bit about lot of your peers are attacking their cost structures right now with significant restructuring and they are currently putting up mid-single digit organic growth, they see a global environment that not to similar to what you just described in terms of those international challenges anyway. But maybe just help us think through a little bit about how you are thinking about sensitivities and reaction time right now given the uncertainty at least that\u2019s not weakness outside the U.S. and Argentina and Canada?","Ted Crandall","Yeah, so Steve, this is Ted. You know last year, especially with what we\u2019re seeing is the slowdown in our solutions and services businesses, we started the kind of adjust the cost structure in those businesses and we took some restructuring action in the second of the year and some charges in the fourth quarter to facilitate that. And there just one other reason we\u2019re driving the levels of productivity that you saw in the first quarter. So we think we got a little bit ahead of that with the outlook we have for the balance of this, we don\u2019t think we require any additional large restructuring actions, but obviously we\u2019ll continue to monitor that and conditions to material way, we\u2019ll make the appropriate adjustments to our cost structure.","Steven Winoker","Ted on that, you know you talked a little bit about GDP in IPI forecasts weakening as well locally, maybe some sense on the sensitivity around that, so when you say you know much weakening from here, I mean how well do you think you are protected, is it just sort of you know miles deceleration from here that you could handle a flat or the absence of growth or have to be something much more than that?","Ted Crandall","Well, I mean obviously we got roughly 1.5% to 2% decline from our midpoint, that was reflected, you can see the earnings impact, that is reflected in that low end of the guidance range. And I would say impart, our assumption is that also reflect some cost actions we would take if we saw sales coming in at that level. You know things deteriorate beyond that would be in kind of new booking.","Steven Winoker","Okay, alright. And then just a second question on process and your progress interaction on that front. In this environment, are you seeing any further reduced opportunities in terms of your ability to penetrate new customers and new project opportunities, is that as your - is the environment changing and so we be thinking about growth here differently?","Keith Nosbusch","No, I think you know we saw 4% growth in process in Q1, we think that is a good growth in this current environment. It\u2019s obviously improved from where we were at the end of last year. And we do - we did lower process growth for the full year, so we were in the mid to high single digits, we are now in the mid-single digit. So we\u2019re little lower about one to two points lower. So our outlook is a little less or bullish and it was at the start of the year, but the majority of that is because of the anticipation of oil and gas as opposed to and inability to be able to continue to find opportunities for Rockwell in process.","We still see this as a good growth market for us and opportunity to expand our share. But given the oil and gas environment, we just started would be a little lower than what we started off in - at the start of the year with our November guidance. So process still importance to the good market and something that we can continue to grow and expand our footprint in.","Steven Winoker","Okay and just one last one on China, how do you see, I know you talked about the project issue this quarter but Keith, going forward, what is that sort of puts and takes in China that you think could be better at least for Rockwell?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, as I mentioned a little bit when we were talking about consumer, we certainly thing that\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to continue to take off as they continue to grow and they continue to demand more from their food supplier. So food, beverage, home and personal care, the consumer related markets were very bullish long term. On China, I think the difficulty in China is the metals markets and overcapacity, liquidity, the banking structures with the bank loans, so I think there was some financial - as far as the underlying markets other than overcapacity mainly in metals. We think consumer there is probably a little overcapacity in the total automotive market, but the multinationals and the JVs continue to growth their share, that\u2019s where we\u2019re obviously the strongest.","So we have a good outlook in consumer and transportation. We think oil and gas will continue to be good in China and so that scenario that we\u2019ve been investing more in. And also the infrastructure with the one area that the Chinese our government has continued a stimulus in has been in their metro and rail systems and that scenario where we have opportunities as well and have participated previously. So we think China even with the slowing growth rates will continue to be a market that we find opportunities in.","Steven Winoker","Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay, we have reached the end of our hour or little bit less than hour, so I think we\u2019re going to ramp it up here and I appreciate everyone\u2019s questions. I think we had very great thoughtful questions today on the call and I look forward to talking to most of you afterwards. So thanks for joining us and we\u2019ll talk soon.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open the lines up for questions.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Etzel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Etzel, please go ahead.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings release conference call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Patrick Goris, our CFO.","Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for reply for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So, with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page 3 in the slide deck. This was a very good quarter for us. Organic growth was up almost 6%, above expectations. This included 10% Logix growth and 8% Process growth.","From a vertical perspective, heavy industries performed well and grew above the company average in the quarter, led by growth in semiconductor, metals and chemicals. Consumer also grew above the company average, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Automotive was down about 10% in the quarter. Revenue associated with Information Solutions and Connected Services, which represent new value from The Connected Enterprise, once again, grew double-digits.","Commenting on regional performance, the U.S., our largest market, grew over 6% organically. We saw very good growth in all industries except transportation. EMEA was up about 1% in the quarter. Good growth in consumer was partially offset by transportation weakness and we have not yet seen a pick-up in heavy industries in this region. Asia grew about 6%. China's sales were up double-digits. Latin America sales were up 11% and growth was broad-based.","I'll make a few additional comments about our performance. I'm very pleased with our financial performance in the quarter. Segment operating margin expanded over 1 point to 22.5%. Margins improved in both of our operating segments. Adjusted EPS was up 23% and free cash flow was again very strong. Patrick will elaborate on our third quarter financial performance in his remarks.","Let's move on now to the macro environment and our outlook for full year fiscal 2018. Global industrial production and other production indicators remain strong. We are experiencing growth across the regions and industries that we serve. Customers are asking for the value that the Connected Enterprise brings to them as they continue to drive productivity in their operations.","Turning to guidance. Taking into consideration our year-to-date results of growing backlog and the macro outlook, we are raising our fiscal 2018 organic sales growth guidance to about 5.5% and continue to expect full year reported sales to be about $6.7 billion. We expect that heavy industries will continue to be the largest growth driver followed by consumer. The tough comps for auto get easier for the balance of the fiscal year. We are increasing our full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $8.10.","I'll turn it over to Patrick to provide more detail around our Q3 results and guidance in his remarks.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on slide 4, which provides our key financial information for the third quarter. As Blake mentioned, we had a good third quarter with reported sales up 6.2%. Organic growth of 5.7% was better than expected. Currency translation contributed 1.8 points of sales growth, a little less than expected given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","The fiscal 2017 Q4 divestiture reduced sales by 1.3 points. Segment operating margin was 22.5%, expanding 140 basis points compared to last year. A margin tailwind from organic growth and good operating performance was partially offset by higher investment spending. Through three quarters, segment operating margin is up 150 basis points year-over-year.","General corporate net expense of $28 million was up significantly compared to last year, mainly as a result of higher corporate development related expenses. Adjusted EPS of $2.16 was up 23% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase in adjusted EPS is mainly the result of higher sales and strong operating margin performance. A lower tax rate and lower share count also contributed to the year-over-year adjusted EPS increase.","Free cash flow performance was also very strong in the quarter at $321 million or 118% of adjusted income. A few additional items that are not shown on the slide. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 125.8 million, down 4.1 million from last year. We repurchased 2.5 million shares in the quarter at a cost of $430.8 million. Through June 30, we're on pace to get to our $1.5 billion full year target for share repurchase. At June 30, we had $504 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","And, finally, as we entered into the PTC agreements during the third quarter, our third quarter GAAP results include two adjustments related to our investment. One adjustment is a $7 million mark-to-market loss on investment based on PTC's closing share price on June 30, the last day of the quarter. On a quarterly basis, the mark-to-market adjustment we record depends on PTC's share price at the end of the quarter. For reference, at yesterday's closing price, we would have an unrealized gain of approximately $14 million.","The second adjustment is a temporary $70 million valuation adjustment, pending registration of the PTC securities as the accounting rules require us to discount the value of our investment in PTC until the shares are registered. We expect that the registration statement for the PTC securities will be filed by the end of the calendar year 2018, after which we will no longer carry this valuation adjustment. We are excluding both the mark-to-market and the temporary valuation adjustment from adjusted EPS.","Slide 5 provides the sales and margin performance overview of the Architecture & Software segment. This segment had about 9% year-over-year sales growth. Organic sales were better than expected, up 6.7%, and currency translation increased sales by 2%. For the quarter, segment margin expanded 210 basis points year-over-year to 30%. Margin tailwind from higher sales was partially offset by higher investment spending. The 10% growth in Logix also contributed to the very strong margin performance in this segment.","Moving on to slide 6, Control Products & Solutions, reported sales were up 4.1% for this segment. Organic sales growth was 4.9%. Currency translation contributed 1.6%, and the 2017 divestiture reduced sales by 2.4%. Operating margin for this segment increased 60 basis points compared to Q3 last year primarily due to higher sales, another quarter of good margin performance for this segment. Book-to-bill performance for our solutions and services businesses in this segment was a strong 1.12 in Q3.","The next slide, 7, provides an overview of our sales performance by region. Blake covered most of this slide in his remarks, so I will just point out that for Q3, emerging markets' organic growth was up about 8%.","Before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of comments about tariffs, specifically the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on certain goods imported into the U.S. from China, which came into effect on July 6. Some of our products and components are sourced from China and are impacted by these tariffs.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we estimate the net unfavorable impact of these tariffs will be less than $0.05 of adjusted EPS. We have been and are in the process of implementing mitigating actions to further reduce the impact of these tariffs. As to tariffs that have been proposed but not yet implemented, as you know, there remains a lot of uncertainty and we're analyzing potential implications to our business, including opportunities to mitigate their impacts if they are enacted.","This takes us to slide 8, guidance. As Blake mentioned, we are increasing our expected organic sales growth guidance to about 5.5%. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency translation to contribute less than 2% of growth. And the sale of the business in fiscal 2017 Q4 will, of course, remain about a 1 point headwind. All-in, we continue to project sales of about $6.7 billion.","We expect segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. This implies Q4 segment margin of a little below 21%. General corporate net expense is expected to be about $90 million for the full year, about $10 million to $15 million higher than our April guidance and mostly as a result of higher corporate development related costs.","We believe the full year adjusted effective tax rate will now be closer to 20%, 0.5 point lower than our April guidance and mainly as a result of the favorable outcome of a recent tax audit. In June, we raised our fiscal 2018 share repurchase target to $1.5 billion and we now expect fully diluted shares outstanding to be about 127 million for fiscal 2018.","We are increasing the adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.90 to $8.10. At the midpoint, this is a $0.15 increase compared to our April guidance. The increase is mainly a result of increased organic sales growth and margin performance, and to a lesser extent, a lower tax rate. Our guidance also reflects the modest headwind we expect as a result of tariffs that I covered earlier.","Finally, a slightly lower share count offsets higher net interest expense resulting from the PTC transaction. At the midpoint, this represents 18% EPS growth on 6% higher reported sales, primarily due to higher sales and strong operating performance. And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 105% of adjusted income. In summary, we had a good quarter and we expect fiscal 2018 to be another year of good financial performance for us.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick. This has been an exciting quarter. I'd like to make some additional comments about our progress in executing our strategy. Please refer to slides 9 and 10. With the world's largest company focused exclusively on making industrial companies and their people more productive, we are focused on delivering profitable, above-market revenue growth to drive long-term shareowner value.","Slide 9 is one you've seen before, which summarizes the three components of our growth strategy, which are share gains in our core platforms, double-digit growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services and a point or more of growth per year from acquisitions. We are delivering in each of these areas.","As mentioned earlier, we grew almost 6% this quarter, with strong performance in Logix and Process. Our performance in Process includes the contribution from MAVERICK Technologies, which we acquired a couple of years ago. This acquisition is performing well and is helping us expand in process industries.","Information Solutions and Connected Services grew double-digits in Q3 and these revenue streams together are approaching $300 million annually. Additionally, a strategic partnership with PTC creates the most comprehensive and flexible information software offering in the industry. This partnership enhances the differentiation of Rockwell's total portfolio and will accelerate revenue growth in Information Solutions and Connected Services. We're off to a great start with PTC, with technical and commercial teams from both organizations fully engaged.","Slide 10 summarizes our balanced approach to capital allocation. As mentioned on the prior slide, driving growth through acquisitions and strategic partnerships is a key part of our strategy. We are executing on well-defined priorities, which haven't changed. We have an active pipeline of opportunities in the key areas of information software, Connected Services, Process and regional share expansion.","At the same time, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareowners, through a combination of dividends and share repurchases, enabled by our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation. Twice in the last year, we increased our dividend by 10%. We've also increased our share repurchase target by $1 billion since the beginning of the fiscal year.","In total, we are planning to return over $1.9 billion to shareowners this year. We are keenly focused on balancing strategic inorganic investment with consistent and transparent capital return. And quarters like this one give us tremendous flexibility to continue on this path.","With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to start the Q&A. Steve?","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So, please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you.","Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Blake, just a question on auto. So, the downturn, I imagine that was worse than what you expected. Just what do you see in \u2013 what happened in the quarter versus expectation? And then as you think about 2019, you mentioned comps are easier, but how do we think about the reemergence of growth there? Are you seeing anything structural there in terms of spending for your customers?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, auto \u2013 Rich, our auto spend has been stable for the last few quarters against in particular the last two quarters a very difficult comp. So, we get some help as those comps fade in Q4. We continue to see a lot of activity in some of the new areas of expansion for us like EV and powertrain. Particularly with EV, the number of startup companies around the world that we're engaged with as well as their tier suppliers is expanding. So, there's a fairly optimistic outlook in terms of new programs in that particular area.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Would you expect to see some growth next year?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, we'll talk about our guidance in November for 2019.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just real quick on projects. A couple months ago, you're talking about seeing larger projects or customers being more detail with their project activity. I mean what's the update there in terms as we think about growth into the end of the calendar year?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Rich, if you're talking about general project activity, including heavy industries, we are seeing some of that activity actually result in orders. We talked a little bit earlier about NioCorp which was a big mining project, and we're happy to announce that we also received a major order from Codelco, again, in mining in Latin America. They're the largest copper producer globally located in Chile. We're going to be the main automation contractor for the Chuquicamata underground mine expansion. It's a significant order. It involves a lot of our new value from things like network services and remote monitoring. So, we are seeing some of that project activity convert into orders.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll pass now.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you talk about how you're managing your supply chain with all these tariffs on whether it's electronic components and things like that? And then maybe touch on what your customers like some of these machine builders \u2013 do you have kind of a look into what their supply chain looks like? And is there any kind of disruption to the customers that they may be kind of rethinking bids or anything like that, given all the moving parts around maybe parts that they're sourcing from China?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I'll make a couple of comments on that and then Patrick might have some additional color. Rockwell has the worldwide supply chain and a manufacturing footprint and they're flexible. And a lot of our customers enjoy similar amount of flexibility in their supply chain. So at this point, speaking about Rockwell, we don't expect significant disruption to our internal operations and we don't expect a material financial impact.","But the uncertainty is certainly not helpful to us or our customers. And so proactively, getting in front and looking at not only mitigation factors for the tariffs that have been enacted, as well as looking at others that are being considered, I think, it's the key thing to give us as much lead time as possible to move around things, if necessary.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We would also say, Steve, that we haven't seen any material changes yet at our customers.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last one, just on electronics. Been a lot of noise around CapEx there and varying degrees of weakness at some of the more \u2013 the heavier robot suppliers. You guys have kind of a small presence, but I think it's been growing. What did electronics do in the quarter and what's your outlook and just remind us of what percentage of the business that is?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Steve, semiconductor, as we call it, was up double-digits in the quarter, was up in every region. And at this point, it's about 5% of our global sales.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. That takes the fabs and the foundries as well as the actual downstream electronics manufacturing and it continues to be strong for us around the world.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, and good morning, all.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. I just wanted to make sure, as I look to your kind of implied fourth quarter organic growth, it looks like somewhere around 7.5%, so certainly some kind of acceleration. Given all the comments you've made around heavy industry and some of these other areas, I mean, what would you say is sort of the biggest component of driving kind of acceleration in the growth rates?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Steve, Patrick here. So we've seen good growth in heavy industry in Q3. Consumer actually did quite well as well in Q3. The big change in Q4 \u2013 and Blake alluded to that \u2013 is what's happening in automotive. Automotive has been about flat, and I call this plus or minus 5%, 6%, for three, four quarters in a row. And in Q4, we basically lapped an easier comp. And so a headwind on auto growth that we've seen of about a point, actually a little bit more than a point in Q3, goes away in Q4. And so our organic growth from 5.7% in Q3, add a little bit more than a point to that and you get close to what the implied growth rate is in Q4. So a key element is we expect easier comps in auto.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think the other comment is that we have meaningfully increased our backlog. And while some of that will go into fiscal 2019, that'll have some impact on Q4 as well.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just a quick comment on the mix \u2013 margin impact from mix as your mix is shifting now. Can you just give us a little more color on \u2013 there are a lot of puts and takes not just at the full segment level, but intra segment, given consumer, auto, everything else you've got going on?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Just one comment, and then Patrick will add some detail. But amidst the higher growth in heavy industry, so we saw a pretty good quarter in terms of margin expansion. So we're pleased with our ability to continue to have high levels of core conversion as well as margin expansion, even with a little heavier contribution from Process and heavy industries.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Steve, your question, was that related to Q3, the outlook for the year?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Oh yeah, outlook. No. No. No, the outlook for the year.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","For the...","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","For Q4.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","...outlook for the \u2013 yeah. So for Q4 compared to our prior guidance, we expect a little favorable impact from mix, again, versus our prior guidance, mostly related to higher expected growth in A&S, also in Logix, part of which we've seen in the third quarter, which also explains our very strong margins in the third quarter.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Please go ahead.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Rick.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Just two questions. Blake or Patrick, could you throw some color around that book-to-bill, just on a couple fronts? One is you mentioned some heavy industry projects that came in around mining. But I'm curious maybe what that book-to-bill looks like by industry, where the strength was? And then also, Blake, is there any cycle commentary around that book-to-bill and where that strength is or was in bookings?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I can make some comments about the book-to-bill. As Patrick mentioned, it was strong. It was certainly helped by some of these mining orders that we've talked about. It's going to be weighted towards heavy industries with the large Process component in there. We don't have the specific breakdown by vertical for that, but as we've been talking about, there's been a lot of activity in the planning and budgeting stages for some of these major capital projects in heavy industries. And some of them are starting to come to fruition and resulting in orders.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And any cycle commentary in terms of macro investment cycle commentary around the book-to-bill and where you're seeing that strength?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","We've seen some of the mining companies announce long-planned projects that are expected to have a multiyear impact on their capacity. And even though we've seen copper dip a little bit recently, they've made decisions to increase productivity or capacity in some of these mines. So I think we're seeing really at the starting phase of some of these projects converting into orders. In general, the macro conditions are favorable.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then just as my follow-up, around Logix growth at 10%, I'm a little bit curious the strength there maybe by end market, if you can see that. Given that auto was on the softer side, that's pretty impressive Logix growth. Just curious what your take is there?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, one of the strengths of Logix is that it does a really good job across a wide variety of industries. So, of course, Logix is used in automobile and truck assembly around the world. But it's also being used in Process around the world. And so, the good growth in oil and gas in the U.S. will spur additional Logix growth, particularly with the larger processors. And so, we think that there's a healthy mix of oil and gas that's spurring some of that Logix outgrowth.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I see. Great. Very good. Thank you.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. So, just sticking to the two questions. I guess my first one would be around any update on the investment or overhead spending. I think you talked before about $70 million increase for the year and sort of $45 million of that coming in the second half. Is that still the case? And, Patrick, you had called out a couple of times that the corporate cost moving up maybe as a result, so any kind of detail on that please.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. Julian, we expect our overall spend to be up between $70 million, $80 million for the full year. And for Q3, our year-over-year spend was up a little less than $25 million. We expect the Q4 spend to go up sequentially and it will be up year-over-year also by about $25 million. So basically in line with what we shared before with you. As to general corporate net, the increase there is mostly related to some of the transactions or to the large transaction that you have seen us announce in the third quarter. So specifically the PTC transaction, that's the majority of the increase in GCN.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And then my second question would just be around the top line. As you said, the quarter did come in better than you saw it on organic sales. It doesn't sound like it was automotive or process industries that came in above. So, was it really driven by consumer? And if you could give any color, is there demand changed as you went through the quarter in any meaningful way?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Julian, the three verticals that came in somewhat better than what we expected, one is food and beverage. I mentioned earlier that consumer had a good quarter in Q3. Food and beverage was the main driver there. And then metals and semiconductor were a little bit better than expected as well.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to circle back to Steve's question on some of your Japanese discrete peers. I recognize that there are more indexed smartphone, electronics and auto. But what does that tell us about the cycle? And the spirit of the question is around the FY 2019 outlook.","And you've got mid-teens growth in your systems business within CPS. So, you're not seeing overall weakness or anything like that that they are? But just under the covers, are there any concerns that you're seeing for FY 2019? And I'm just wondering is this just an end-market mix issue. Is it a geographic mix issue? Any color there would be great.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Looking at the general outlook, it remains positive with broad-based underpinning across industries and geographies. We had a strong sales quarter. We also had a very strong orders quarter, as represented by that 1.12 book-to-bill. And across regions, we're seeing optimism for the future. I think one of the particular areas around semiconductor is this continues to be a strength for us. And again in terms of actual sales as well as orders looking forward, we continue to see strength there as we expand our capabilities in that particular industry.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Okay. That's fine. And then just going back again to auto and transports, it sounds like we're hitting easier comps in 4Q, so we get that year-over-year lift. And you remain optimistic in terms of your commentary. So, if you think about all of the work around EV, self-driving, flying cars and all that stuff, and then the legacy OEMs, are we seeing pressure from sort of legacy spends offset by upticks in these new areas? And again we're seeing the OEM profitability under pressure, tariffs, et cetera. So, any additional color in terms of what you're seeing in the end market between maybe legacy versus new would be useful.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Let me first say that we don't expect significant revenue from flying cars in the foreseeable future. I will say that the uptick in transportation should be balanced between the projects both in our traditional internal combustion engine customers as well as EV and between projects as well as the MRO spend. So, we see it both contribute \u2013 the project as well as the MRO spend both contribute to a healthy business.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Just one additional comment on the auto side. We've talked about the opportunity to increase our share of the customer's spend with the new value from The Connected Enterprise. And so, in addition to the basic automation, the controller-based projects that affect both EV as well as traditional automobile manufacturing, the opportunity now accelerated with our relationship with PTC to add additional value through the information software and the associated services, that's come into fruition as we have discussions with those automobile manufacturers.","So in the past, we might expected to have projects that included the controllers and the drives and the industrial components. But now, the opportunity to dramatically increase the monetization of the value we're providing at those automobile manufacturers and their tier suppliers with the software to be able to track production, to be able to monitor quality, all those things is an exciting additional opportunity that we have at customers even if they were already standardized on all of our basic control equipment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Hey. Good morning, guys. Hello. How are you doing?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","So can I ask you about China in the sense that it grew 10% in the quarter? We know you said that China will grow slightly less than 10% for FY 2018. Maybe you can talk about visibility at this point into China growth. Obviously, there's been a bunch of questions about tariffs. But China just announced a stimulus plan here earlier this year. So, do you still see broad-based growth in China and any sort of early visibility into 2019?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Let me start with a couple of comments about the current contributors to growth in China, and then Patrick might have some additional comment. So, the strength in China includes semiconductor, which we'd talked about before; oil and gas, particularly on the refining side; life sciences, which although it's still relatively small as a standalone vertical for us, continues to contribute high growth; and then water and wastewater, as China continues to build out infrastructure in that. And that obviously contributes to some of our Process as well. So, those are some of the industries that are important to us currently in China. We have not seen a dampening effect from the tariff discussion at this point.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Andy, I would just add that through three quarters, most of our verticals in China are up. And for the full year, we still expect growth in the high-single-digits, a little less than 10% in this country.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","Okay. That's helpful, guys. And then responding to your comments on Europe, it did turn positive again in the quarter, but still somewhat lethargic, up 1%. You mentioned that heavy industries haven't come back yet there. What do you think that is? And do you worry a little bit more about that region here towards the end of this fiscal year and as we go into 2019?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The primary story in EMEA for us has been the weak automotive growth and we continue to look at strength in consumer in Europe as encouraging. We're pleased that our performance in the emerging European markets continue to show higher than average growth, but automotive is still the primary story in Europe.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I would just add, Andy, that for oil and gas, we haven't seen the pickup yet in the North Sea, where it's more expensive to extract. And so, we haven't seen that pickup there as we've seen, for example, in the U.S. for oil and gas.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi Research","That's helpful, guys. Thanks.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So, my first question I guess maybe just focused on the implied 4Q guidance, and I'm really kind of thinking about how you get to the high end of the range for 4Q. It looks like, to Steve's comment earlier, you've got about 7.5% organic growth in there. The restructuring actions that you took last year should reverse I would assume in this fourth quarter. And then on top of that, are you guys thinking a 40% to 50% type incremental margin? Just any color on that would be helpful.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah, if you exclude the restructuring charges, Joe, for the fourth quarter, we expect earnings conversion of about 30%, 35%. And so another way you can think about it is Q4 margins versus Q3. I mentioned early that for Q4, we expect segment margin to be a little less than 21%. We expect the benefit of higher sales versus Q3. You heard me say earlier that spend is going to be up \u2013 our investment spending, I should say, will be up. Mix is always sequentially a slight negative in the fourth quarter, given the typical pickup we see in solutions and services. And then I mentioned earlier that we'll see a modest headwind related to some of our input cost, the tariffs that I referred to earlier as well.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. That's helpful, Patrick. And maybe if I can just touch on that point. I know you'll give a lot more color in November on 2019, but is there anything you can tell us about what you expect the tariffs impact? And also, is there incremental spending that you're expecting as well for 2019, just given how good growth has been?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. Just one comment, and I think it's the obvious one. And we're an American company, and America is by far our largest market. And we do think that we and our customers can compete and win around the world. So, when government action is necessary, we favor a strategic approach that aligns us with our allies. But to your specific question, America is by far our largest market, and we certainly don't expect any of this to have a dampening effect on the number of facilities in America that require our offerings.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Joe, I'm not getting into fiscal 2019 and what tariffs might amount to or spending. That's something that we'll share with everyone in November.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you both.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking our questions. This is Kristen on for Noah. I just wanted to ask a little bit about the PTC relationship. Forward-looking, how does that change your views on planning investments in software and analytics? And where do you see any gaps in that portfolio now?","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, as we mentioned before, Kristen, that we believe that we have the most comprehensive, flexible information software offering in the industry. So we're very happy with what we can offer customers today. We were already growing at double-digits in the Information Solutions and Connected Services area. This will accelerate that growth to help customers unlock even more productivity. We continue to invest in these areas.","We've had artificial intelligence offerings for a while. Those will be incorporated with additional enhancements into the combined offering that we'll offer customers that will take the best of what PTC and Rockwell have. So we continue to invest organically in these areas as well. But this brings us at speed to having such a strong offering that we can provide today because it's a fast-growing area and we think we have the opportunity to be a first-mover at many of these customers and in many of these industries.","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And then if I could follow-up on that, Steve, I think you mentioned that some of the incremental corporate expense is going towards the development from that relationship. Can you shed a little bit more color on that? Is that sales? Is that technology development? Just a little color on that.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah, the expenses I was referring to in general corporate net are really related to the actual transaction rather than ongoing expenses. We will have some ongoing expenses associated with PTC. We're adding some sales resources. We also shared with investors that we're working on a common technology roadmap. So, we're making some investments there. But that is not part of GCN. That is part of ongoing investments that we're making now and we'll be making next year.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yeah. I think the additional comment about our spend is with the relationship with PTC, it allows us to focus our spend on the differentiated value. And an example that we've used before is augmented reality. We think augmented reality has a lot of good valuable applications in production environments. But having the relationship with a top supplier with a strong offering keeps us from having to invest resources and having another offering that may or may not be differentiated. So, it allows us to focus on areas that are the most prioritized in terms of differentiating the combined offering.","Kristen Owen - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you. I will pass it on.","Steven W. Etzel - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Justin Bergner from Gabelli & Co. Please go ahead.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Oh. Good morning, Blake. Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","In regards to the strength in your Architecture & Software business, I mean you spoke about the consumer strength in food and beverage and seems like the fourth quarter anticipates the carry forward of that strength. Maybe if you could just provide a little bit more color on what's driving the strength in Architecture & Software and the sustainability of that strength versus sort of your expectations earlier in the year?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think some of it goes back to what Blake referred to earlier, our largest business in that segment, includes our Logix business. And you will find our Logix product and software across all industries, where they are discrete or Process. And so, with the pickup in some of the heavy industry that we're seeing, besides good growth in consumer, we see that reflected in Architecture & Software. And that business is more exposed to heavy industries within Architecture & Software than, for example, motion or our sensing business in that segment. And so, it also leads to a somewhat favorable mix that you see reflected in the margins of that segment.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think the additional comment is that all of our products and offerings really contribute to bringing The Connected Enterprise to life. And so, as that strategy continues to find favor with customers, it's going to raise the overall offering because those products from A&S and from CP&S all contribute the data that ultimately is turned into useful information and supports the growth of some of the new areas of value, the information software and those high value services. So, it brings it all up as customers endorse that idea of connecting their enterprise.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Okay. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that. I mean the Information Solutions and Connected Services revenue, that $300 million, is that disproportionately weighted towards Architecture & Software versus CP&S? Or is it split pretty much pro rata versus the sales split?","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Today, it's a little bit split more towards Control Products & Solutions than it is Architecture & Software.","Justin Laurence Bergner - Gabelli & Company","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions.","Blake Moret - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you. Your...","Operator","I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Etzel for closing remarks.","Steven W.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to hand -- turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thank you, Sonia. Good morning, everyone, on the call. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the third quarter and our outlook for the full year. Then Ted will provide more detail on both of those, and we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. Since this is our third quarter and we will not be commenting on our outlook beyond fiscal 2013, I'm thinking this call may only last 45 minutes. But we'll see how things go, and we're certainly prepared to go the full hour, if that makes sense.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I know it's been a busy earnings season for all of you, so I appreciate your time today and your interest in Rockwell Automation. I hope you all are able to get and enjoy some R&R and family time during the month of August. First portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.","I'm pleased with our results this quarter, both from a sales and earnings perspective. Sales grew 4% organically in the quarter. Even more importantly, we saw sequential growth in all regions and across both segments, which was consistent with our expectations of better sales performance in the second half. I'll try to head off a few of your questions by giving you more color by region and by verticals.","Sales growth in the U.S. and Canada was solid, with oil and gas the best performing vertical in both regions. EMEA grew 3% despite the continued recession in Western Europe. Oil and gas was strong, and mining remained weak. Sales in Asia Pacific were down 8% year-over-year but up 20% sequentially. China showed the largest improvement from last quarter, and sales were up 5% year-over-year. However, we are still seeing project delays with a number of projects now pushed into fiscal '14. So whether you link it to liquidity, the decline in exports, overcapacity or uncertainty, investment levels remain relatively weak in China. But as I said last quarter, we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects for China. The evolution to a more consumption-based economy will drive investments in consumer packaged goods manufacturing, which is a sweet spot for us. All of the other countries in Asia Pacific were down in the quarter, with the exception of Japan.","Latin America continues to be the standout region, with 23% growth this quarter. Mexico and Brazil were both very strong with oil and gas, auto and consumer being the best performing verticals.","Before I end my comments on the top line, let me share a couple of other data points that I know you're always interested in. Process sales increased 2 points this quarter. We continue to get good traction with PlantPAx, but we are being negatively impacted by project delays, primarily in Asia.","Excluding Asia, process was up 9% in Q3. Logix was up 3% in the quarter, a bit better than the Architecture & Software segment as a whole. So on 4% sales growth in the quarter, we realized strong margin conversion and adjusted EPS growth of 12%.","Segment operating margin expanded both sequentially and year-over-year in Q3. Frankly, I would've liked to have spent more in the quarter. That will change in Q4, and we will increase spending in engineering and selling resources to support our best growth opportunities and build for the future. On a year-to-date basis, margin expanded 30 basis points or 19%, a good result on only 1% organic growth year-to-date.","So onto the outlook. Across the regions, we expect market conditions to remain stable through the end of the fiscal year. Based on this outlook, and with 3 quarters behind us, we now expect sales to be about $6.3 billion for the fiscal year, which represents about 1% organic growth. Even with sales moving to the lower end of our previous range, we're raising the midpoint of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05, and narrowing the range to $5.50 to $5.70. Ted will go into more detail on guidance.","I've a few closing remarks before handing off to Ted to go through the rest of the slides. Automation Fair is in Houston this year, and we will be holding our Investor Conference on Thursday, November 14th. This is a great opportunity to learn about our capabilities, as well as those of our partners. Being in Houston, there will obviously be an emphasis on oil and gas and Process. So please mark your calendars, and we hope to see a lot of you there.","I want to thank our employees and partners for great execution and their unwavering commitment to providing value to our customers. We performed well this year in spite of the low growth environment. We will continue to improve our market position, invest for growth and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised outlook for the remainder of 2013. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will continue to reference the slides that Rondi and Keith mentioned. And I'll start on Page 5, third quarter results summary. Revenue in the quarter was $1,624,000,000. That's up 4% compared to the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency and acquisitions was negligible, so sales were up 4% organically as well.","Segment operating earnings in the current period were $318 million, up 9% compared to Q3 last year. General corporate net was $20.9 million in Q3, and that compares to $18.3 million in the same period last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 22%. That compares to an adjusted effective rate in Q3 last year of 22.6%. Through 9 months, the adjusted effective rate was 24%. The adjusted effective rate was lower in the third quarter due to a discrete tax event related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.54. As Keith noted, that's up 12% compared to $1.37 in the same quarter last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 140.4 million. We repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares in the third quarter at a cost of about $104 million. At the end of Q3, there was approximately $619 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we've repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares for about $318 million. So we continued to run slightly ahead of the rate required to hit the $400 million full year repurchase expectation that we talked about on the previous earnings calls this year.","Turning to Page 6. This is a graphical version of total company results for the third quarter. Looking at the left side of the chart, you'll see the 4% year-over-year sales increase. Sales increased sequentially by 7%. On the right side of the chart, total segment earnings are displayed. You can see the 9% year-over-year increase in segment operating earnings. Sequentially, segment operating earnings increased by 11%. Total segment operating margin in Q3 was 19.6%, a strong margin result and healthy conversion on a year-over-year basis. Operating margin increased 0.9 points compared to third quarter last year and sequentially.","In the year-over-year and sequential comparison, the margin increase is primarily due to volume leverage, but the year-over-year comparison also benefited from continued productivity performance. As we discussed last quarter, the productivity includes savings from the restructuring actions taken in Q4 last year. We haven't fully redeployed those savings. Also, a strong contribution from cost reduction and process improvement initiatives, again, this quarter, and continued tight controls on discretionary spending.","As Keith mentioned, we intended to spend more in the third quarter, and we were unable to add headcount in some very targeted areas as fast as we had planned.","While not on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31% at the end of the third quarter.","On Page 7, this is a summary of the Q3 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased year-over-year by 1% to $671 million. That's also a 1% organic increase. Sales were up 5% sequentially. Operating margin for the quarter was 28.1%. That's up 0.2 point compared to Q3 last year and up 1.5 points sequentially.","On the next page, Page 8, this covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales were $953 million, up 6% compared to Q3 last year. Again, also a 6% organic increase. Sales of the product businesses and the solutions and services businesses were both up about 6% year-over-year. Sales in the segment increased 8% sequentially, with an 11% sequential increase in the solutions and services businesses.","Book-to-bill for the solutions and services businesses was 1.0. In Q3, we experienced a larger sequential increase in solutions and services than was the case the past 2 years. Consequently, we don't expect to see as large a sequential increase in this Q4 as we experienced last year.","On the right side of this chart, operating earnings increased by 21% year-over-year on the 6% sales increase. Operating margin increased by 1.7 points year-over-year to 13.6%, and increased by 0.6 points sequentially. The year-over-year margin improvement was primarily due to volume leverage and productivity.","Switching to the next page, this is a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'm going to focus my comments on the far right column, which displays year-over-year organic growth. And I'll also provide some region color on sequential growth. Basically, we experienced sequential growth in all regions and year-over-year growth in all regions except Asia Pacific. The U.S. was up 4% in Q3, both year-over-year and sequentially. Among the regions, the U.S. has been a relatively stable market environment this year, and through 9 months, the year-over-year organic growth was also 4%.","Canada was up 10% year-over-year in Q3, and up 14% sequentially. Year-to-date, Canada is up 3%.","Latin America continued as the highest growth region, up 23% in Q3, with particularly strong growth in Brazil and Mexico. Latin America was up 18% sequentially. And year-to-date, Latin America is up 12%.","EMEA was up 3% year-over-year in the quarter and up 2% sequentially. Through 9 months, EMEA is down 1%. Asia Pacific was down 8% year-over-year in Q3, with growth in China and Japan more than offset by declines in the balance of the region. Asia Pacific was up 20% sequentially. And year-to-date, Asia Pacific is down 12%.","China was up 5% year-over-year. But despite the growth in Q3, China is down 8% through 9 months.","I'll turn now to Page 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $264 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is approximately 104%, and we expect conversion now to be somewhat above 100% for the full year.","And that takes us to the final slide, Page 11, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '13. As Keith mentioned, we're updating the guidance. Given third quarter sales and ending backlog, and with only one quarter to go in the fiscal year, we'll drop the high end of the sales guidance and narrow the range. We now expect sales for the full year to be approximately $6.3 billion. You can think of that as plus or minus perhaps $50 million. That represents a range of organic growth for the full year of between 0% and 2%, and previous guidance was 0% to 3%. Compared to previous guidance, we lost about $30 million of topline for the full year due to currency changes, particularly a strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to currencies other than the euro.","This guidance continues to reflect higher sales in the second half of our fiscal year, primarily driven by improvement in our solutions and services businesses. We expect segment margin for the full year to be about 19%. That's up slightly compared to 18.9% in our previous guidance. In part, that reflects the strong margin performance in Q3. The margin guidance also anticipates somewhat higher spending in Q4. We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $5.50 to $5.70. So once again, we've narrowed the range but also increased the midpoint by $0.05. We now expect the adjusted effective tax rate to be closer to 24% compared to 25% in our previous guidance. The lower tax rate adds about $0.03 to $0.04 to the full year EPS guidance. We still expect to spend about $400 million on share repurchases this year.","And finally, we continue to expect general corporate net expense to be about $83 million for the full year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi and we'll begin Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks, Ted. [Operator Instructions] So Sonia, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Keith, could you just expand a little bit on China? I mean, we did finally see some growth in that region. You talked to project delays. I presume those delays are on the Process side as opposed to more of the discrete markets. Could you just kind of characterize maybe the tone of business in Process and discrete and how that looks as we head through the fourth and into the fiscal '14?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, I'd be happy to, Rick. I think your comment is correct, and that is the majority of the delays are in project businesses. And because Process -- you sell Process as projects, it's overweight in the Process side. That's one of the reasons I called out the rest of the Process business and the growth that we've seen, which was at 9%. China is a meaningful part, and Asia, in general, is a meaningful part of our Process business in the regions. So that does hurt us. In the discrete -- on the discrete side, we did see a little bit of growth in the OEM space, particularly indigenous tire OEMs, as the Chinese tire industry continues to expand to meet the, I'll just call it the local demand. So that was probably the best positive performer on the discrete side.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and would you say discrete in China then, I guess, it must have grown north of 5% at least in the quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. To get it to the 5% and to offset the process\/solutions side, discrete would've grown more and it would've been driven by OEM, and to some degree, automotive.","Operator","The next question comes from Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Ted, I just wanted to dig into -- you called out solutions' book-to-bill of 1.0, and referring to the Q-to-Q uptick in solutions in 3Q, you've referenced that 4Q might not see the same seasonal uptick. But just looking back at last year, we had a 1.0 book-to-bill in 3Q '12, yet still saw a decent uptick in 4Q '12. I'm just wondering whether the project delays we've seen in, you referenced in China, is impacting that deferral or rather a small uptick in the Q-to-Q. So I guess what I'm saying is with same the book-to-bill in 3Q '13 as 3Q '12, why wouldn't we see the same uptick Q-to-Q?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I mean I think if you look at the last 2 years, the level of sequential increase we saw Q3 to Q4 in solutions and services was in the range of high-teens to 20%. And if you went back to the years before that, those 2 years were kind of an unusually large sequential increase. So when we look at the backlog and the timing of the backlog that we've got at the end of Q3, we're just not expecting as large a sequential increase this Q4, and something that looks more normal compared to the years before the last 2.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's clear. And then, the cash balance, over $1 billion, and I know a large part of that is overseas. The prospect of corporate tax reform is becoming lower by the day. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about that overseas cash balance and any strategies that you have to maybe repatriate those funds.","Theodore D. Crandall","I mean every year, we look for ways to repatriate funds that we can do in a cost-effective manner, and there's some amount that we were able to do every year. But I would say about 90% of our current cash balance is not easily available to us in the U.S. And we are hoping that through corporate tax reform at some point in the future, that we'll get some relief from that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So is it just stay steady and hope for the best there?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, look, we always have that money available for acquisitions outside the United States, and we will continue to use it for that purpose.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just had a question really on the automotive end market, in particular. You'd mentioned China remains very healthy there. But I was more interested in the trends you're seeing on CapEx in North America and Europe.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, the easy one is Europe. There's not much CapEx in Europe. I think you're starting to see the announcements of closings, which is pretty much going to replay what happened in the U.S., 3-plus years ago. And as they go through that, their need for capital in EMEA will be weak. However, many of the Europeans are investing outside of the region, and we would expect that part to continue. In the U.S., we continue to see a high level of CapEx. And now we haven't seen that growing. But it's stayed at a high level, and certainly forward, had a very strong performance, including some of the actions in Europe. General Motors, if you take out Europe, have performed reasonably well and announced new investments in Mexico. And likewise, Chrysler continues to be the star performer in the Fiat group. So I would say the investments in the Americas continues to be strong, and we see that maybe not at quite as high a level, but certainly at a good level into the future.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then within the CP&S segment, you've had very good profit margins the last 6 months. Is that mostly productivity or is there something maybe happening in terms of the mix of the projects that you are billing, maybe they're higher-margin projects or something like that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, certainly, there's a couple of things there. We continue to work really hard at having successful projects and, as all of you know, the project business, they don't always turn out that way. But I think the leadership team has been doing a good job of managing those projects and driving productivity. And I would say that's where the majority of the benefits have come. However, to your point, there is some mix within the solutions area, and that also probably has been outgrowing the pure engineering, as evidenced by the lower growth in our Process business that we talked about, which is all engineered solutions. So our motor control center business performs very well and some of our -- not some of -- our drives business is also performing well. So I think it's a little bit of mix, but more importantly, continued good execution and driving productivity.","Theodore D. Crandall","And Julian, I think the modest growth that we have seen this year has pretty much been all in the CP&S side of our business. And so we're benefiting from a little bit of volume leverage there as well.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess in the fourth quarter, your margin is down quarter-over-quarter. I guess you mentioned some of the incremental spending that you're doing. Is that -- does that like establish a run rate of spending, is that stuff that you kind of pushed forward, you're just kind of waiting to see how the markets play out and so you're kind of establishing a new run rate there? Or are these kind of like one-time type of investments?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Our goal is to establish a new run rate. That was what we talked about when we took the restructuring in our fourth quarter last year, that we wanted to create the opportunity to have some targeted investment. We certainly were careful as we went through the first half of the year. And as we mentioned earlier, with what we believe today anyways is a stable environment, we are trying to increase some very targeted spending in development engineering and selling resources to continue to penetrate the best opportunities that we have on a global basis. So it would be an increase in the run rate as we exit Q4.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess, from that perspective, I guess, that kind of says you're a little bit more confident, maybe a tad bit more confident about the future, at least things aren't rolling over. How did trends kind of play out April, May and June for you guys?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, we are a tad bit more confident, yes. But the third quarter is generally one for us that is really the most consistent quarter, start to finish. And I would say that is what we saw happen again this quarter. Obviously, some variation, but pretty steady throughout. As we go into the fourth quarter, all of you know that it is probably -- not probably, it is our most back-end loaded quarter that we have. We always talk about a strong September. And July tends to be reasonably strong. And so far, we believe July is going to match what our expectations are for the quarter and in our guidance. And then August is the tough one because of Europe, for sure. We also see now U.S. vacations for a couple of weeks in there before school starts has taken on a pretty strong presence. And so that's why September becomes so important. And once again, it is a back-end loaded quarter, and that's certainly what we're expecting this quarter as well.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I think one of the auto guys said that they're not going to do as many shutdowns. Maybe I misread that. Are you guys seeing that as well? Maybe these guys producing a little more here in the normal slowdown period or no?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I mean I don't know that personally. But given the strong sales, that might have something to do with it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So that would contribute -- if that is the case, that would kind of offset some of the concerns around go against what you're talking about as being more muted seasonality, if that is the case, right, that would help you guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, it might hurt a little bit because during those shutdowns is when they do a lot of the, I'll say, maintenance on the existing lines. And it's when they're running out the new lines. So I would say, it probably doesn't mean a lot to us. But I would say a slight -- a very slight negative just from an MRO standpoint.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry, one last quick one. I know pension, you guys, on the operating side, it's less of a dynamic. But the -- I guess, with rates moving the way they are, did that change -- did that free up some cash for you guys from a funding perspective for next year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean we didn't make any -- we had no mandatory contributions this year, and weren't expecting to face any mandatory contributions next year. So I don't think it frees up any cash.","Steve, just one last point, your original question about margins. Basically, our expectation for fourth quarter margin is to be slightly below third quarter margin. So not a significant difference.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right, yes, but down sequentially. Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Davis, Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Keith, you made a comment in your prepared remarks, you just said you'd like to spend more. Can you just give us a sense on spend more on what? Is it sales, is it distribution, is it R&D, products, is it a little bit of everything? I mean just a sense of not just that question but also on a geographic basis, are there areas where you feel like you still need to invest?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, certainly, what I'm referring to is what I would call targeted investments. And we would target 2 very key areas for future growth. And this isn't going to be growth in Q4 or Q1 of next year. This is longer-term investments because the biggest part of it will go into product development and whether that -- and the majority of that into our A&S segment related to, basically, architecture, continued developments, software, firmware and those types of investments for new products, new capabilities, particularly around the information space and the controller\/I\/O areas, including visualization. Then, the second area that we will target will be selling resources so that we can take advantage of some of the growth areas that we see playing out stronger. That will be globally, but obviously, less of it than normal like Asia, just given the performance. But we think the U.S., a little bit in Latin America, with the great growth they've been having, we need to make sure that we're continuing to reinforce that. And then we do have good growth opportunities in select areas in Europe as well, including the Middle East, and of course, what we're doing with OEMs. So very targeted activities where we think we have the best chance of driving growth 12 to 24 months out.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow-up, guys. When you think about the build out of the gas chain over the next, call it, 5 years in the states. Do you have solutions capabilities that directly address that? I know you can sell some drives and hermetic motors, things like that into that market. But do you have specific solution capabilities that would be of demand to those customers?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We certainly believe in the fine chemicals area. We have our complete portfolio that is available in some of the first or, I should say, more of the upstream areas, where you're more into the, perhaps boat chemicals. There, we have a very strong Intelligent Motor Control offering, as well as process safety. And depending on the applications, the seal ratings of our Logix controllers can also be applied in the DCS end of those systems. So we continue to have meaningful solutions capabilities for many of the segments that will start growing if those projects are allowed to proceed, and I think that's a big if today. And obviously, the ongoing efforts with all the pipelines that need to take that gas to the final destination, we have a portfolio, and that's one of our strengths in the oil and gas areas. So we expect that to continue to be strong as well.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just to clarify, Keith, you have a -- I mean in your opinion, at least, do you have a safety product that can compete directly with some of the guys that are known for that product, in particular Invensys, I guess -- known for that product in things like refineries?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, absolutely. We believe we're known for that product with ICS T. So we've been a supplier to that space. I should say they have, and we have been, since we acquired that company. And we have every bit the capability of Triconex and Invensys, except we do not do nuclear and they do nuclear. So I want to be clear there. That's an area where we don't participate, and I would say they have probably almost -- they have a very strong position in that space. But other than that, we can compete across the board with Invensys.","Operator","The next question comes from John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So just based on the trend, do you expect the solutions' book-to-bill to trend below 1 in this quarter, Keith or Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, John, I would say it's very typical for us, because shipments tend to be higher in Q4, it's very typical for us to have a solutions book-to-bill below 1 in Q4. Whether that will be the case or not this year, we'll have to wait and see.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So that would not be unusual? Maybe, is there some context you could put around the fact that we started the year so strong in solutions' book-to-bill and then it sort of has -- whether it's kind of normal pattern or not, it does seem to continue to trend lower? Is that because there were specific projects\/region that was driving this that's being shipped and now we're in a kind of a flattish environment, and you just don't see anything else picking up? Or is it a timing issue? Like just maybe is there any kind of color that, Keith or Ted, you could comment on with respect to the pattern that we've seen over the last few quarters versus, say, historical and what you might have otherwise expected?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think yes, but you got to go back a little bit longer than the last couple of quarters. I mean, if you went back to the second-half, some of it is just the lumpiness of project business. And if you went back to the second half of last year, Q3 and Q4 were relatively weak quarters for us in terms of solutions orders. That's why we started the year with a very weak backlog, even though we had good shipments in the second half of last year. And basically, we replenished that backlog across the first quarter, so we started to catch up from an orders point of view. And our solutions sales are going to be higher now in the second half as a consequence of that. I'd say order rates now were kind of at a more normalized level.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","But you're not being more, say, project selective or -- nothing else you would call out? Because I wouldn't think solutions, given the nature, would have 1 or 2 big projects driving it? That doesn't make a lot of sense, so...","Theodore D. Crandall","No, it's not 1 or 2 big projects.","Keith D. Nosbusch","And certainly, in our business, it is not the megaprojects that we book, although in any 1 quarter, we could shift a meaningful-sized project and that could give us a plus. Like Ted said, that's the lumpiness of this business. But for us to have projects over $10 million, it's -- we don't have a lot of those, unlike some of the other companies that report specific projects wins. So we think we have a much broader set of applications that we can support. And we can do that geographically in the different industries. So we tend to see 1 or 2 of those large projects in any quarter create that lumpiness. And then the wildcard is always the timing, when do they go out. And that can be delayed a couple of weeks or a couple of months. Although we haven't seen any uptick, other than in Asia, of delays in the backlog shipments. So that hasn't been the problem either.","Theodore D. Crandall","To answer your question about being more selective, we aren't being more selective. We're excited about the opportunity to grow our solutions business. It's critical to our participation in Process. And I think what you're seeing more than anything else is just a higher level of variability quarter-to-quarter in the orders and solutions than we would see in our product business.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That makes sense. Keith, how did mining do in the quarter? I mean, Latin America is continuing to be very robust. I guess, some of the window into mining, sort of Australia, New Zealand. Just remind us again how big is mining, and obviously, what's weak is U.S. coal mining, right? That could be still very, very weak next year. How significant is that and just what's kind of happening in your mining vertical?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, mining is about 8% of our sales today. And with respect to coal mining, that's where we have the least participation. So we do not see the impact of coal as a big impact to our business. So I would take that out of the equation of the dynamics in the market. For us, anyways. It's meaningful for others. But for us, it's the smallest mining piece that we have. I would say, in general, mining is slowing. We've had some projects that we've shipped this quarter. It was part of the strong growth in Latin America, it was because of mining projects shipping. We're seeing a slow down. And you mentioned in particular where it's occurring, Australia, there was -- Australia and Brazil. And the reason I call out those 2 is because they're the major suppliers to China. And with the China slowdown, that has impacted the raw materials and the resources coming from the more heavily mining-centric economies. We also see continued slowness in mining in South Africa. And that has to do a little bit with some of the labor unrest there, but probably a little stronger because of the pricing of the precious metals. Mexico, the mining continues to be strong. Canada, I think, we're having strong sales there, but we do see that slowing as we go forward. So a pretty mixed bag at this point in time with respect to mining. But we do see where the mines are going to put more emphasis on productivity, as we go into the future. And we think that will be real positive for us in the future as well.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I could just ask one more. I want to go back to the question about sort of cash on balance sheet. And Ted, you sort of give the same answer every quarter. So I appreciate that your company has a balanced perspective towards capital allocation. That said, you are sitting on $1.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. And repatriation acts aside, assuming there isn't anything of that ilk, I mean, I guess I just don't see why Rockwell needs to be run with that much cash and short-term investments on balance sheet. Is there not something you can do, one-time special dividends, something like that? I mean what are you thinking of at this point? I just -- it would be great if you could repurchase more shares, but if you don't have the cash available, what -- you can't just let it sit and grow? So what are you thinking?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, so I mean I think that is fair. The money is available to us to do acquisitions outside the United States. As you know, we haven't been spending probably more than about $100 million a year on acquisitions. So unless we did something bigger, that won't change that in a meaningful way, I think if -- with the passage of time, it becomes clear that we aren't going to get any kind of relief from corporate tax reform, then we may have to consider some alternatives. But I do not think that now is the appropriate time to consider that.","Operator","The next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski, MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up to a comment you made in your prepared remarks about some of the big drivers in China, whether it's uncertainty, overcapacity or lack of liquidity. Keith, could you just kind of parse out what you're hearing most often, and which of those is the biggest issue in your opinion or what your customers are telling you?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think it depends on the industry that you're talking about. And if you look at infrastructure, in particular, steel, it's I would say predominantly overcapacity. And therefore, the government is not funding additional steel infrastructure projects. If you talk about the liquidity side of the equation, we've been talking about that for probably -- maybe almost going on 1 year now. But what we have seen previously is where that was hurting more the small and midsized companies. I think what happened in the last couple of months with liquidity is the government has made a focused effort to deal with the shadow banks, and more importantly, the interbank loan rates went up. And that started to impact some of the SOEs. And the local governments had to find other ways to fund their projects as opposed to being able to get it through some of the typical banks, and the cost was higher. And that's where we saw some of these added project delays. And so I would say that was the liquidity and capital structure of banks and interbank lending rates. And other than that, I think some of the OEM market has been hurt by the decline in exports, as opposed to liquidity. And in particular, exports to Europe have dropped dramatically. And so we see that in our OEM sector of the business. And I think that's probably a bunch of color there, so hopefully that parsed it a little bit for you.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, just thinking high-level on the margins, you guys are at cycle highs now. Where from a mix perspective can things get better? And how should we think about any of the headwinds that you're facing today, and how those come back in terms of the mix? Obviously, Europe is still kind of getting back on its feet. We just talked about pockets of China that could be better or worse going forward. How should we think about the cost to serve, to drive growth as those recover or just product mix from here?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think, Josh, the big factors in our margin performance are always going to be volume and then the mix between our products and solutions businesses. Those are always going to be the 2 biggest factors. And maybe to a lesser extent, given the volume level, the extent to which we're ramping our spending. And so, I think as it relates to spending, we have been in a position for about the last year, and I think we'll continue in this manner, where we're going to try and control this spending at levels that we think are appropriate to our current volume levels. Given volume, talking about volume, I think right now, we're expecting flat conditions for the fourth quarter, flat market conditions, basically from Q3 to Q4. And at this point, we're not ready to talk about next year. And in terms of solutions versus product mix, we have always said that we think our solutions business over the long term is going to grow faster than the product business because we're going to have faster-than-average growth in Process and faster-than-average growth in emerging market, and both of those tend to drive a higher solutions mix.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","That's fair. And do you want to see the spending come back before you start vetting out some of your own investment? Or are you willing to kind of take a leap of faith as we get a little bit of visibility on '14?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, as Keith discussed and as we said in our comments, we are going to deliberately increase spending somewhat as we go from Q3 into Q4. And that's based on -- we intended to do that in Q3 and weren't able to bring it on as quickly as we had planned. I think it was Steve who asked about level of confidence in the recovery, I'm not sure we have a lot higher confidence of growth but we're probably a little bit more confident that we're not going to see a decline. And so we are willing to up the spending level a bit.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","What was products sales year-on-year within CP&S increasing?","Keith D. Nosbusch","It was up 6%, the same as the segment.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, so pretty even, including solutions and services then?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Right.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Second, R&D, you've been running at about 4.1%, 4.2% annually. Can you give us a sense, I mean, given all the discussion in this call on the better incrementals margins and your expectations going forward for spending more, where specifically is R&D, where have you been running at roughly?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We've been running at roughly that level.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, and the level of spending we're talking about increasing in Q4 won't materially change that.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe just on Europe, that we saw, you said 2% up sequentially, overall for EMEA though. Maybe just a little more flavor on are you seeing Europe itself getting any better, or is this all Middle East, Africa?","Theodore D. Crandall","I would say the strength has been more Middle East than Africa. I think it's also fair to say that the northern countries continue to do a little bit better than the southern countries. And in this quarter, Eastern Europe didn't look a lot different than Western Europe.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think what we're starting to see in Europe is, and I'm now talking -- I mean, not Middle East and Africa or Russia. It's a little more choppiness where there's not a consistent environment in any country on an ongoing basis. And so, in any month, as Ted said, the northern could be strong. We have seen a couple of success stories in southern as well, but they're infrequent. So it's just a little bit more choppy and uneven in Western Europe at the moment. And to Ted's point, that's starting to now impact a little bit of Eastern Europe as that's where a lot of the linkages have been developed over the years.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And Keith, could I just sneak in one strategic one, which is in light of all the share gains you've had over the years in Process and in Logix, and potentially some of that on the back of your competitors' underinvestments, such as Invensys and given the announcements that have happened or the potential combinations with Invensys, presumably that underinvestment would make way to catch up investment over time. I mean, how do you see that impacting your approach or the marketplace?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, we don't think it will impact our position. We continue to add capability to our platform. We have been able to be successful in replacing legacy-install bases. We don't see that changing because those aren't going away. And added investment in this business certainly does not create a change in the market in the short or intermediate term. It takes a number of years to getting output from that investment and then another period of time to be able to generate the revenue from it. So we just are going to keep focused on expanding our footprint and enhancing our sales capabilities in the process space. And we are very confident in our ability to continue to grow independent of what happens in the external environment.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So you do have this offshore cash, deals would be the most logical way to deploy it, to Ted's point. I think you've made it pretty clear, the big deal that's out there to be done is not of interest, certainly sounds that way. But what does the acquisition horizon actually look like? Do you see bolt-ons that are clearly on your horizon? And maybe, in particular, maybe circling back, I think it was to Scott's question where you called out fine chemicals, honing in on that would also suggest that there's other vertical areas where software capabilities or whatever would really enhance what you're doing. So just any color there on what we could or maybe should expect on the M&A front, in say the next 12 or 24 months, not tomorrow necessarily.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Well, certainly, just to reinforce what Ted said and that is, we are trying to focus the majority of our M&A work outside the U.S., simply because we think that's where the best long-term growth opportunities are, and certainly, that would be the preferred path forward. And I would say, we continue to expand the search that we have going on, and we believe that we'll be able to generate additional acquisitions, and to your point, bolt-on acquisitions, as some of these companies mature, particularly in the emerging markets, where we're watching very carefully the smaller start-up companies that have competence and have capabilities as they continue to mature and develop. And so, that's one of the reasons we want to be careful with the utilization of that cash, so that we have the opportunity to make those acquisitions as we go forward. So the areas that we're looking at really haven't changed. It's where do we have technology gaps, where can we get domain expertise. And I would say in the recent past, domain expertise, particularly outside the U.S., has been a very fertile area for us, and we would expect that to continue. Services, as we continue to expand our portfolio and capabilities there, would be another important area for us to look at. And then, the point that you made with respect to software, we believe software is a continuous area to look at. And we have made a number of software acquisitions over the last decade. And we certainly believe that, that is an area that we can continue to add pieces to the portfolio that we have in the future.","Operator","I would now like to hand the call over to Rondi for closing remarks.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Not too many closing remarks other than just thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'll be available on the phone for any follow-up calls that you might have. So thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. At this time, you may now disconnect. Thank you."],"19271":["Rockwell Automation, Inc.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) ","At this time I would like to turn the call over to CFO, Ted Crandall. Please proceed, sir.","Theodore D. Crandall","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. I am filling in for Rondi today who unfortunately is a bit under the weather and unable to join us. Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO is here with me this morning. ","Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights of the company's performance in the first quarter and outlook for the full year. Then I will provide more detail on both of those and we\u2019ll take questions at the end of my remarks. ","Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","And with that I will turn it over to Keith. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Ted and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. I hope everyone is enjoying winter. I know we\u2019re all having fun with the snow and a bit of cold here in the Midwest. ","I will start with the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to Page four in the slide deck. We had a very good start to the year with 7% organic sales growth in the quarter. I will start with some color on the region and verticals. ","The U.S. led the way with 10% growth. Oil and gas and food and beverage were the strongest industries in the U.S. Canada sales were basically flat with mixed performance across the verticals. And EMEA enjoyed some momentum with 5% growth as they continue to find opportunities to grow and outperform the market. It was great to see Asia return to growth led by China. Latin America, our best growth region all of last year was a little soft due to difficult business climates in Argentina and Venezuela and weakness in mining across the region. However Brazil and Mexico continue to perform well as both grew double-digit. ","Overall the picture for verticals is similar to what we said last quarter. Oil and gas and food and beverage were the strongest, automotive was pretty flat and mining and metals were the weakest. Here are a couple of other sales related metrics that I know you are always interested in. Process grew 8% in the quarter with the U.S leading the way. We are now including vMonitor in our numbers, so our full year growth expectation is closer to 10%. ","Logix grew 6% in the quarter, the same as architecture and software as a whole. The Motion Control business within A&S experienced very strong growth reflecting continued success with OEM customers. ","We closed on two important acquisitions recently. vMonitor which brings wireless solutions for monitoring and controlling well head and upstream oil and gas applications; and Jacobs Automation which is a leader in intelligent track motion control technology for OEM machine builders. Both of these acquisitions bring intellectual capital and differentiated technology and we are excited to have them as part of our company. ","So to finish with this slide. Profitability was very strong in the quarter with adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%. I'll let Ted provide more details of our earnings in his remarks. ","I guess I want to mention one more thing before I leave the quarter. Control Magazine an industry leading publication exclusively dedicated to the global process automation market recently issued the results of this year\u2019s readers\u2019 choice survey. We had another very strong showing with 41 wins in control industry and product categories, the most of any process company. Of the six controlled discipline awards we won three with no other company winning more than one. This again reinforces the power of our differentiated multi-discipline logics control platform. ","In the industry awards we won 28 out of 53, the second place supplier won only 14. These results along with the diversity of applications we continue to win, reflect the breadth of our capabilities and domain expertise in process. We continue to gain ground as a leading DCS supplier. ","So let me give you our thoughts about fiscal 2014. From a macroeconomic perspective forecasts for GDP and industrial production are similar to what they were a quarter ago and call for increased growth as we proceed through the fiscal year. Global PMI has improved somewhat. And while most of our customers have not yet declared their CapEx plans our front log of opportunities is solid. ","Given this macro perspective and our results for the first quarter we are raising the lower end of our guidance. We now expect fiscal 2014 organic sales growth of 3% to 6% and adjusted EPS guidance of $6 to $6.35. Ted will provide more details about sales and earnings guidance in his remarks. ","Before I close I'd like to thank those of you who came to Houston to attend Automation Fair and our Investor Conference. We introduced integrated control and information which expands our served market and enables our customers realize their vision of a connected enterprise. We are confident that integrated control and information deepens our focus on innovation and domain expertise which enables us to provide attractive returns for our shareholders. ","So to wrap it up, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We are executing very well across the globe and I want to thank our employees, suppliers and partners for their dedication and expertise in continually expanding the value we provide to our customers. ","With that I'll turn it over to Ted. ","Theodore D. Crandall","","Thanks, Keith, good morning, everybody. My remarks will start with page five with our first quarter result summary. This was a good quarter with very healthy top line growth and strong earnings conversion. ","Revenue in the quarter was $1.592 billion, that's up 7% compared to compared to the first quarter of last year. The net impact of currency fluctuations and acquisitions was negligible. So organic growth was also 7%. Segment operating earnings were $328 million, up 19% compared to $276 million in Q1 last year. ","General corporate net expense was $21.7 million compared to $18.5 million in Q1 last year. That's pretty close to the expected full year run rate. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27.8%. That compares to an adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 last year of 26.6%. ","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.47, up 20% compared to $1.23 a year ago. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 140.4 million. During the quarter we repurchased approximately 1 million shares at a cost of about $111 million. And at the end of Q1 there was $424 million remaining under our $1 million share repurchase authorization. ","Moving to page six, this is the graphical version of total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide the year-over-year increase in sales for Q1 was 7%, sales declined 7% sequentially, a pretty normal result for Q1. ","On the right side of the chart you can see the year-over-year increase in operating earnings. Operating margin in Q1 was 20.6% that\u2019s a 2.1 point increase compared to Q1 last year and primarily reflects volume leverage on the 7% organic sales growth and just a modest increase in spending year-over-year. It\u2019s not unusual for increases in our spending to start off a bit slower in the beginning of the year and we expect spend to increase as we proceed through the balance of the year. ","Q1 operating earnings included $6 million of income related to a legal settlement in our Architecture and Software segment. This settlement increased operating margin in the quarter by four-tenths of a point. This was a follow on to the legal settlement income we talked about last quarter and we believe this is the final income we will recognize related to this matter. It's not displayed on the chart but our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.4%. ","Now let's turn to page seven which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture and Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart sales increase 6% year-over-year, organic growth was also 6%. Sales decreased 3% sequentially. Operating margin for the quarter was 30.4%, up 2.5 points compared to Q1 last year. The A&S margin benefited from higher sales as-well-as the aforementioned legal settlement. For the segment the legal settlement increased operating margin by nine-tenths of a point. ","The next page covers our Controlled Products and Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 8% compared to last year. Currency effects reduced sales in this segment by one point. So organization growth was 9%. The Solutions and Services portion of this segment grew by 10% and the product portion by 7%. Sales declined 11% sequentially with products down 2% sequentially and solutions and services down 16%. ","Book-to-bill for solutions and services was 1.1. We were pleased to see that above 1 but that's a little lower than normal for our first quarter. We did have a relatively strong growth in solutions and services sales but even with that we would have liked to have seen the book-to-bill more in the range of 1.15 to 1.2. ","Operating margin in Controlled Products and Solutions was 13% compared to 11.2% in Q1 last year, that's up 1.8 points. ","Turning to the next page, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter and Keith covered a lot of in his comments. I'll focus just a few comments on the far right column which displays organic growth. First I would reinforce a very strong performance in the U.S. with 10% growth. ","As Keith mentioned it was another strong performance in EMEA with sales up 5%. Growth was stronger in emerging markets in EMEA and it was another good quarter for growth with OEM customers. ","Asia Pacific was up 7% year-over-year also with strong results in emerging markets. China was up 21% and India returned to growth up to 13%, in both cases admittedly off easy comparisons. ","In Latin America growth was 3%. As Keith mentioned we continued to see strength in Mexico and Brazil, both with double-digit growth in the quarter. But we experienced sales declines in the Andean region primarily related to mining. We had a large mining project that hit in Q1 last year so a difficult comparison. And sales declined year-over-year in Argentina due to import restrictions. ","In Canada sales were down slightly compared to Q1 last year with growth in automotive and consumer more than offset by declines in mining and other heavy industries. ","I'll turn now to page 10 the free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million. That represents about 86% conversion on adjusted income. That's also a good start to the year. ","Turning to the final slide, page 11 summarizes our current outlook for fiscal '14. As Keith mentioned we've increased the lower end of our sales and EPS guidance range. We continue to expect sales to be approximately $6.6 billion. We now expect organic growth to be between 3% and 6% compared to the previous range of 2% to 6%. At the low end and mid-point of sales guidance we now expect slightly higher organic sales partially offset by increased currency headwinds. ","We believe that currency and acquisitions were about to offset for the full year but that net amount has gone from slightly positive in our previous guidance to now slightly negative. We continue to expect segment operating margins to be about 20%. The new adjusted EPS guidance range is $6 to $6.35. We now expect the full year adjusted tax rate to be between 26% to 27%. That's up from our previous guidance of 26%. ","The new adjusted EPS guidance range reflects the benefit of our somewhat higher organic sales, offset by unfavorable currency effects, slightly higher incentive compensation expense and a little higher tax rate. We don't provide quarterly guidance but as it relates to the second quarter and particularly as it relates to margins I would remind you that our annual merit increases kick in on January 1st and we do expect to ramp investment spending. We also will not have a reoccurrence of legal settlement income, so we don't expect operating margin in Q2 to be as high as it was in Q1. ","Last week there were significant currency movements, primarily in some emerging markets. The changes in those rates are not included in our new guidance and if those rates remain at current levels through the balance of the year that would create some additional currency headwind for us. ","We continue to expect free-cash flow conversion to be about 100% of adjusted income subject primarily to acquisition opportunities we still expect to spend about $440 million on repurchases this year. However we're now projecting that full year average shares outstanding will be about 140 million. That's up less than 1 million shares from what we expected in November and due to a higher share price. ","And finally we still expect general corporate net expense to be about $85 million for the full year. And with that I think we can move to Q&A. As we do so I would like to ask you that you limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up so that we can try to get to as many of you as possible today. Operator we can move to first question. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you sir. Our first question comes from Richard Eastman, Robert W. Baird. Please proceed. ","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, good morning. Just a question on the book-to-bill, you basically did flag the fact that it was maybe a little bit softer than you expected, still comfortably north of one. But I am curious if you can pinpoint any industries or perhaps geographies that you know maybe led just slightly less seasonal uptick and a book to bill.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yeah Rick I think where we saw a little bit weaker was primarily in our motor control businesses and we think probably more than any other industry a slowdown in mining is responsible for that.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Okay and then also just quick follow-up, the tone in the auto or transportation side of the business?","Keith D. Nosbusch","With the automotives we would say that it\u2019s basically hit out flat but remember this is at a very high level of investment. And I think we are starting to see mixed results with obviously Europe a little lower, as Ted mentioned automotive was strong in Canada and auto will remain strong in Latin America and it will probably flatten in the U.S. and remain flat in the U.S. and Asia is how we see the automotive at this point in time.","Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Theodore D. Crandall","","You are welcome Rick.","Operator","","Next question, Scott Davis, Barclays. Please proceed. ","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","","Good morning Keith and Ted. ","Theodore D. Crandall","","Good morning Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","","Couple of things, first I just wanted to get a little bit more color on China and India. I mean China has been a real rollercoaster. Is there any sense of stability there for you and any sense of increased predictability there going forward?","Theodore D. Crandall","Okay well let me start with the second part of that. The answer is no, unpredictability. I think you know I think China is going through the natural evolution from high growth to a more stable type of growth and I think they are going to see cyclicality or I should say isolations around that growth trend line. And so I would say we don't believe we\u2019ll have more predictability and we\u2019ll continue to see fluctuations. ","We certainly believe now that we\u2019re in a stable point in the China market and with the China economy but as you know they have a number of potential issues that continue to be concerning whether it be the credit availability or the shadow banking or the excess capacity with SOEs in some of the heavy industry. So they continue to work through those areas but I think we are at a stable part and exports appear to be reasonable at this point in time as well as investment in some of their consumer industries which is one of the areas that we\u2019re very focused on and the OEMs continue to perform well in China.","Keith D. Nosbusch","","Hey Scott maybe what I would add is in both China and India our sales quarter to quarter tend to be a little more variable because of project content and in the case of India the underlying orders were not as strong as the growth and I don't think we would stay there. We think we have turned the corner yet. And in China our expectations for the full year is still high single digit so we\u2019re not getting overly excited about 21% quarter.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","","Yeah it makes sense. Guys can we just talk quickly about oil and gas. And you know there is a lot of mixed feedback we\u2019re getting from companies you know, some notable big companies like Shell for example they cut CapEx recently. I mean are you seeing any slowdown in your front-log in that specific vertical?","Theodore D. Crandall","No, our front-log has remained pretty stable. I think what we need to be watching for with respect to your comment is are we starting to see projects being slowed pushed out and at this point in time we have been seeing that with the exception of Canada where they\u2019re in the middle of some very large project rollouts and it\u2019s just not the availability to work the next stage of projects at this point. So we see a little bit of a low in the order rate in Canada and certainly that's related to the previous heavy investments that were going into the oil sands. ","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital","Okay that's very helpful. Thanks guys and good luck.","Theodore D. Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Good morning everyone. ","Theodore D. Crandall","Good morning John. ","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Strength in the U.S. Keith and Ted do you have any sense may be if you could just give us a sense of how December played out and do you think there might have been any kind of the U.S. company say I don't want to use the term budget flush because I think that's a little too sensational but I think I've been spending maybe based on confidence just kind of what you are hearing from the channel what you saw in the United States to help drive the 10%?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well quite frankly December was very strong for us. And as far as on a year-over-year comparison it was the strongest month in the entire quarter. And quite candidly that's a comment worldwide not just the U.S. But that would lend to believe that there was some, that there was end of the year spending that was going on and I think that was a piece of it. Plus I think it was just the continued belief in an improving the economy and a little more confidence in that, after I would say during the summer timeframe, I think it was a little weaker in that regard. And so the combination of the end of the year and greater confidence probably led to a little higher spending as we exited the calendar year. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","John that said I would also say though that January has been pretty much what we expected. ","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Right. okay, so that makes economic sense. Some of your industrial peers are perhaps making a little bit more of mountain out of a molehill in terms of this weather issue. You guys see any of this, obviously weather has been pretty austere right, throughout the Midwest, Northeast. Have you seen any sort of an impact with respect to may be your flow goods business or anything that you would perceptively call out that maybe could have offset some of this budget spending? ","Theodore D. Crandall","No, at this point we have not seen order pattern aberrations based upon a very, either miserable day in the Midwest or East Coast or wherever it\u2019s occurred in different phases. So I think that has been a minimal impact for us and I wouldn't call that any different than what we normally see during let's just say a milder winter. ","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Okay. And then just may be lastly. Keith could you characterize sort of the state of China with respect to competition because clearly you have Japanese competitors that could be perhaps taking advantage of the yen. I think it's clear that China is improving right for lots of automation players which have done exceptionally well and I just want to sort of fixed up a little bit to Scott\u2019s question could you may be comment towards your confidence or the sustainability of improvement maybe north of 20%, given the backup really of what could be some advanced competition from either local players, Japanese players that sort of things. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","You are absolutely right there is no question China is a place that we see the Japanese competition more than any other region in the world. And they continue to be a very strong competitor. We believe that the portfolio that we have and the focus that we have in particular on OEMs and consumer industries that we're able to compete very effectively. ","I would say the other dimension of competitiveness or I should say competition is given that there is a slowing in particular some of the heavy industries, metals and cement in China, that those projects when they do come up are very, very competitive from a project and therefore solutions business. ","So I think we're seeing increased competitiveness simply because there is fewer projects in the heavy industries and you know that\u2019s not unusual and we think we can continue to win our fair share of those. But the fact of the matter is there are just not as many and that\u2019s why I made a comment earlier about some of the overcapacity, particularly in the SOE. ","The one exception to that would be China will continue to invest in oil and gas and they are continuing to invest in offshore projects and they\u2019re just at the start of determining whether or not they can create a shale industry. There\u2019s been recent reports that indicates they have shale reserves greater than the U.S. and the real question is how difficult is it to get to and they don't have the technology but will western technology be able to help them untap that. And I think that\u2019s a wild card down the road but I think that\u2019s the other potential play that we see in China going forward to offset the other heavy industry comments I made.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","And I am sorry, do you think you are positioned to capture that opportunity in oil and gas in China?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think if we look at what we\u2019re able to do in the U.S. in that space I think we have a good opportunity to compete effectively. Capture, I mean that\u2019s we\u2019ll see how it plays out. I think the bigger question is will China be able to tap that energy resource if they are I believe we will be able to compete effectively for projects just like we have in some of their offshore business and shale opportunities in the U.S. over the last couple of years.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Keith D. Nosbusch","You are welcome John.","Operator","","Our next question is from Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","","Hi good morning everyone. Just a few questions. Can you talk on auto, I know we\u2019re at a high level CapEx and your North American production is growth that we see slowing down but when you look at some of the investments being made by the transplant European base, Asian base transplants in Mexico and in other places, how much benefit do you get from that over the next couple of years? I know you\u2019re mix with the Detroit guys is pretty strong and very strong position there but how do you frame the opportunity with the other manufacturers over the next few years?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes well Mexico is the place where we will see continued investment to your point. There has been number of plants announced by both Asian and European as well as continued expansion of U.S. so let\u2019s take the Asian transplants. I would say that\u2019s probably the most difficult market for us because many times they work with their same partners they have in Japan and those tend to be the Japanese control manufacturers. So we can win pieces of that business but the heavy investment, particularly via what comes in on some of the OEM lines tend to be more Japanese brand. ","With respect to European competitors our toughest challenge there would be with BMW and Audi quite candidly. That will come in with Siemens equipment on but we can certainly compete for portions of the business even there, but also the other European transplants we have a much better opportunity to win those projects, and certainly we also believe with some of our expanding capabilities in power training now that we\u2019re in a better position to compete in that portion of the projects as well. ","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay that\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like Daimler and BMW are potential and you already have a good position there but there is opportunity to grow if they grow there.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes we do well with them in their transplants in the U.S. So Mexico is not that -- we think we can be consistent with our supporting capabilities in Mexico as we have demonstrated in their U.S. clients already.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. And then just two quick ones for Ted on Logix, I think 6% growth this quarter, is the outlook still on that high single digit growth rate for Logix in ' 14? And then the other piece of it is with the incremental being so strong this quarter it seems like the bias for the year that the incrementals are getting close to the 35, rather than 30 is that a fair statement?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So first on Logix, we would continue to expect for the full year that Logix would be somewhere above the average for Architecture and Software. So I would say higher single digits. In terms of the margins I think you are right on for the balance of the year. I mean we are not expecting, obviously the 20.6% is above our full year guidance for operating margin.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","All right. Okay, great. Thank you.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research","Hi. My first question just goes a little bit just more around that question of incremental margins and kind of investment spending. Can you give us a sense of just order of magnitude there and then what it's point at and can it play a role on the top line in the 2014 or is it more a kind of setting at 2015 and beyond?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yeah. So let me start at the back of that. I think clearly the investment spending that we put in place going forward now in the balance of the year will benefit us beyond 2014 and we should not expect to return in 2014. What we spend on is largely R&D and product development related, we have talked about in the past our focus on continuing to expand the Logix capabilities and also continued investment in our Intelligent Motor Control offering. ","In terms of ramp, I think what you should expect is the rate of growth in spending in the balance of the year is going to exceed our rate of growth in sales in the balance of the year.","Keith D. Nosbusch","And I would also just add to that, that we also will have an increase in spending due to the acquisitions that we just recently completed but they would add in the same categories that Ted mentioned but that's another incremental increase from a year-over-year standpoint.","Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research","Thank you for that. And then just I guess back to kind of the tone of business. Is there any change in kind of the nature of demand that you are seeing, you said there is a little bit of increased confidence to spend money but are we shifting from MRO or smaller projects to kind of greenfield or bigger expansions projects. Is there anything there to kind of spike up?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well that would depend on the region, Jeff. In the U.S., I would say we are not seeing large projects, the majority of the increases and front logs that we see at this time is continued small project and I will say expansion and productivity investments continued as opposed to what I would call greenfield.","If you go to Europe certainly the strength that we had in the emerging markets, that is all greenfield with respect to, I will call it, mature Europe, there we are seeing some greenfield investment in oil and gas. It may not be -- it may not end up in Europe, but the engineering and procurement occurs in Europe and a lot of that is offshore activities in oil and gas. And as we see the continuing investments at OEMs in Europe and a lot of that gets exported back into the U.S. and Asia and Latin America and so OEMs right in Europe.","And in Latin America we said that mining is down, but oil and gas continues to be strong in Latin America other than Mexico, the vast majority of that is greenfield investment. And in Mexico, a lot of it is just ongoing efforts to commoditize their existing equipment. ","Canada, I mentioned we did see the slowing in some of the major projects in oil and gas and mining in Canada. And I think that we had a very strong previous year in some of those heavy industry investments. And so there is a natural low before they can go forward.","And then Asia certainly we're seeing continued greenfield in the Southeast Asia region and in oil and gas in China. We're not seeing much greenfield in metals. As I mentioned there\u2019s very few projects there same for cement. But we are seeing greenfield in consumer industries particularly food and beverage, significant growth in there and so that would be a picture for you Jeff by region. ","Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research","Thanks, Keith that was good around the world run down actually. Then just finally Ted can you give us a little bit of color and I'll move, the currency do stay where they are at all year along what kind of headwind are you looking at?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yeah, so probably the three currencies that will make the most difference for us that were moving last week where Brazil, South Africa and Canada. If all of those stay where they are probably creates about a $20 million top line headwind. ","Jeffrey Sprague- Vertical Research","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Theodore D. Crandall","You are welcome. ","Operator","Next question Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. I just had a question on the December quarter on the operating margins. So I guess you and also your main European competitors both have very good margins in that fiscal Q1, they cited kind of software mix as a big boost. So I just wondered if that was true for you or if that was more just about fixed cost leverage because you had good organic growth? ","Theodore D. Crandall","Julian I think for us it's primarily about the organic growth and volume leverage. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay. There was nothing abnormal around mix in the quarter that you would call out? ","Theodore D. Crandall","No, I wouldn't say anything significant around mix. I mean obviously the margins are benefiting from that legal settlement that we talked about. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","We had good growth in solutions as we mentioned. So there really was to Ted\u2019s point no big mix difference here that created the margin expansion. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, and then my second question is just certainly it is little bit tiresome but circling back to kind of the U.S. automotive investment outlook, I just wanted to clarify what you had said earlier. I think you talked about U.S. being kind of flattish going forward. I just wondered if that was the status quo that you've had recently or if it's been pretty good and you expect it to flatten out from here?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well it has been pretty good. I mean as we talked last year automotive was one of the key drivers of our performance in the U.S. So we're expecting it to flatten out, slow a little from a very high level. So I think that's just the natural evolution of project spending in that industry and but we're still looking for continued opportunities and projects in automotive in the U.S. ","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, thank you.","Theodore D. Crandall","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning Ted and Keith. ","Theodore D. Crandall","Good morning, Steve. ","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","So I just wanted to be clear on the whole end market growth acceleration and deceleration, you've got 7% for the quarter last year and you're still guiding 3% to 6% for the year. So you're obviously looking at deceleration through the rest of the year and can you just again clarify a little bit more where you're expecting the most deceleration or headwinds to come from for the rest of the year that we should be planning in? ","Theodore D. Crandall","Sure. Well we think at the end of the year the U.S. will definitely be down from 10% growth quite frankly. And we expect the U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America to be slightly above the company average. And EMEA will be up for the year but below the company average but still we believe outperforming the market. And Canada will be slightly down year-over-year and that\u2019s basically how we come up with the 3% to 6% and I would say that basically my commentary taken it comments around the midpoint of our guidance range.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Keith here, Steve. I think also look there is some normal variability in our quarter-to-quarter sales and as you will remember I think first half last year for us is a pretty easy comparison in our solutions and services businesses because we came into the year with the hole in the backlog. So we expected coming into this year that we\u2019re going to see better growth in the first half than the second half. ","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then you guys are up to what looks like an all-time high on cash, I guess $1.25 billion and you have done couple of acquisitions. Could you maybe talk Keith to the strategic value of those? And then second Keith and Ted both maybe some thoughts around capital deployment as you go forward. It\u2019s been very consistent for Rockwell over the years. I am just wondering how you are thinking about that as that cash builds.","Keith D. Nosbusch","","Okay well let me talk about the acquisitions and we\u2019re very pleased with both of them and with vMonitor we think it\u2019s a great opportunity because it expands our technology and solutions, our reach and domain expertise in the oil and gas well head and really that gives us some differentiation with the integrated approach for the design in those systems and gives us additional capability in the production side, which is an area that we have been very strong and we can also continue to develop what\u2019s been called in the industry, a difficult oil field and this enables us to have a much broader solution for those requirements. ","So think of it as in the production side upstream and wellhead applications and those are quite frankly all over the world and we see a great opportunity in all geographies with that. ","With respect to Jacobs, Jacobs is a -- Jacobs Automation has really unique technology that we believe will provide faster speed and greater flexibility for machine builders. So it fits right into the OEM initiative that we have and the focus that we have been growing OEM sales on a global basis and really we see this as a way for customers to increase their productivity, help them reduce their energy consumption and really help them with speed of changeovers and therefore productivity that these OEMs can offer the end customers. ","So really a good fit with our motion capability and we\u2019ll continue to integrate that technology with our integrated architecture and that is a technology that will take some time to be absorbed in the OEM community but we think we have some good leading edge capabilities there. So that\u2019s a little commentary around the acquisition. I will let Ted comment on the other part of your question.","Theodore D. Crandall","","So Steve as it relates to cash deployment I mean I think I would characterize it as steady as she goes. I mean our commitment remains to exhaust our free cash flow after acquisitions either in dividend or share repurchase and we did that pretty much last year and our plan is to do that this year and that\u2019s reflected in $440 million of repurchases I talked about earlier. ","As it relates to the cash on the balance sheet we have talked about the issue there before of most of that cash being outside the U.S. and not having an easy way to repatriate without incurring significant tax liability. And I would say as it relates to that we have no plan to change that at the moment. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","","And just to reinforce the two comments is that the vMonitor acquisition the majority of that was made with cash outside the U.S.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thanks guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question is from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","","Hey good morning guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch","","Good morning Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey Ted great job filling in for Rondi. Doing a fantastic job.","Theodore D. Crandall","Thank you.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","On the oil and gas side I remember OTC last year I was talking to one of your guys and he talked about being offshore being a great growth driver for you guys and I think he said it was 50% of your -- I don't know whether he said it was 50% of your upstream oil and gas business. Could you maybe just provide some color on what the offshore market is as a percentage of your oil and gas sales? I know that you guys do a tremendous amount of high quality work on the BOP and stuff like that. So I am just curious as we kind of parse out Canada and stuff like that, this is getting a little more interesting, the percentage of business from offshore I guess is my key question?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yeah. Steve. I don't have that number right now. I think instead of just giving out one that I couldn't support long-term, we will get back to you with that one. I want to make sure we look at the information and have something there that we have confidence in the number. ","But certainly to your point we are very strong in the offshore both from a control as well as safety systems as the ICFT acquisition is very helpful there and we will have to pull together the make-up of our oil and gas business with respect to offshore and automobile as well and we will get back to you. ","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","And I guess it\u2019s mostly upstream and a little bit of midstream, is that kind of how we should think about the oil and gas?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, Steve. Absolutely right. When we talk about our process initiatives, what we are accounting there will be heavily weighted to upstream and midstream. So when we talk about motor control it would be across the board, upstream, midstream and downstream. Likewise safety systems would play across that entire continuum. But when we talk about our expansion in the oil and gas we are mainly talking about control and what we do with our solutions capability and the majority of that would be the production side. ","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","And then one last question just on\u2026","Theodore D. Crandall","We monitor this exactly in to that production side. ","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. So then just on the margin maybe just kind of a little bit different way and try and kind of understand what you guys were saying. So for the second quarter I guess a 35% incremental year-over-year or 30% to 40% kind of gets you to that high 19% kind of 20% range, if you will. I mean is that I am just trying to understand how this investment kind phases in and impacts that number. I mean is that kind of a way good way to think about kind of the step down from first quarter to the second quarter? ","Theodore D. Crandall","Yeah, I think it is. ","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. ","Theodore D. Crandall","Steve, what we expect is something in that 30% to 35% range in terms of conversion as compared to the 50% in Q1. ","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question coming from Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","Nigel, are you there?","Operator","Mr. Cole, please proceed, sir. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Hello. ","Keith D. Nosbusch","Hi, Nigel. ","Theodore D. Crandall","Hi, Nigel. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Can you hear me? ","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, we can now. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Good, good. So I guess I will ask the question again. So I just want to ask this way because you will always see this tick down in margins from Q1 to Q2, just a ramp up in spend and I know also because of the normalization impact effect. But did you say Ted that operating income or operating margin is down Q-over-Q? ","Theodore D. Crandall","Margin. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Margin, okay. I thought that\u2019s what you said. And then just on the, I just wanted to pick up on the trend about the book-to-bill for the quarter you mentioned again that it sounds like mining and Canada are the two factors there. But then Ted you mentioned the encouraging front-log activity. So I am just wondering, I am just trying to reconcile the two comments and I am wondering are you seeing this pickup in RFP activity through, do you see a pick-up in RFP activity through the quarter and going forward. The front-log activity suggests a pick-up in book-to-bill activity go through the year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well I think we wanted to characterize the front-log as stable at this point, not growing, but still solid as we look forward. And we would expect that to be starting to convert at normal rates as we go through the remainder of the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think Nigel, maybe what would help is I think I\u2019d say that our backlog and our front-log at this point is consistent with the guidance. ","","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Right, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Ted you mentioned about the yen currencies and obviously we are watching these with interest. You had an $11 million headwind I believe this quarter from currencies. And I am wondering is the impact on operating income, is it fairly linear, for the 15% -- for the 20% up in margin on that FX movement, would that equate to the impact of earnings or there\u2019s some unusual margin impact from currency?","Theodore D. Crandall","I would say as you would expect quarter-to-quarter it can be very variable. Over a longer period of time generally I would say the translation effect comes in on earnings, comes in pretty close to kind of our normal operating income percent. But in any quarter what drives variability tends to be re-measurement blockers or gains. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and was there any unusual impact last quarter from the currency moves?","Theodore D. Crandall","No, nothing significant in Q1. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks very much.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you, Nigel.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call over to Ted Crandall for closing remarks.","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, that concludes today\u2019s call. So thank you everybody for joining us and we will see you next quarter. ","Operator","Thank you, sir. Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day. "],"18910":["Rockwell Automation, Inc.

LLC","Operator","Thank you for holding and welcome to the Rockwell Automation quarterly conference call. I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions.","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our CFO.","Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Keith will also provide context around our outlook for fiscal 2016. Then Ted will provide more details on the results as well as our fiscal 2016 sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about one hour today.","Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to page three in the slide there.","Both sales and earnings came in below our expectations in the quarter. Organic sales declined a little over 2%. As we progressed through the quarter, conditions softened. And September was especially weak, particularly in the U.S. product businesses. We expected the U.S. to be up low single digits, and organic sales instead declined almost 3%. Remember that we have limited visibility in our product businesses, and September typically is the strongest month of the year. The shortfall in the U.S. was broad-based across verticals but particularly in oil and gas. China was the other weak spot. Sales in China were flat compared to the third quarter, but came in a bit lower than expected.","For the company, currency was an even larger headwind than we expected, reducing sales by 8% year over year. Overall, lower operating margin and lower sales led to the decline in adjusted EPS. Ted will elaborate more on Q4 financial performance, including the restructuring charges, in his remarks.","Obviously, the fourth quarter was a challenging end to the year, but I believe we executed well during 2015 in difficult market conditions. Here are some full-year highlights. We delivered modest organic growth despite significant headwinds from heavy industry end markets, including oil and gas. Process was down a bit in the quarter and flat for the year. We feel pretty good about those results given what other process players are reporting. Logix was up 4% for the year. That is about one point above Architecture & Software growth. For the quarter, Logix was flat.","Segment margin improved 120 basis points due to excellent execution, including particularly strong productivity in the Control Products & Solutions segment. EPS grew 4% in spite of 5% lower sales. And free cash flow conversion was excellent, resulting in record free cash flow of about $1.1 billion. Return on invested capital of almost 33% was also a fiscal year record.","We continued to return cash to shareholders, over $950 million during fiscal 2015. This was a 19% increase compared to fiscal 2014. And today we announced a 12% dividend increase, the seventh consecutive double-digit increase since the beginning of 2010.","These were good results in a difficult environment. I would like to thank our employees, partners, and suppliers for their continued commitment to serve our customers. Their dedication is key to our success.","Let's move on to the market conditions and economic indicators and what we expect to see in our business in fiscal 2016. We are experiencing weak market conditions as we enter the fiscal year. Heavy industry end markets, including oil and gas, have not stabilized, and we see continued softness in key emerging markets. Growth in automotive and consumer verticals globally will be insufficient to offset these headwinds.","In the U.S., the strong dollar is also affecting producers and equipment builders, and the broad-based slowing we experienced in September has persisted in October. We therefore expect a particularly weak start to the fiscal year. Current forecasts, however, call for continued global GDP and industrial production growth in 2016. And for the U.S., industrial production is expected to pick up after an anemic first half. That is why we are projecting gradual improvement, including year-over-year growth later in the year.","Taking all these factors into consideration, we are expecting fiscal 2016 organic sales to be flat to down 4% year over year. Including the impact of currency, we are initiating fiscal 2016 sales guidance of about $6 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $5.90 to $6.40. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over, I would like to remind you that we will be holding our main customer event, Automation Fair, next week in Chicago. As in prior years, we expect to welcome thousands of customers and partners from all over the world. We will showcase our latest technology and that of our partners. Attendees will take part in forums, technical sessions, and hands-on labs and network with peers to learn how to bring their connected enterprise to life, optimizing their business performance, and driving their competitive advantage.","I am particularly excited about this year's event. We are on track to have record attendance. And in fiscal 2015 and 2016, we will have launched an unprecedented number of new products, including our next-generation high-performance integrated control and information architecture. With this new offering, we will help our customers realize a step function change in productivity and global competitiveness. In short, we are enabling our customers to achieve their connected enterprise. Our innovation engine is really humming.","In closing, the prospects for Rockwell Automation continue to be very attractive. Even in the challenging market conditions we currently have, producers and equipment builders still need to have our technology and expertise as we help them achieve their business objectives. The long-term secular drivers for industrial automation and information remain intact. And we will continue to enhance our competitive differentiation in order to expand the value we provide our customers and gain market share.","With that, here's Ted.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on page four, the fourth quarter key financial information.","Sales in the quarter were $1.608 billion. That's down 9.8% compared to Q4 last year. This was the first quarter of fiscal year 2015 with an organic sales decline and coupled with the largest negative impact from currency of any quarter this year.","On an organic basis, sales declined 2.3%. We were expecting organic sales growth of about 1%. As Keith mentioned, that shortfall was driven primarily by lower sales in our product businesses and especially in the U.S. market. Currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 7.6%. That was a full point more than we expected at the beginning of the quarter.","Segment operating margin was 20.9%, down 1.3 points from Q4 last year. The lower margin year over year is primarily due to lower organic sales, unfavorable currency conversion, and $12 million of restructuring charges that we took in the quarter. We took the restructuring charges to get our cost structure more aligned to the outlook for fiscal year 2016 and to create some headroom to reallocate spending to our most important priorities in what we expect to be a difficult market environment.","General corporate net expense was $20 million in Q4 compared to $22 million a year ago.","Adjusted earnings per share was $1.57. We missed the midpoint of our guidance by $0.23. Unfavorable currency effects and higher restructuring charges accounted for half of that miss. Of course, lower organic sales also contributed to the miss. Adjusted EPS was down from $1.86 last year, primarily due to lower sales and margin, partly offset by lower share count. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 134.3 million, down 3% from Q4 last year.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 28.2%. That compares to 27% in the fourth quarter last year. Free cash flow for Q4 was very strong at $309 million.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $196 million. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 5.4 million shares at a cost of $606 million. That's almost 30% more than the $470 million in repurchases that we projected at the beginning of the year, and related to our strong cash flow performance. The rolling four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%.","Turning to page five, this is the full-year version of the key financial information. Sales were $6.308 billion for the full year, down 4.8%. Organic growth was 1.1%. Currency translation reduced sales by 6%. Segment operating margin for the full year was 21.6%. That's up 120 basis points from last year. The primary causative factors were the contribution from organic growth and strong productivity, which were partly offset by higher spending and unfavorable currency effects.","Adjusted EPS was $6.40. That's up 3.7% compared to last year despite the decline in reported sales. Free cash flow for the full year was $1.077 billion, which was 124% of adjusted income. The strong conversion was driven by very good working capital management through the year.","The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I'll start with the Architecture & Software segment on page six. On the left side of the chart, you'll see that Architecture & Software segment sales were $684 million in Q4. That's down 8.5% from the same quarter last year. The organic sales decline was 0.4%, and currency translation reduced sales by 8.1%.","Moving to the right side of the chart, in the fourth quarter, on the 8.5% decline in reported sales, Architecture & Software margins dropped by 3.8 points to 27.3%. A little less than half of the drop in operating margin is due to a higher than normal unfavorable currency conversion in the quarter. The balance is due to increased spending and the segment's share of the restructuring charges that I mentioned previously.","As we expected, spending was up significantly in the quarter in this segment both sequentially and year over year, and largely related to the timing of R&D project costs. The Q4 spending level in A&S is not indicative of an ongoing run rate. For the full year, A&S sales were down 3.4% as reported, with 3.1% organic growth. Segment operating margin for the full year was 29.4%, essentially flat compared to fiscal year 2014, with about one point headwind due to unfavorable currency effects.","On page seven, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment; in the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales declined by 10.7% year over year, with an organic sales decline of 3.6%. Currency translation reduced sales in this segment by 7.2%. The organic sales decline for product businesses in the segment was about 3%, and for solutions and services about 4%. The book-to-bill in Q4 for solutions and services was 0.83. That's about the same book-to-bill as Q4 last year.","CP&S has delivered very good operating margin performance this year, and that continued in the fourth quarter. Operating margin was 16.2%, up 40 basis points compared to last year. For the full year, CP&S sales were $3.558 billion, down 5.8% year over year and down 0.4% on an organic basis. On an organic basis, product sales in the segment were up about 3% for the full year, and solutions and services sales declined by about 2%.","CP&S segment operating margin for the full year was 15.5%, an increase of 190 basis points compared to 2014. This was a great result despite an almost 6% drop in reported sales and largely attributable to very strong productivity performance in the year.","Page eight provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and the full year. My comments will all refer to organic growth rates. As Keith mentioned, the U.S. was the biggest negative surprise in the quarter. Sales in the U.S. declined almost 3% compared to Q4 last year. Product sales declined about 4% year over year. Sales in the U.S. were flat sequentially. We expected sequential growth of 7%, which would have been more in line with historical norms.","Sales to customers in oil and gas in the U.S. were down year over year almost 30% in the fourth quarter and sequentially about 15%. We expected a sequential decline, but not quite this large. In the balance of the world, oil and gas sales were pretty much as we expected in the quarter.","There appears to be a general slowdown in U.S. industrial customer spending, both capital and operating spending. And what we experienced in the U.S. market in Q4 seems to be consistent with what we have seen reported by other automation-related and electrical suppliers, including some of the major distribution companies. Demand slowed through the quarter, as Keith mentioned, and September was especially weak, down about 10% compared to September last year. Demand levels in October and early November were down about the same amount. And consequently, we expect a very weak first quarter for sales in the U.S. For the full year, U.S. sales were up about 1%, with automotive as the best performing vertical.","Canada sales in Q4 were down just under 10%, but pretty much in line with our expectations for the quarter. For the full year, Canada was down 5%. Resource-based industries continue to be a drag on our Canadian business.","EMEA was up almost 4% organically in the quarter and up a little over 2% for the full year, with consumer-related industries as the best performing. The emerging countries of EMEA generated the higher growth rates in 2015, but mature Europe was up 1% for the full year. At the beginning of last year, we didn't expect that EMEA would exceed the U.S. growth result.","In Asia-Pacific, sales were down 10% year over year in Q4. India experienced modest growth in the quarter, but China was down high teens percent year over year. China was flat sequentially, but we expected to see some growth. For the full year, Asia-Pacific was down about 1%, with China down mid-single digit and low double-digit growth in India.","Latin America had another solid quarter at 5% growth, with strong growth in Mexico more than offsetting a decline in the balance of the region. For the full year, Latin America was up 9%, with Mexico growing in the high teens and Brazil about flat year over year.","Organic growth in emerging markets for the full year was 4%, led by Latin America and despite the decline in China, which is our largest emerging country.","And that takes us to the fiscal 2016 guidance slide. Based on demand levels as we exited September and that have continued through October and early November as well as our current backlogs in solutions and services businesses, we expect a very weak start to the year. We expect organic sales in Q1 to be down mid-single digit year over year, driven by the U.S. being down high single digit. With that starting point, even with projected IP [Industrial Production] growth next year, we don't expect sufficient sequential growth in the balance of 2016 to get us to a positive organic growth result for the year.","At current exchange rates, we expect a headwind from currency in Q1 similar to Q4. So on a reported basis, Q1 sales could be down over 10% year over year. For the full year, we expect currency to reduce sales by 300 basis points. Our projection for translation impact assumes recent exchange rates. For example, we're assuming an average euro rate of $1.09.","We expect fiscal 2016 sales to be approximately $6 billion. Organically, we expect sales to be down next year about 2% at the midpoint, with a range of minus 4% to flat for fiscal year 2015.","By region, on an organic basis, we expect U.S. and Asia-Pacific to decline a couple points more than the company average, and we expect to see growth in EMEA and Latin America. We think results will be relatively balanced across our products and solutions and services businesses, with product businesses declining at a little greater rate than solutions and services businesses in 2016.","We expect segment operating margin to be a little above 21%. That would be less than a 0.5 point decrease compared to 2015, with conversion margin of about 30% on the sales decline. We expect the full-year tax rate to be about 27%, equal to fiscal year 2015. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $5.90 to $6.40. At the midpoint of guidance, that represents a 4% reduction in adjusted EPS on 5% lower sales.","Q1 will be our most difficult year-over-year earnings comparison. We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%.","A couple of other items not shown here, general corporate net expense should be approximately $80 million in 2016. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 132 million for the full year. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. Keith already talked about today's dividend increase. The amount we spend on share repurchases in 2016 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But at this point, we expect to spend about $500 million on repurchases for the full fiscal year.","The next page includes an EPS walk from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. As you can see, currency is expected to be a significant headwind in 2016. As the benefit of currency hedges becomes smaller, currency conversion is more unfavorable year over year.","Core performance is down about $0.10. That represents about 15% earnings conversion on lower organic sales, which we think is a pretty good result. Modestly higher spending and a somewhat unfavorable mix is offset by strong productivity and a tailwind from lower incentive compensation.","As I mentioned on the previous slide, no significant impact from tax year over year. And finally, continued share repurchases are expected to provide a $0.20 or roughly 3% tailwind to EPS.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Patrick to begin the Q&A session.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we have quite a few callers in the queue today, and we would like to get to as many of you as possible. So please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. We appreciate your cooperation. Operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, UBS. Please proceed.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Keith, how do you reconcile or make sense of the record attendance at Automation Fair? It certainly seems like there's a lot of interest when you talk about all the innovative new products coming out, but yet contrasting that with the extremely weak trends here and seemingly a lack of willingness to invest. There's a lot of interest in the Automation Fair, but we're not seeing the spending. Explain a little bit what you're seeing in that contrast, and then just your confidence coming out of this.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Two things, the first would be Automation Fair, we believe with the theme of it being the connected enterprise and then, to your point, the dramatic increase in new products that are going to be introduced during the fair that we have a lot of excited customers about the opportunities to learn what is coming and how it can help them be more competitive. And there's no better time for our customers to focus on new technology than when their business is slowing and they have an opportunity to look at the new technology and integrate it into their strategies or their new machine lines as they come up. So we think this is a great opportunity.","The fact that it's in Chicago, it's always a well-attended fair. We think this year it will be even greater than the last time we were in Chicago, and that's because the Midwest is still the heart of manufacturing in the U.S. So we're excited to be there. We're excited with the messages that we will be providing our customers and, quite frankly, the confidence in the future. I think we have never been better positioned than we are today, and it's only going to get stronger. As I mentioned, this release of the new architecture, the next generation of that architecture and the ability to provide a broader portfolio of Rockwell Automation products and services and solutions is going to be unmatched in the both the industry and in the global environment.","So we're going to have customers there from around the world, Europe, Latin America, Asia-Pacific. That will also be a very strong showing. So you can see the interest that our customers have in basically continuing to drive their productivity and improve their competitiveness, and I think that's the message that has been out. We did a lot of pre-work to make sure that our customers knew all of the new products as well as something this year that we're going to have, the innovation demonstrations, where we talk about how the technology is going to evolve in the future and give them a snapshot of how that future is going to look three to five years down the road. So from a combination of new products, the innovations that are coming, and how technology is evolving to enable the connected enterprise, we think that's what's behind the attendance. And quite frankly, we're happy many of you will be there.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Shannon, your question about high attendance and low spending right now and that disconnect, what we're hoping it is indicative of is customers' expectations that despite low spending right now that they will be spending more sometime next year or sometime this year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then in terms of cash flow, a particularly strong year. I know you guys have been just working on productivity and working capital. Anything one-time in nature this year that you would call out, or is this just good cash execution?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think we really did have good working capital management this year. But in the interest of full disclosure, we also have some favorable timing items that we benefited from in 2015. I think we had some favorable cutoffs at the end of the year on receivables, and we also had some benefits in the timing of things like tax payments this year. So this was an exceptional year for cash flow generation. Some of that is going to reverse next year, I expect. But we're still expecting another good year in 2016.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Can we start with restructuring? You called it out, which you normally don't do. Could you parse it between CP&S and A&S? And then could you give us the total restructuring spend that would compare to the $12 million this quarter for fiscal 2015 and what would be embedded in your guidance for fiscal 2016?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","There's a lot there, so let me see if I can get all of that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's my long one question, first question, yes.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So $12 million in Q4 and about $20 million for the full year. We called it out because this was an unusually large amount for one quarter. We're expecting to generate about $25 million of savings in 2016 on that $12 million of restructuring spent in Q4, and that's reflected in our productivity expectations for next year. For next year in terms of restructuring charges, what we'll build into the plan is an amount that is similar to this year \u2013 or to 2015, I should say.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So about $20 million year over year, the same percent?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, and I'm sorry. In A&S and CP&S, it was roughly equal. The restructuring charges in Q4 were roughly equal between the two segments.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Given how quickly things have deteriorated, right, and you guys called out tough U.S. products business in September that spilled into October, we've got tough first quarter coming. I guess without being too specific, it sounds almost though that you're anticipating some sequential pickup, but not enough to get your EPS up year over year. But why would that be the case, meaning if this is the first period of serious U.S. decline, why do you think that next year for whatever reason that things are actually picking up because it really does look like that certainly on the heavier industry side, the global economy is getting worse, not better? So I just want to make sure I'm -- we all know how old Rockwell was very, very cyclical. Now you're more of a CPG company, but we're still trying to understand what's the expectation set for a company that obviously doesn't have a lot of visibility you're not baking in some false hope to the guide framework?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Right. First I would say, I was going \u2013 you just mentioned it -- I was going to start the answer by saying you know, we don't have great visibility. And I think your question is a legitimate question because there are concerns right now. There has been overall continued very slow global growth. We've got the slowdown in the U.S. in Q4 in industrial business. And if you look in the emerging markets, Brazil and China are still \u2013 we're not really seeing anything that is a near-term catalyst for improvement there. But as Keith mentioned, the forecasts for GDP and IP for 2016 are still indicating growth. Generally, our sales tend to track well with IP growth.","In the media and what we're hearing from business people and customers, people are not talking about the recent conditions in the U.S. as a general recession, although there has been some noise about maybe an industrial recession. In the U.S., the consumer side of the economy still seems to be in pretty good shape, including the most recent jobs report that was very positive. And we've generally thought that this should be a longer up cycle given the sluggish global growth. So it was all of those things that we took into account in looking at the outlook for 2016. And based on that, we're thinking this is more of a pause that will be followed by some sequential growth, not the beginning of a deeper downturn.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's fair. But on the other hand, we're going to get through the December quarter and roll into a new year. I guess what I'm trying to understand is, are you assuming things hold, Ted, at these levels and then pick up maybe beyond the March quarter, or do you assume that things are going to actually start to begin to sequentially improve post the December quarter, I guess, is the question.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No, I would say generally we're not expecting to see sequential growth until the second half of the year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, so first half tougher and sequential growth second half. Got it. Okay, thank you.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","You're welcome. Thank you, John.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you just tell us? I guess the software business outside of embedded and the stuff that goes along with the products, but just your more \u2013 like the MES [Manufacturing Execution Systems] type of stuff, what that did in the quarter, and then ultimately what that did for the year as well?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. We had a very good quarter in our IS Solutions business, which is Information Software, in the quarter. We had a high for the year of sales. It was up above the average for the company. We also had very strong margin and OE performance in the business as well.","We continue to expand the pilot programs with rollouts at multiple customers now. We currently have over 100 customers running FactoryTalk Production Center, and we have the suites installed in over 200 plants. And so this continues to be an area that now we are looking at growing it more aggressively. It's at the forefront of the connected enterprise and what we can do for customers in the IT\/OT convergence that is currently going on. And quite frankly, after a number of years, this is the best that that business has been positioned with the suites that they have as well as the ability to deliver both revenue growth and profit growth at the same time. So that team has done a very good job there. And we think as we continue to build upon the connected enterprise story and vision that our software business will play a more important role going forward.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sorry, so it did grow, just to be clear. And then just lastly as a follow-up, because your sales were down, so I would assume that it grew above when you say above the company average. And then lastly, just in Mexico, what's growing so strongly there? Is that still oil and gas that's holding up, or is that auto? And then maybe at a higher level, what are your comments on global auto? And that's it.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay. Yes, it did grow and it has grown for the year, our software business.","Mexico is a very broad-based story from the standpoint of what's growing. Obviously, the strongest growth there has been oil and gas, and it has been for us. And we continue to win more midstream projects in oil and gas. The areas, automotive continues to grow, and we expect that to continue into next year. The ability of \u2013 the powertrain capabilities that we have will open new opportunities for us there. We also have great channel capabilities in Mexico, and we're starting to see the power of our distribution model as it continues to mature. And in your emerging markets, Mexico is probably the most mature distribution capability that we have.","And so it's brought across verticals. Consumer was very good. OEMs grew tremendously this past year, mainly because of the mid-range capabilities that we have. And so we see the oil and gas, consumer industries, automotive, and the channel work that is going on in OEMs being the areas that is driving growth for us, and we do expect that to continue as we go into 2016, not at as high a level as it grew in 2015, but still the best emerging market performance of the larger countries for us next year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for the color, Keith. I appreciate it.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","No problem, Steve. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research. Please proceed.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning, just a couple other subtopics here. Keith or Ted, could you elaborate a little bit more on just how this abrupt deceleration unfolded? And by that, I mean does it look like it's inventory liquidation? You mentioned MRO. Was there a more abrupt pullback in MRO? Is there is any common theme to what you saw happen? I'm asking the question in the context of trying to understand how we do consider stabilization at some point.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So, Jeff, my comments are going to \u2013 this is Ted. My comments will reference the U.S. July was a little bit below where we thought it would be. Things picked up a little bit in August and then deteriorated significantly in September, and September got worse as the month progressed.","You know as it relates to inventory that generally our end users and OEMs don't keep a lot of inventory of our stuff, and we have very good visibility in North America of the channel inventories. There has been no significant change in channel inventory, so we don't think this is about destocking. I think what we believe is what we have seen here, it has been \u2013 in the U.S. this year it's been generally a lower number of larger projects. But what we saw in the fourth quarter and particularly September looks like a turn down in both MRO and small project spending. And that's why in my comments I suggest that we think this is both capital spending and operating spending.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","And that's why I think the product business is more because that is what drives obviously the MRO. But also small projects tend to be much more product-centric.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And what's going on with price? Have you seen degradation in price and anything from your foreign domiciled competitors that are disruptive on price?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","So in terms of our price realization in Q4 and the full year, it was right at about one point, maybe even a little bit better than that. I'd say this year has been a little bit better than average, so pretty much as we expected. I think it would be fair to say we haven't seen any significant change in competitor pricing dynamics. But the U.S. dollar being as strong as it is, is not helpful and thus put increased pricing pressure on us.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And are you seeing a reciprocal positive effect on the European OEM machine builders? Obviously, your share and exposure in the U.S. would be higher, so I wouldn't expect a like-for-like offset. But can you tangibly see and feel U.S. OEM machine builders losing share globally and it being picked up in Europe and other places?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think that is the way the global OEM market operates. It does move \u2013 not with every quick change in currency, but this has been relatively long now. And you are seeing the competitiveness of Europeans increasing. I think we see their attention being turned more to the U.S. because of that. And also, we're seeing because Asia is weaker, China is weaker, there is less European exports to China and to Russia. So I think they're looking at the U.S. as the opportunity to make up for that other decline. And to Ted's point, the currency is giving them a competitive advantage in that regard.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you for the color.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","You're welcome, Jeff. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, Keith and Ted.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Ted, I guess I just want to run through the bridge. The top line feels reasonable. I mean who knows, but it looks reasonable. But the decrementals on core sales feel a bit light. And I understand there's some restructuring payback, but 15% given what you've done in the past and given the expectation of products is going to be worse than the average, how do you control decrementals in this kind of environment?","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think it's a couple of things. There is some spending increase, but it's pretty modest year over year. And then probably the most important thing is we're expecting another strong year for productivity, similar to what we generated in 2015, and that should be helped by the restructuring charges that we took. And then equally important is there's going to be some tailwind from incentive compensation with lower sales and lower EPS year over year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, okay. And then, Keith, you mentioned your short cycle, it's tough to get a handle on your 2016 trends, but you've seen a lot of down cycles. And I think we tend to agree with you this is more of pause than something more sinister. But drawing on your experience from prior downturns, what gives you confidence, be it from what you've seen in the channel or be it from customer conversations, what gives you the confidence that this isn't a bit more of a severe downturn?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","I think it goes back to some of the comments that Ted made why we're going to see a very difficult first half to the year. We're still looking at the key indicators for us, which is industrial production. And that's still forecast to grow in 2016 and to grow at a faster rate later in the year. So that historically has been a very good indicator of our performance. And I also think some of our new products, we do expect next year to be able to take market share. So that is always a piece of our equation. I think that's how we look at our ability to demonstrate differentiation. And certainly, with our new technology and our new products, we expect as the year unfolds to be able to take share, even in a difficult market environment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Thank you, Nigel.","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Hi, Rich.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Keith, on your last comment there around market share, where do you \u2013 I assume that's a global comment in terms of taking share. Is it the usual suspects in terms of taking share in process, or are there other areas that you expect to drive share gain?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes, that is the main one. But I would say in addition to that, we think we can continue to grow our share in safety. We think we can continue to grow our share in our power control businesses, both in what I would call our drives business and our intelligent motor control center business with some of the some new capabilities that they are building out.","And then as we've talked previously, we are starting to quote and be involved in more activity in powertrain. And we see that as an opportunity that's going to expand for us this next year, and we expect to be able to create some more wins there. And that's an area, as all of you know, we historically did not participate greatly in. So that would be the other one that I would add to the pile in addition to process.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you give us some framework for how you're thinking about the various verticals that you're tied to, oil and gas, auto, consumer, food and bev, et cetera, in terms of what's embedded in the outlook? And then second, what's your assumption for the China auto business in 2016? What's embedded in the outlook?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Okay, let me start with the last one. We think China in automotive will probably be down on a year-over-year basis. That has been a growing piece for us previously, but we have seen some slowdown in the automotive market there with the decline in sales of autos, the front end of autos.","With respect to the outlook in the different industries for us, auto, we expect that to grow above the company average and, as I mentioned, increased opportunities in powertrain. Tire is expected to grow above the company average. We've been talking recently about the weakness in the China OEMs. That is going to continue to be true, but there have been eight greenfield plant announcements in the U.S. and Mexico, primarily with Asian manufacturers. And we're very well situated in those expansions. So we see that as a growth.","Food and beverage, we think that will be flat next year. With North America, the focus is on modernization and productivity. And in Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific, we expect to get the traditional different variety and packaging changes that will drive growth there for us.","In home and personal care, we expect that to grow about the company average. And there, new product introductions and innovation is driving a lot of that. Life Sciences we expect to be above-average growth for us, and that will be driven by the new requirements, including serialization.","If we look at some of the heavy industries, there we expect that oil and gas will be weaker in the U.S. for sure and especially in the first half of the year, but we do expect Latin America to be a little bit. Overall, oil and gas will be down about 10% next year. And then some of the small \u2013 excuse me. First, mining will continue to be weak across all regions, with the commodity prices continuing to be down. And also you're seeing a lot of restructuring in the larger global customers, and that tends to slow CapEx spending while that's going on.","In some of the smaller verticals, pulp and paper, we think it will be in line with the company average. There is spending going on in the U.S. and Canada for modernization. Metals continuing to be weak and soft, and just a couple of large projects that we'll be participating in in EMEA and Asia-Pacific but overall weak. Chemicals, about the company average, and obviously everyone knows what's going on there with the lower feedstock prices driving additional expansion and modernization in that industry, particularly along the Gulf Coast.","So that's a quick overview of all the key verticals and how we're thinking about them next year.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I appreciate it. Thanks, Keith, for that.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron, CLSA. Please proceed.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks, good morning.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Following up on the oil and gas markets, it sounds like came in below your expectations in the quarter. Can you talk about what you're seeing there and maybe dig a little deeper into your comment about that market being down another 10% next year? How do you see that unfolding, and where do you see a bottom there?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Well, I think at this point, we haven't seen the stabilization or the bottom. We were a little surprised with the drop in the U.S. this last quarter. The rest of the world operated pretty much as we expected, but the U.S. was stronger decline, which is why we're believing we haven't gotten to stabilization yet. We'll learn a lot more in the first calendar quarter as all of the key companies release their capital spending. But as you've seen with some of the recent releases, they're expecting that to continue to be reduced in the next year, in some cases as high as 20% to 30% reduction.","So we're not expecting capital spending to be strong. We do believe that they will continue to spend on driving down their operating costs. We believe we have some new technology that we'll also be talking about at Automation Fair that enables us to create a much more productive oilfield as well as the ability to create more of helping them maintain their assets, their rotating equipment, which is very important in that industry with some capabilities in remote monitoring and in asset management capabilities of that equipment.","So we think in some of the smaller countries, they will continue to create opportunities for us to help them become more productive so they can compete better against some of the majors. So the Latin America countries, in particular, Southeast Asia, we'll see some benefits there. But overall, it's going to be another declining year of capital spending in that industry in 2016. So that's why we're cautious about how we're approaching this because we don't believe we've seen the bottom.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Jeremie, I think the other thing coloring our view of oil and gas in 2016 is particularly in our solutions businesses, we're going end of the year with a weaker backlog, and our front-logs would indicate that we're going to see continued declines.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay; that's helpful. Then maybe quickly on EMEA, obviously pretty robust performance there. I wonder how much of that is due to your machine OEM clients, where I think you've made good progress over the recent years.","And just a quick one for you, Ted, on pension, you haven't made any comments on that. Just a view on expenses around this and funding. Thanks.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Yes. Certainly, Europe, the best part of our success story there is the continued expansion into the OEM space. We continue to expand the number of customers that we have, and we continue to expand the breadth of our portfolio to where it's more than just a motion on the machines. We're growing our safety business there and we're growing our network sensor business there in addition to our standard drives. So we do see the OEM business in Europe as one of the areas that has been responsible for our continued growth, even in a very difficult environment.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Jeremie, this is Ted. I didn't mention pension because it's a pretty modest change 2015 to 2016. On an operating cost basis, it's less than $5 million, and the full-in GAAP pension expense increase year over year is about $15 million.","Patrick Goris - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And your last question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, guys, for fitting me in. Just first on the cost side, in terms of the $20 million of restructuring for next year and given the lack of visibility to increased technology spending and the productivity that's no doubt freeing up capacity, why stop there? Is that just a placeholder? Do you have the project pipeline? How quickly might you increase that if conditions I guess worsen, or how are you thinking about the relative size? We're just seeing maybe larger programs at many of the other companies.","Theodore D. Crandall - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","Steve, I think we believe that the restructuring charges that we took at the end, across 2015, and particularly in the fourth quarter should be reasonably sufficient to get our cost structure adjusted to what the current outlook is. There in any year we've always got some normal level of restructuring charges, which I would say typically is about $10 million a year. We left an extra $10 million in 2016 because of the uncertainty around the outlook right now. And so if things play out the way our current guidance indicates, we think our cost structure is in pretty good shape. If things get a little bit worse, we will probably be looking at taking more restructuring actions.","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","But as we have often said, the areas that we're very careful and cautious about is, as an intellectual capital business, we have to continue to invest in new technology. I mentioned a lot of new products coming out. We want to finish those. And we also need to make sure that our customer-facing resources stay as strong as possible because that's how we're going to get the interest level at our customers with our capabilities. So it does require expense spending to do that. It's all about people. And those are the areas that we want to maintain as high of a capacity as possible for the reasons that we do see this as short term in nature. And we are building our capabilities and our product and service portfolio for the long term for our customers.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, fair comment. And then just on process growth, obviously very, very difficult end markets, but still second year of I guess 4% or below growth in the area, better than apparently with the peers with some of the competitor moves. But maybe just comment on the rate of deceleration in process. And as you look forward, given all the new product introductions and all the effort, are some of the competitors closing the gap as you see them or getting more aggressive in that area, or do you attribute the process growth \u2013 or slower growth all of it to the markets?","Keith D. Nosbusch - Rockwell Automation, Inc.","The simple answer is we are putting it all on the market at this point in time. We believe, to your earlier part of the question, know that some of the new capabilities that we're going to come out in the batch hybrid space will create additional opportunities for us. And as I mentioned, we have some strong capabilities now in the oil and gas space that we believe will also help drive productivity as opposed to just looking at increased production levels and new wells. We think we have an opportunity to help customers reduce their operating costs, improve their competitiveness with the lower oil prices. That's very important, and it's something that they're very interested in as opposed to just expanding the production rates themselves.","And so we think there are a couple of things in here that allow us to still be very focused. We've improved some of our go-to-market strategies in the industry with some project pursuit capabilities. And so we continue to add capabilities to our platforms. So I wouldn't say people are catching up with the multi-discipline control. And I would say we're continuing to remove any of the shortcomings against some of the pure DCS players with our modern DCS approach. So we have a lot of expectations for our ability to continue to grow in process.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, guys. Thanks, see you next week.","Keith D.

(Operator Instructions)","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle ","Thank you Annette. Good morning everyone. Apologize for the delay at the beginning of this call. We had some technical difficulties. I believe they are resolved now and we can proceed. So thank you for your patience on that. Also thanks for joining us Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.","With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall our Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights of the Company's performance in the third quarter and year-to-date plus our outlook for the remainder of the year. And then Ted, as always will provide more details on all of that and we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand it over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone. I know it\u2019s been a busy earnings season for all you so I appreciate your time today. I hope you all get to enjoy some downtime later in August.","The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter. So please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck. Sales and earnings came in as we expected this quarter. Organic sales grew 2% year-over-year. We experienced strong 7% growth in Architecture & Software but a difficult comparison in our Solutions & Services businesses led to a 2% sales decline in Control Products & Solutions.","More importantly, we saw sequential growth in both segments and across all regions except EMEA which had a 1% sequential decline. This sequential growth reinforces our view of continued economic growth. Let me give you a little more color by region and by vertical. All of the growth rates I mentioned will be for year-over-year for organic growth.","Sales growth in the U.S. remains solid at 5%. We continue to see broad-based industry performance with strength in oil and gas, particularly in shale. In Canada, sales were down 8% with a significant decline in Solutions & Services. We are still seeing weaknesses in resource-based industries; however, the product businesses grew nicely.","In EMEA, sales growth of 1% was lower than growth in the first half, again, mostly due to the variability in our Solutions businesses. OEM sales remained healthy. Sales in Asia Pacific were flat because of the large sequential sales increase in last year's Q3. As expected, China sales were down 5% year-over-year, but up mid-teens sequentially.","We're starting to see an increase in consumer packaged goods manufacturing investment in China, particularly in brewing and dairy. And as you know, consumer goods is a sweet spot for us. Latin America was flat year over year due to a very difficult comparison as the region grew 23% last year.","Mexico sales were flat and Brazil sales were down this quarter, but we expect to see a return to double-digit year-over-year growth in both countries next quarter. Logix was up 7% in the quarter. We continue to see good adoption of our midrange controllers with OEMs.","Before I end my comments on top line, let me share a couple of other data points. Our Motion Control business was up double digits in the quarter which is another indication of success with OEMs. Process grew 6% in the quarter. For the full year we now expect process growth to be in the mid single-digit. This is below our previous projection, primarily due to project timing.","I'll just touch on earnings in the quarter, because Ted will cover the details. On 2% sales growth in the quarter we were pleased with both year-over-year and sequential operating margin expansion, and free cash flow in the quarter was very strong at 131% of net income. Looking at the year-to-date results on organic sales growth of 5%, we've expanded segment operating margin by 70 basis points.","Adjusted EPS is up 6% for the year and would have been higher without the significant headwind from a higher tax rate. Delivering these results while still funding investment spending is a testament to the viability and solid execution of our growth and performance strategy.","So onto the outlook. With three quarters behind us, we've narrowed the range of organic growth guidance to 4% to 6%. We continue to expect underlying market growth. On the revised sales growth, we've also narrowed the adjusted EPS range to $6.10 to $6.25. The midpoints of both ranges remain the same.","Ted will go into more detail on guidance. Before handing it off to Ted, I would like to remind you that Automation Fair is in Anaheim this year, and we'll be holding our investor conference on Thursday, November 20, one week later than last year. Although Automation Fair is a customer event, it's a great opportunity for investors and analysts to deepen their understanding of Automation and learn more about our capabilities as well as those of our partners.","This year, our focus will be on the connected enterprise, and how Integrated Control and Information, we also refer to this as ICI, can help our customers become smarter, more productive and more secure. ICI enables us to expand the value we provide to our customers, which results in superior returns for our shareholders. So please mark your calendars and we hope to see many of you there.","In closing, I want to thank our employees and partners for their ongoing commitment to our Company's success and to our customers' success. I appreciate and I know our customers appreciate the passion, innovation and integrity and excellence that is evident in how we do business everyday.","Here is Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. Ted.","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks Keith. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with Chart 4, which is the third-quarter results summary. So a pretty straightforward quarter, slower growth, pretty much as we anticipated against what was our most difficult year-over-year comparison quarter. Earnings were also inline with our expectations. Revenue in the quarter was $1,650 million, up 2% compared to the third quarter of last year. Organic growth was also 2%.","Segment operating earnings in the current period were $326 million, up 3% compared Q3 last year. General corporate net was $18.1 million in Q3 compared to $20.9 million in the same period last year. The adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.6% compared to an adjusted effective tax rate in the same period last year of 22%. In Q3 last year, we benefited from a large favorable discrete tax item.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49 that compares to $1.54 in the same quarter last year. The higher tax rate reduced adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 139.6 million. We repurchased approximately 1 million shares in the third quarter at a cost of about $122 million. At the end of Q3, there was $191 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization from 2012 and the Board approved an additional 1 billion repurchase authorization on June 4.","Through the first nine months of the fiscal year, we've repurchased 2.9 million shares for approximately $344 million, so we\u2019re running a little ahead of the pace to hit the $440 million full year repurchase expectation that we talked about on previous earnings calls. With only one quarter left in the fiscal year, it's likely that we will spend more than the $440 million that we previously projected.","Moving to Chart 5. This is the graphical version of total Company results for the third quarter. As I mentioned, year-over-year sales growth was 2%, sales increased 3% sequentially that\u2019s a more typical Q2 to Q3 sequential increase. Last year the sequential increase form Q2 to Q3 was 7%, primarily driven by the Solutions & Service businesses that experienced an 11% sequential increase.","Total segment operating margin in Q3 was 19.8%, up 20 basis points compared to last year a modest improvement that's in line with the 2% sales growth. Higher sales and favorable mix were partially offset by increased spending. While on the chart, our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 29.6 at the end of the third quarter.","Now please turn to Chart 6 which summarizes the third quarter results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales reached $715 million up 7% year-over-year as reported and organically. Sales increased 4% sequentially, so we have seen continued strong revenue performance in the segment. Operating earnings increased 9% year-over-year and the segment operating margins for the quarter was 28.6% that\u2019s an increase of 50 basis points compared to Q3 last year. 7% organic growth provided considerable volume leverage, which more than offset the effect of increased spending.","The next page, Chart 7, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Compared to Q3 last year, sales were down 2% as reported and organically. The Product businesses grew 2% year-over-year and Solutions & Service businesses declined by 4%. As I mentioned Q3 was a particularly difficult year-over-year comparison for the Solutions & Services businesses.","Sales for the segment increased 2% sequentially, with the Product businesses and Solutions & Service businesses, both up about the same. Book-to-bill for Solutions & Service businesses 1.06 in Q3, on the right side of this chart, you will note that operating earnings were a little lower than last year and operating margin declined by 60 basis points year-over-year primarily due to the lower sales.","The next chart is the geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter and year-to-date. Keith covered the regional performance in the quarter, so I'll just make a couple of comments on the year-to-date results. It's been pretty well-balanced growth through the first nine months, with growth in every region with the exception of Canada. Canada is the region with the largest percentage of sales in Solutions & Services and the slow down in the oil sands that we've talked about on previous earnings calls has had a significant negative impact on the year-over-year performance.","Clearly, the U.S. continued to be our best-performing region was 7% organic growth through the first nine months, EMEA is up 3% year-to-date. We continue to do well with OEM customers. Asia-Pacific is up 5% year-over-year through June with China up 8%. And Latin America is up 4% with Brazil and Mexico both up about 8% through the first nine months. Generally the year-to-date growth rates by region are pretty much what we\u2019re expecting to see for the full year.","I\u2019ll turn that Chart 9, which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $274 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is about a 106%. Given the year-to-date performance we will probably finish the year somewhat better than the previously projected conversion of about 100%.","Turning to the next chart, this provides an EPS walk from the first nine months of last year to the same period this year. Looking at the bridge, adjusted EPS was up 6%, increasing from $4.09 to $4.32. That\u2019s on organic sales growth for the first nine months of 5%. The 6% adjusted EPS growth despite a pretty significant headwind from tax rate, which you can see here as worth about $0.22. Excluding the effect of the higher tax rate, the adjusted EPS growth would have been about a 11%. Segment earnings were up 9% with incremental margin of about 38% in the first nine months.","And that takes us to the final slide, Chart 11, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal 2014. As Keith mentioned, we've narrowed our sales and earnings guidance but maintain the previous midpoints. We expect sales to be about $6.64 billion at the midpoint. We expect organic growth for the full year of about 4% to 6% you can think of that is plus or minus about $50 million around the midpoint.","We expect the net impact of currency and acquisitions to reduce sales by about 50 basis points. We expect segment margin for the full year to be a little above 20%. We are projecting adjusted EPS in the range of $6.10 to $6.25. We now expect the adjusted tax rate for the full year to be closer to 27.5%. Previously, we expected to realize a discrete tax benefit in Q4 that we now believe we will not occur to next fiscal year. And finally, we expect general corporate net expense to be about $80 million for the full year that\u2019s about $5 million lower than our previous guidance.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks Ted. Before we start Q&A, I'd just like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and this will allow us to get to as many callers and questions as possible. So we appreciate your cooperation and Annette, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you (Operator Instructions) Okay and the first question come from the line of John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead and ask your question.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning John.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Good morning John.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Good morning. What was the impact, if you could quantify it, please, of year-over-year and sequential spending in the quarter? And how does that sort of play out in the fourth quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, so spending was up about $26 million year-over-year, which is about 6% and it was up about $6 million sequentially, which was about 1% sequential increase. And in the fourth quarter we do not expect any significant sequential increase.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","And preliminarily, Keith and Ted, how are you thinking about sort of investment spending against the backdrop? And I admit, I realize you have comparison issues, but the macro isn't exactly rocking and rolling, no pun intended. So how are you thinking about sort of this investment spending, given that we're sort of one quarter away or less than one quarter away, from your fiscal year next year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well as far as spending for next year, we haven't done any preparation yet for the annual plan at this point. But we certainly have put in additional incremental spending this past year. And we are very pleased with that. We put it in areas that are going to help us mid and long-term in both product development and in the R&D areas and then also in customer facing resources in different regions.","So right now we are happy with that investment spending, you saw continued margin improvement in ANS where a lot of that spending has been put and we certainly feel that that will pay dividends down the road and we are pleased that we were able to start spending earlier this year than we have in the past year so very pleased with those investments and we expect them to pay off in the long run.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","I guess what I'm trying to understand, Keith, is: The degree to which the spending was concurrent with, say, capacity or sales resourcing versus forward. In other words, the spending we've made this year, does that give you a lot more runway for next year? That\u2019s really all I am trying to understand.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, if the runway means that we won't increase spending again, I think that will be dependent upon what we think the revenue performance will be next year. We certainly believe that our spending does not correlate directly to quarter-by-quarter of performance and as we've said our spending is really in anticipation of six to eight quarters out which is new product development time as well as new customer ramp-up time to full productivity. So we hope quite frankly we hope we can continue to increase spending next year in development and in customer facing resources and if the revenue projections continue to enable that, we certainly have more opportunities in our businesses to invest in.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","That's fair. And then just as a follow-up, what is your frontlog telling you? And obviously, this earnings season has been characterized by pretty slow organic growth. How are you guys thinking about maybe the cycle and this notion perhaps the cycle has peaked for automation investment in terms of, say, North America, rest of world?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Our frontlog has remained stable over the quarter, and and it's been at a good level throughout the year. So we did not see a meaningful change in the frontlog this past quarter. So we think it's still pretty viable and certainly is what we are viewing as why we are expecting higher year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. So it's our frontlog, we built our backlog last quarter. So we think those are both good indicators why we are able to continue to expect the high, I'm sorry not high, higher year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks very much.","Keith D. Nosbusch","You\u2019re welcome, John thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next line of question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you operator. Good morning guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning Scott.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","I'm trying to figure out a little bit of how much resource-related stuff, and mining, in particular, impacted your non-U.S. business, because the extent of deceleration was a little bit surprising outside of the U.S. And I'm just trying to understand, is there something broader than resource and mining, or is it just a fairly big impact from that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. I think there's two things, Scott. Certainly mining, if you look at Latin America, and you look at South Africa in the EMEA region and in Australia, in our Asia-Pacific region Australia, China, and to some degree Canada quite frankly would also be impacted. That's one of the reasons why you've seen the decline year-over-year in our Solutions & Services business with a lot of it coming from really our motor control both medium voltage and motor control centers.","So that's one area and I would say probably a significant part of the declined this quarter is because of those businesses in the mining industry. The second is just some project timing. And you know we\u2019ve talked about this all the time that it is hard to look at exactly how projects come in and go out on a quarter-by-quarter basis in a comparison year-over-year and quite frankly last year was a very, very strong shipment quarter and this year some projects slipped out and it was a little lighter in general. We knew it was going to be lighter which is why we mentioned that in the last quarter.","But also at the end of the quarter a few things slipped into Q4. So its really those two dynamics that we are going on that we really think is what is behind the solutions and performance minus 4% in the quarter.","Theodore D. Crandall","I think to your point Scott we view what you are referred to as deceleration of more as kind of a project timing issue than an underlying market conditions issue. We had some tailwind from project timing in the first half and we've got some headwinds now.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","That's really helpful. Guys, just \u2013 and I'm asking you to take how your crystal ball. I know it's hard in the businesses you're in, but Canada was a bit surprising. We talked about resource industries we know, but some lot of \u2013 of your peers have seen a snapback in Canada this quarter, and a better order book for next quarter. Do you have a sense of when that business flat lines out and starts to improve again, or at least, are we at a, what I'll call, a cycle low at this point? If sense of that.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I mean given that its project Canada is a very heavily project oriented region for us. It's very hard to say exactly when we are at the bottom or not, but we do I mean specific to your question we do expect sequential growth in the low single-digits about 4% in Canada in our fourth quarter. So if that happens that sequential growth that we've seen this quarter.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Yes that would be a big deal. You go from a negative 8% to a positive 4%, I would imagine that has a\u2026","Keith D. Nosbusch","We saw this growth for up 4%. So we think we are in the rebound stage of the investments to your point","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay.","Keith D. Nosbusch","So Q3 this quarter we saw a little sequential growth and we think that bodes well for going forward in the resource industries.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay great thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks guys.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you Scott.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next line of question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, good morning everyone.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning Rich.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Two questions: On process \u2013 so you brought the full year down \u2013 full-year growth down. You referenced timing of projects. Where, geographically, are you seeing the biggest push-outs? I imagine there's \u2013 we covered Canada a bit, but if you could provide some more color on that? And then just, are there large projects, I assume that are going to help next year as well, and some of those projects that maybe thought were to hit this past quarter have been pushed out longer, or any additional color there, Keith, would be helpful. Thanks.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well I think where we've seen the biggest push outs have been in Asia Pacific in particular China, and then also in Latin America. Those would be the two regions that had the greatest effect. I don't think we are ready to talk about 2015 yet, but our frontlog in process in our solutions businesses doesn't indicate that we are going to see any significant change in the near-term. So, we are feeling optimistic about the solutions business going forward.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, and then just broadly speaking about projects in general \u2013 so, some of the push out in terms of Q4, typically solutions is pretty important to Q4 results. What are you assuming in the guide in terms of just the ramp and recovery of stuff that may have been delayed this quarter? Is there anything unusual in terms of bigger than normal rebound on delivery of solutions?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, I would say what we are expecting is a pretty normal Q3 to Q4 ramp in solutions. And we are reasonably comfortable with what's in the guidance based on what's in backlog at the end of Q3.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay and I just the quick follow-up on I know 2015 it's early but on the tax rate, Ted you would talked about the discrete items affecting next year should we think of the tax rate being lower in next year preliminarily?","Theodore D. Crandall","I mean I think we\u2019re talking about at this little bit in the past I think going forward kind of at these levels of income, something around 27% is probably a pretty reasonable tax rate to think about.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next line of question comes from the line of us Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Just a question on Latin America, you mentioned that you know expected to come back in this project timing I mean it sounds like it's kind of a debacle down there especially in Brazil. Now you guys have some consumer exposure and you\u2019re definitely a high-quality franchise in that market, but its macro just sounds pretty bad down there. What are you seeing that kind of gives you the optimism in the face of that?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I would say right now our backlog in our solutions businesses. We feel good about the Q4 and I mentioned that we are expecting to see double digit year-over-year growth in both Mexico and Brazil in Q4 and in a lot of cases that will be because of the solutions backlog that we expect to ship in the fourth quarter.","Now obviously if to your point there is a bigger, I'll just say external factor that creates more problems of particularly with the elections going on in Brazil, there's definitely some political\/economic risk in Brazil as we walk up to the fall elections and I would say it's probably a little dicier than it would have been in a normal fourth quarter for us. So we are watching it. At this point in time we haven't seen anything that would deviate from \u2013 that would causes us to deviate from our current expectations, but we know what happens in political elections.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Right. And then, obviously, beyond your control. And then, Ted, just on the margin in the fourth quarter, last year there was a pretty significant amount of noise. I mean, in architecture & software, your margin was up 200 basis points sequentially, but if you look back in the model, it really has a tendency to be flat to even down sequentially. I still don't know if that makes sense when you strip out all the noise from the fourth quarter of 2013, so maybe given these segments are kind of moving around a little bit in the fourth quarter, can you give us some sort of a high-level framework for how these two fit into that annual margin guidance for the fourth quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think consistent with prior practice I'm probably not going to help a lot on a by segment look at margins in the fourth quarter, but what I would say is we are expecting and it\u2019s obviously can do the math it's applies to guidance a pretty significant step up sequentially and margin, which is largely a consequence of just significantly higher sales as we go from Q3 to Q4.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","All right. Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Thank you.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. Just a question around some of the order activities, I guess some of your peers have sounded pretty positive around process automation orders. Your sales on the last call sounded good about pulp and paper, and oil and gas, demand. So I realize that there's a kind of a pause between project placement and the execution of the project. But maybe give a sense of how much your process business was up in orders, and what the overall backlog did year-on-year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","With process our orders were I think flat year-over-year in the quarter. And we did build process backlog in the quarter. So at this point, we feel that we will continue to see growth in our Q4 and certainly into the start of 2015 that we basically think of backlog as one to two quarters in our business and I would say we continue to feel that oil and gas will drive the big portion of our process business with continued interest in activity and quotation in the chemical side of the business and that's an area where we think we can continue to grow based upon our process control capabilities, our safety capabilities, and our motor control capabilities and we think that will create more opportunities and historically we've had in the chemical segments.","So continued strength in oil and gas to your point of pulp and paper in the U.S., anyway investments are being made and our most difficult process areas will be that the mining and the metals will be the two most difficult segments going forward and we really don't see a significant improvement in either one of those in the short-term.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then within the EMEA region, the organic growth dropped back a bit. You had sort of four quarters of 3% to 5% growth. Was the firm you saw just a comps issue? And I guess, was there any difference you saw between emerging EMEA and the trends in sort of Western and central Europe in terms of customer behavior?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, it was probably another generally typical quarter with respect to the geography and we saw greater growth in the North and particular Germany and the U.K. and I would say in emerging some greater difficulty because of Russia. Russia was a difficult third quarter for us, obviously, everyone understands what's going on there. And South America \u2013 South Africa I\u2019m sorry continued to say a weak although the mining has been the mining strikes have been stopped and we are starting to see some activity, but that did not happen in the third quarter at all.","So the emerging is split with growth in Eastern Europe and growth in the Middle East, but heavily influenced by the impact in Russia and South Africa to where actually emerging Europe was down slightly in Q3. So basically mature Europe carried the day in the quarter and as I said that was driven by strong performance in the north.","Theodore D. Crandall","And you know, Julian I think though we've always said there are some normal variability in quarter-to-quarter results and I think the 1% this quarter in Europe would chalk up more to normal variability then we would to a significant change in underlying market conditions.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, I think we continue to believe there is a slow steady growth in particular in the mature our European countries and I think the economic data in our product business performance would support that. And then we got the variability that Ted mentioned.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great, thank you.","Keith D. Nosbusch","You're welcome, Julian.","Operator","Thank you. The next line of question comes from Richard Eastman of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning, Richard.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Keith, could you just give a perspective perhaps on your maybe two or three best-growing end markets in the quarter? I mean, for instance, how did auto hold up? And oil and gas was presumably your better market, but just two or three best markets?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, well, I would say that in the quarter the best markets were oil and gas to your point, food and beverage and tire, would be the three best markets.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And as your frontlog may or may not indicate, what does the auto and tire business look like as we trend through the fourth quarter and into early 2015? Are you fairly confident that we can maintain some growth there, whether it's low-single or mid-single-digit growth in that kind of transportation end market?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think it will be low growth, because it's at a high level. So, we are not going to see a meaningful acceleration, but we are expecting overall global that will have a stable low single-digit growth in transportation as we go through Q4.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay and then, just one follow-up for Ted. When I do the incremental segment margins or incremental margins just in general, for the fourth quarter, they would appear to be pretty high. Seemingly, even at the midpoint, maybe above normal. And is that, again \u2013 is that driven by volume?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I would say your math is correct. I think what we are expecting is very attractive incremental margins in Q4 that are probably well above 40%, and maybe approaching 50%.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, okay.","Theodore D. Crandall","And it is driven by volume and also on a sequential basis, just not a lot of spending increase as we go from Q3 to Q4.","Richard C. Eastman \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, all right, limited spending. Okay, excellent. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your question. And, the next question comes from of Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Please go ahead.","D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning, Mark.","D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Keith, you mentioned that you're doing well with the OEMs in Europe. Does that imply that the OEM market is flat to down maybe in Europe? What's the market like right now, and what are your expectations for the market over the next few quarters?","Keith D. Nosbusch","If I left that impression that would be incorrect. The OEM market is growing in Europe. We are continuing to drive conversions. The fact that our European market was slightly up was more driven by the Solutions & Services variability that happens in the quarter, but we continue to see product growth in Europe. It's one of the reasons I mentioned motion had a good quarter which reinforces that also safety had a good quarter and that is also associated with success at OEM.","So if you look at some of the European statistics and the most relevant one would be the German DD&A Association they projected a plus 3% growth for calendar 2014. So we\u2019re still seeing growth in Europe in the OEM space and that's been quite frankly one of the highlights for us in Europe and the team there is doing a great job.","D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Well, I guess what I was highlighting is: How much are you outgrowing the OEM market itself? If it's 3%? Are you doing better than that as appose your \u2013 or total Europe.","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think we\u2019re probably almost double the underlying market.","D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay. And then back on to process, are there challenges in executing your process initiative, or is it just happen to be the markets that you are exposed to versus the overall process automation space, because the process automation pace seems to be outpacing where your process growth is. Can you speak to that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well I think what you may be seeing is more from an order standpoint and as appose to sales, but I don't think \u2013 right now I would not say we are having execution problems in executing our process initiative at all. That is not what I would put it on, we don't see any greater losses in our project, the win rates stays consistent, we continue to expand the footprint and our ability to address more applications and more industries, in particular there I'm referring to our growing capabilities in the chemical industry and of course we don't participate in the power generation distribution or refining and those tend to be our large projects and probably a little more market awareness because of the size of those of those projects, but we think we\u2019re doing just fine. Actually on a global basis in the process space and it continues to be our best growth opportunity so right now I would put it on timing and I would be the first to tell you when we believe it is not bad.","D. Mark Douglass \u2013 Longbow Research LLC","Okay, thank you","Operator","Thank you for your questions. The next line of question comes from Jeremie Capron of CLSA Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA","Hi. Good morning, everybody","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning Jeremy","Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA","A question on the Asia-Pacific region: You said business in China was down year-over-year. Yet we're seeing pretty solid growth from a number of automation companies that have a larger presence in the country. And when I look at your Asia-Pacific revenue this quarter, $221 million is flat year-over-year, but it's pretty much the same as two years ago, and it's still lower than three years ago. So I'm wondering, could you help us understand what's holding you back in that region, both in terms of the near-term dynamics and over that three-year period?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well I don't have the three-year numbers here, so I can't comment on that fact and that's something we\u2019ll follow-up with you on after the call, but with respect to the region, I would say our biggest challenge quite frankly has been India. And over the last couple of years we have seen significant reduction in our sales in India and that's probably been the biggest factor in the performance in the region.","I think overall we continue to see growth opportunities in China, we are achieving growth in some of the mature markets, we've had good growth in Japan over that three year period and the only other one I would put in the category of India would be Australia and that\u2019s where its been challenging obviously some of the strength in the Australian dollar over the last two years, the impact in mining and some of the decline of the manufacturing sector in Australia would be the other area where we see the weakness. So if you take out Australia and India, we still believe that we've been growing in the region and that our position has not been compromised or is significantly different than our competitors.","Theodore D. Crandall","Hey Jeremie this is Ted. The thing I would add and this strictly about China and strictly about the last year. We were down 5% in China, but we were up 16% sequentially in China in the quarter and year-to-date we\u2019re up 8%. The sequential comparison or the year-over-year comparison in Q3 in China down five that's against the quarter last year when our sequential growth from Q2 to Q3 last year was 40%. So we believe the 8% year-to-date growth is much more indicative of our underlying performance and frankly the underlying performance of the market than the third quarter.","Keith D. Nosbusch","We don't think is much different than the competition in that regard either.","Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA","Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. And Ted, as we've gone through the share buybacks, so you're running a little ahead of the initial plan, and you've got a new authorization out there. Should we expect the buybacks to continue well into next year?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think the expectation should be that we will continue to exhaust our free cash flow after acquisition spending on dividend and share repurchase. And so we will do that this year. We've may run a little but ahead of that depending on how cash flow comes in Q4 and depending on what we spend in Q4, but I think that's what your expectation should be going forward.","Jeremie Capron \u2013 CLSA","All right. That's very clear. Thank you very much.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you.","Rondi Rohr Dralle","We are at 8:30 Central U.S. time here, but I think we\u2019ll keep going for a couple more questions because we got a late start. Okay.","Operator","Thank you the next line of questions comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Thanks for fitting me in and good morning","Keith D. Nosbusch","Good morning Steve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Ted, just on the backlog question, I guess backlog is normally about 20% or so of next 12-months' sales and for, I guess, CP&S is like 30%. And for one quarter out, that number, is it closer to 50%, because what I'm trying to get at here obviously is just your confidence level in not just the backlog piece of this, but the non-backlog piece that's allowing you to forecast the significant step-up next quarter?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well Steve I think you know about roughly two thirds of our business is product sales where the backlog frankly isn't that important as a measure of performance in the next quarter. And a third of our business is Solutions & Services were with only one quarter to go the backlog is very important. So I would say on that third business, we have a pretty high level of confidence in our ability to deliver the sales and Solutions & Services. One the product side, I would say our confidence is less about backlog than it is about year-to-date performance in that business. The sales in order trends we saw as we came through Q3 and what we've heard from both our salespeople and our channel about expectations for Q4.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then on the incremental margin side, therefore, to get to that 40% to 50%, you mentioned it's mostly volume. Is there any risk? You mentioned the spending is up or flat sequentially. Does that mean also \u2013 sorry, year-on-year in Q4, is that about 5% or 6% again, or is that less year-on-year, the spending increase?","Theodore D. Crandall","I would expect the year-over-year increase in Q4 to be closer to 3%.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","3%, right. Okay. And the risk factor there very low at this point?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well I mean there are lot of factor that can influence the incremental margin, especially since it\u2019s a kind of second order measure, but I would say on the spending side I don\u2019t think there is a large risk of having a significant miss on spending.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Right. And pricing also?","Theodore D. Crandall","In pricing also I don\u2019t think is, in terms of our assumption for the quarters I don\u2019t believe are risky.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Right so it's back to volume. Okay. And sorry, one other sort of larger question, again. Ted or actually Keith on this, we've talked a lot in the past at prior Automation Fairs about the question of increasing competition on the process side as you guys have gained share and grown and other folks are trying to get their acts together there to come back. It's been a little while now. Are you seeing any kind of advancement in some of your competitive space here that's having any kind of impact on growth rates for you?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No I don\u2019t think we had \u2013 we seen any change, we continue to compete based upon what we would call the modern DCS, which is plant wide optimization that we offer, its huge differentiator and then in some cases again certain process controlled companies we have intelligent motor control and in some industries that combination between control and power is very important and it\u2019s a differentiator that we have. So we continue to be able to compete in both Brownfield as well as Greenfield applications, we certainly \u2013 it\u2019s a tough market to your point, but we can feel that we can continue to grow share as we proceed and have it be one of the factors that gives us the opportunity to drive revenue growth.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Okay, great. I'll pass it on, thanks.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thank you.","Theodore D. Crandall","Okay.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks Steve. Annette, we are just going to take one last question here and then we\u2019ll wrap up the call after that. Okay?","Operator","Okay. Thank you. The last question comes from the line Andrew Obin of Band of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. Can you just give in terms of growth through the quarter, I understand the comps issue, but did the growth accelerate, orders growth accelerate through the quarter or stable and sort of decelerated? And specifically, if you could comment what you are seeing in the U.S.?","Theodore D. Crandall","The quarter played out a little similar to Q3 and we did see acceleration as we went through the quarter in particular June was the strongest month in the quarter and we see that continue as we have gone into July at this point.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks a lot.","Theodore D. Crandall","You are welcome. Thank you.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. All right well. Yes sorry again for the delay at the start of this call. I appreciate your patience on that.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle. Please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thanks Ian. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO and Ted Crandall our Chief Financial Officer.","Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that include highlights on the company's performance in the fourth quarter and the full year and then some context around our outlook for fiscal 2015. Then Ted, will provide more details on the results as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always we'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks. We expect the call to take about an hour today.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website, at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30-days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks Rondi, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'll start with the highlights for the quarter and the full year, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.","Q4 results came in very close to the expectations we laid out on the July earnings call. Organic growth of over 4% in the quarter continued the pattern we saw most of the year, with product business growth exceeding growth in our solutions and services businesses.","There was an unexpected currency headwind in the quarter due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. Profitability was strong in the quarter with over 22% segment operating margin. Q4 tends to be one of our better margin quarters and this was true for both segments this quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share grew 15% and cash flow was good. So, very strong earnings performance and good sales growth in Q4. Ted will provide more details on the quarter, so I'll move to the full year.","As we entered fiscal 2014, we told you to expect higher year-over-year growth rates in the first half of the year than in the second half and that is how the year played out. Fiscal 2014 sales by region were about as expected with the exception of stronger sales in the U.S. and weaker sales in Canada.","Speaking to organic growth rates, the U.S. had a strong year with 7% growth and oil and gas was the best performing vertical. Canada was down 1% primarily due to weakness in resource based industries, the EMEA region grew 2% with 7% growth in emerging markets. Emerging markets represent about 20% of the EMEA region.","Western Europe was mixed with the U.K. and Italy up, Germany flat and France down year-over-year. Asia Pacific came in as expected with 5% organic growth through the year. China grew 6% with food and beverage at the highest growth vertical, our OEM business continues to grow [technical difficulty] total sales in China. Although still in the early stages and we're starting to see the anticipated step up in manufacturing investment for consumer package goods.","India grew 10% this year, albeit of easy comparison, but it appears that the weak industrial environment of the past few years has finally turned the corner. Latin America grew 6% for the year with strong sales in both Mexico and Brazil overcoming weakness in other parts of the region.","Globally, we had another year of solid performance with OEMs. We continue to broaden our content on machines, which is reflected in strength in our motion and safety businesses this year.","Here are a couple of other data points that are down the slide. Logic sales were up 7% this year. The compact logic portion is growing even faster than this with the highest growth rates in Asia Pacific.","Process sales were up 4% for the year. This is below the growth rate we expected at the beginning of the year and certainly below where we need this business to be. Weakness in metals, and mining, and EMEA in Asia and the lack of business in Venezuela, turned out to be larger headwinds than we expected.","Having said that, we continue to invest in our process capabilities, we are expanding our installed base of process control and continue to believe that processes are best growth opportunity.","Let me just wrap up on the year before I move on to the outlook. Fiscal 2014 was another year of record sales and earnings for the company. For the second year in a row we expanded segment operating margin almost a point, while continuing to invest for growth.","These results would not be possible without the efforts of our employees, partners and suppliers, and I want to thank them all for their ongoing commitment to our customers and their contributions to our success.","Our strong track record of returning cash to shareholders continued in fiscal 2014 with over $800 million in dividends and share repurchases. That represents 87% of free cash flow for the year.","As you probably saw, we raised a dividend last week which more than doubles our dividend per share in the last five years. During fiscal 2014, we also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchase.","I'm proud to say, that during the last five years we've returned $2.8 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases.","I keep looking forward to a year when everything is stable and the outlook is very clear, but I guess that's just wishful thinking. Here is what we are seeing out there. We are in the world of greater geopolitical uncertainty, falling oil prices and a stronger U.S. dollar.","The U.S. economy remains strong but recently some Western European countries have slowed and there is heightened uncertainty related to Russia, Ukraine and therefore the Middle East. In China, overcapacity, lack of liquidity, and underperforming loans are still weighing on economic growth, and Brazil is in a recession.","Having said that from a global macroeconomic perspective, forecast for GDP and industrial production, call for continued moderate growth in 2015. Most manufacturing PMIs are still above 50, and the U.S. PMI has been above 55 since June.","More specific to Rockwell and the automation market, the need for productivity and modernization, growing consumer demand in emerging markets and the connected enterprise are key drivers fueling continued market growth, and I believe we have the right strategy to capitalize on these opportunities.","Taking all of these factors into consideration, we expect total company organic sales growth in the range of 2.5% to 6.5% in fiscal 2015.And we are initiating fiscal 2015 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.95.","With another solid year in our sights, we continue to invest in innovative technology and domain expertise to expand the value we provide to customers while delivering superior returns to our shareowners.","Before I end my remarks, I\u2019d like to give you a little preview of Automation Fair. For those of you who haven\u2019t been to an Automation Fair, we expect to host thousands of customers and partners from all over the world.","It's a great opportunity for us to showcase our capability, provide technical training, and facilitate best practice sharing among our customers. It's taking place in Anaheim this year, and we will have an emphasis on the connected enterprise and how we are helping customers drive to the next level of productivity with our Integrated Control and Information portfolio.","If you're coming to Anaheim next Thursday, you\u2019ll hear from John McDermott, our Head of Global Sales and Marketing, Terry Gebert, who leads our Global Systems & Solutions business, and from one of our process system integrator partners.","Then we'll take you on a hosted tour of the show floor, after lunch we'll hold a webcast where Frank Kulaszewicz, Blake Moret, Ted, and I will talk more about our strategy and progress on the connected enterprise and Integrated Control and Information. We hope you'll take advantage of this opportunity and we look forward to seeing many of you there.","So now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ted. Ted?","Ted Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, every one. You\u2019ll note that we\u2019ve made some changes to several of the slides. We hope you\u2019ll find the new formats more informative and helpful.","I\u2019ll start with Page 4, fourth quarter key financial information. As Keith mentioned, organic growth, sales performance across the regions, and adjusted EPS were all pretty much as we expected and consistent with the mid-point of our guidance from July.","Currency turned out to be a headwind. We didn't expect that at the beginning of the quarter. Sales in the quarter were $1,782 billion, an increase of 3.9% compared to Q4 last year. Organic sales growth was 4.4%, currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 70 basis points.","Segment operating margin was very strong at 22.2%, that's up 130 basis points from Q4 last year. The year-over-year margin increase was primarily due to the higher sales partially offset by some increased spending.","You might recall that in Q4 of 2013, margin included some significant income from legal settlements and some larger restructuring charges, in the year-over-year comparison if you net legal settlement income and restructuring charges, we faced about $9 million margin headwind in Q4 of 2014.","General corporate net expense was $22.3 million in Q4, compared to $39.7 million a year ago. Last year, GCN expense included a $12 million charge related to legacy environmental matters. That item accounts for the largest share of the year-over-year difference.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.86, up $0.24 or 15% compared to last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $138.5 million. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 27%, compared to 23.7% in Q4 last year. I\u2019ll provide more color on tax rate when I cover the full year results.","Free cash flow for Q4 was $282 million, a little below Q4, 2013, but a very good result. Conversion on adjusted income was 110% in Q4.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $140 million, for the full year we repurchased a total of 4.1 million shares at a cost of $484 million. That was about 10% more than the $440 million we projected at the beginning of the year, and related to our strong cash flow performance.","Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 30.1%, that's a little below last year but still about 30%, and we consider that to be a best-in-class result.","Turning to Page 5, this is the full year version of the key financial information. Sales reached $6,624 billion for the full year, up 4.3%. Organic growth was 5.1%, currency translation reduced sales by almost one full point.","Segment operating margin for the full year was 20.4%, up 90 basis points from last year. Earnings conversion was 42% for the year. We realized very good leverage on the higher sales that more than offset spending increases. Spending for the full year increased pretty much inline with the sales growth.","Adjusted EPS was $6.17, up 8% compared to last year. And as Keith already mentioned, that represents another year of record sales in EPS for the company.","Free cash flow for the full year was $922 million, which was 107% conversion on adjusted income.","The next slide provides an adjusted EPS walk comparing the full year 2014, to 2013. I\u2019ll just hit a couple of items here.","Lower general corporate net expense contributed $0.08 to the adjusted EPS improvement. For the full year GCN was $81 million, down from $97 million in 2013. GCN expense was unusually high in 2013, primarily due to the legacy environmental charges that we took in fourth quarter of 2013, that I mentioned previously.","Moving to the far right side, you can see on the bridge that we picked up an additional $0.04 from reduced share count in 2014. And then coming back to tax rate, the increase adjusted effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 reduced the adjusted EPS by $0.30.","The year-over-year increase in the rate is primarily due to significant net favorable discrete items realized in fiscal 2013, and a smaller amount of net unfavorable similar items realized in fiscal 2014. Excluding the effect of the higher tax rate, adjusted EPS would have increased by 13%.","The next two slides present a graphical view of the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. I\u2019ll start with the architecture and software segment on Page 7. I'll cover Q4 and then the full year.","On the left side of this chart, you can see that architecture and software segment sales reached $747 million in Q4, an increase of 4.6% compared to Q4 last year. Organic growth was 5.2%.","Moving to the right side of the chart, on the 5.2% organic growth ANS margins increased by 60 basis points to 31.1%. A great quarter for the segment was strong conversion despite the headwind from the legal settlement income in Q4 of last year.","For the full year, ANS sales were up 6.1% as reported, with 6.8% organic growth. We're very pleased to see that high rate of growth and almost profitable segment.","Segment operating margin for the full year was 29.5%, up 120 basis points from 2013.","Now, I'll turn to Page 8, a similar view for the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the fourth quarter, Control Products & Solutions segment sales increased by 3.3% year-over-year, as organic growth of 3.8%.","Organic growth for products, sales and segment was 5.3% about the same as architecture and software, organic growth for solutions and services sales was 3%.","The book-to-bill in Q4 per solutions and services was 0.84%. That's low. We expected something more in the range of 0.9% to 0.95%.","You might remember we experienced the similar book-to-bill at the end of 2012. This past quarter was not quite as low as Q4 2012, but we ended fiscal 2014 with lower than expected backlog and that will have a negative impact on solutions and services sales in the first half of fiscal 2015.","CP&S delivered very good operating margin in Q4 at 15.8%, that's up 180 basis points compared to last year. Q4 is generally the strongest margin quarter in this segment. The operating margin increase was quite strong leverage on higher sales and good productivity in the quarter.","For the full year CP&S sales reached $3,778 billion up 3% year-over-year or 3.8% organic growth. Organic growth for product business sales and the segment was 4.7% for the full year and 3.2% for solutions and services.","CP&S segment operating margins for the full year was 13.6%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to 2013.","Page 9, provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows organic growth results for the quarter and for the full year. Keith provided a good deal of color on the full year results, I'll just speak to the quarter.","U.S. growth in Q4 at 5% will continue to see a very healthy underlying market. In Q4 oil and gas and home and personal care verticals were the highest growth.","Canada delivered a quarter of positive growth at 6%. The underlying market in Canada remains relatively weak. The results in Q4 are more about project timing and driven primarily by automotive and consumer.","EMEA was down slightly in the quarter. The emerging countries in aggregate experienced some modest growth. For Western Europe was down about two points year-over-year. Two of the weaker verticals in the quarter were metals and water wastewater.","In Asia Pacific sales were up 5% year-over-year in Q4. India was up over 20%. We are pleased to see India continue to demonstrate growth, admittedly off an easy comparison.","China was up 1% year-over-year in Q4. Based on the amount of project business in China and last year's quarterly comparisons, I think the full year growth rate for 2014 of 6% is a better indicator of underlying market conditions and our performance. In Q4 in China the strongest verticals were consumer industries.","In Latin America another good quarter with 12% growth once again led by Brazil and Mexico. Both countries had solid double-digit growth rates and that allowed for the 12% overall region growth despite a significant year-over-year decline in Venezuela. Best verticals in Latin America in Q4 were consumer industries. Organic growth in emerging markets was 8% led by Latin America.","And that takes us to the fiscal 2015 guidance slide. Just to reinforce some of Keith's comments on the macro outlook, in 2015 we expect global GDP and IP growth to be similar to last year. With IP growth in North America lower than in 2014, but IP growth somewhat higher in the other regions compared to 2014.","We expect fiscal 2015 sales to be approximately $6.8 billion plus or minus about 2%. That's an organic growth range of 2.5% to 6.5%.","By region, we expect growth rates in 2015 to be similar to last year. The U.S., Asia Pacific and Latin America should all see mid-single digit growth. We expect EMEA to be low single digit growth with growth driven primarily by emerging EMEA. This is the region we are watching most closely due to recent macro data and political uncertainties.","We expect Canada to be about flat year-over-year for 2015 with continued weakness in the oil sands. Based on the beginning solutions and services backlog and recent order trends, we expect 2015 to be a second year of higher growth in our product businesses, about 5% organic growth compared to 3% organic growth in our solutions and services businesses.","We expect currency to reduce sales by above 180 basis points next year. That\u2019s significant and primarily weaker Europe. Our projection for translation impact assumes average rates for 2015 at above the average level for October.","For example, we're assuming an average euro rate of 1.27. Yesterday the euro rate was 1.24, if it stays that way for the full year, we'll have additional translation headwind to contend with.","We expect segment operating margins to be about 21% that would be about half point increase compared to 2014 with conversion margin of about 35%. We expect the full year tax rate to be about 27%, a little over than in 2014. Our guidance for adjusted EPS is $6.55 to $6.95.","We expect free cash flow conversion on adjusted income of about 100%. And there are a couple of other items not shown here. General corporate net expense should be approximately $80 million next year. We expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about $136 million for the full year.","Because of the lower than expected backlog at the end of 2014, you should expect a slower than normal start in Q1. We typically see a sequential decline in total company sales from Q4 to Q1 but in 2015 that's likely to be at larger than average client.","Reported sales in Q1 will likely be down year-over-year with headwind from currency and roughly flat organic growth, the flat organic growth due to the lower backlog in solutions and services.","The final slide on Page 11 provides a walk from fiscal 2014 to fiscal year 2015 for adjusted EPS at the mid point of guidance. I'll start with operating pension expense. Interest rates dropped over the course of 2014 and that's created a $0.04 headwind in operating pension expense for 2015.","I mentioned currency effects on the prior chart. We expect currency effects to reduce earnings next year by about $0.17.","The lower tax rate contributes about $0.05 increase. We expect share count increased adjusted EPS by $0.17 in 2015. We intend to continue to return excess free cash flow to investors. We announced the 12% increase in the dividend last week as Keith mentioned.","The amount we spend on share repurchase in 2015 will depend on free cash flow and acquisition spending. But assuming 100% conversion on adjusted income and about $100 million of spending on acquisitions, we would expect to spend about $470 million on repurchases in 2015.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi for questions.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks Ted. Before we get started, I'd just like to remind you that and ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then if you have another question on a different topic to get back in the queue. So we\u2019d appreciate that. Ian, let's go ahead and take our first caller.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Good morning, everybody.","Keith Nosbusch","","Good morning, Scott.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","","Hi, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","I know it's tough. You guys don't have a lot of visibility so guidance can be a little challenging, but what does it -- historically if you go back and look at longer data series, what does it mean when solutions and services comes in week like that? Is there a canary in a coal mine effect there, or is it just a lumpy enough business where we shouldn't read too much into it?","Keith Nosbusch","I think historically it's been a lumpy business and there is not a lot to read into it with a quarter or two of data. I think if you go back to 2012 which Ted referenced, the second half of 2013 was very strong in the solutions business.","So I think it's just a matter of the ability to rebuild the backlog particularly in the SSB portion of that business and the medium voltage portion of that business.","And right now from a front log standpoint, we still see activity other than some project push-outs and delays because of the commentary that Ted and I talked about with respect to whether its geopolitical or economic uncertainty in some of the regions in particularly Asia Pacific and EMEA.","We are still seeing and are still quoting at a \u2013 I'll say pre-Q4 rate. So we don't see the indication of one quarter of, quit candidly week book-to-bills that it's telling us anything at this time.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","","Okay. And as a follow up, can you give us a sense of there's -- you'll have an increased headwind maybe with oil and gas, but when you think about mining which has been tough for the last couple of years, does that turn the corner for you in 2015 and start to become a neutral or at least potentially a modest tailwind from a very low level?","","Keith Nosbusch","","Well we would expect it to be a neutral, I mean that is our plan. I think the upside would come from the opportunity to see China grow a little faster and drive demand at a higher rate than they have this past year.","And the other part would be the conversion of spending from I'll say CapEx to operating spending where they\u2019re trying to drive productivity. And I think there is a lot of emphasis particularly in some of the larger mining companies to now focus on productivity and generating better asset utilization on their existing investment.","So, I think that\u2019s the other space that we can look for. But right now we see mining as a neutral next year.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. I'll see you guys next week.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks for coming Scott. We will see you then. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you, Scott. We have another question for you, this one is from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Rich.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi, good morning everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","How you're doing? Just wondered a second, what's the expectation for process growth for 2015 at this point? I know that it was a little bit below expectation for 2014. How are you thinking about the puts and takes there?","Keith Nosbusch","","Well for process for 2015, we expect process to grow mid-to-high single digits. So definitely a better growth rate than this year.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then is the oil and gas vertical -- how do you think about that in terms of your exposure between upstream and midstream? And what are you seeing in terms of front log activity that would bolster the growth rate or detract from the growth rate at this point?","","Keith Nosbusch","","Well from our position we've been a stronger in the upstream sector over the last couple of years and certainly that plays to more of our strengths in both motor control as well as process control.","And what we are seeing now is some of the investments moving to midstream and ultimately downstream. And there in the midstream sector, we do well in some of the transportation and storage facilities.","I think one of the weaknesses that we\u2019ve seen is when there is a lot of investment in that midstream petrochemical and chemical market, that's an area where we don\u2019t have a lot of installed base and its also an area that we don\u2019t have the perfect match with our plant-wide optimization strategy and so its much more focused on safety and intelligent motor control there.","As we see it move further downstream, and when I meant in that area, I would say that chemical and the bulk chemical and the oil refining areas is what I was talking about. As it continues to move downstream, we think it\u2019s much more suitable, in particular lot of those applications are batch whether it would be specialty or refined chemical and we see that as another opportunity for us.","With the current situation of what the pricing levels of oil are, we don\u2019t see a significant change at this time. This is an industry that really invest in the long term and so our two quarters of reduced prices not going to dramatically change a lot of their investment decisions. In fact last throughout 2015 that would be a different situation than what we currently have.","And quite frankly oil and gas is one of the better growth verticals in fiscal year 2014. It's still healthy. We see the growth and I think I might have said 2014, I meant 2015, next year we see it as one of our better growth initiatives and we expect it to grow above the company average.","So, we still see that as an opportunity for us and an opportunity to expand our share in that vertical.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thanks, Keith. That's helpful. Just a quick one, Keith or Ted I might have missed this. Did you get a buyback expectation for 2015? I might have missed this.","Ted Crandall","Yeah. I mean, assuming the 100% conversion on adjusted income and assuming about $100 million of acquisitions spending, we expect to spend about $470 million next year on repurchases.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks Rich.","Operator","And Keith, we have another question for you. This is from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, John.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","","Hi, John.","","John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG","Could you provide a little bit more color on if you call it lumpiness within solutions by vertical? Is that possible, Ted and Keith? Is there a vertical or two that's maybe providing the somewhat lower conversion rates or book-to-bill today?","Keith Nosbusch","No. It's not so much specific verticals, it\u2019s more of just a timing of projects, which can occur in many of the verticals. However, I would say, it's probably more significant in heavy industries where the projects tend to be bigger, they tend to be predicated around resource based pricing, commodity pricing.","So I would say those are the ones that are most impacted as opposed to consumer, where they tend to be plant investments that are as significant in magnitude of dollars.","So, I would characterize it that way, but any quarter, it could be any one of the industries, it could be metals, mining, oil and gas, pulp and paper, water wastewater, and - I think we mentioned this quarter, that more difficult ones were metals and mining, particularly in EMEA and Asia.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG","And actually that all dovetails with the phenomenon that you've seen these larger more complicated projects get pushed to the right. So I'm presuming solutions is caught up a little bit in that. Can I ask you about process?","If you look at Honeywell and Emerson and some of the others, they're seeing pretty good orders kick in for North America for lots of different reasons. And I realize that you're not completely apples to apples with those companies, but you do play in a lot of the same spaces. Do you think process needs a bit of a kicker to get it to the next level, Keith? Or are you satisfied that based on this positioning, new product backlog, and the cadence of business that it's on track to capture incremental share, based on the way it performed earlier in this cycle?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, John, great question. I mean, quite frankly I am not satisfied with our results in process. I think because of its importance to us, the fact that it is our best growth opportunity that we can't reach our growth objectives without a share increase. And so, we are continuing to invest to expand our capabilities and our commercial reach in process applications.","We will continue to make specifically targeted investments to accelerate our growth, and quite frankly this is a very important focus for me and us in 2015. To be fair, some of these areas are not where we have a large installed base, and it's not where we - I would say are recognized as the key player.","But certainly we have expanded our capabilities and for us to continue to grow our presence, grow our share, we have to win in some of these new applications and new areas - geographies and so, we can and will do better here.","And I think it's just a continuation and evolution of our growth and our maturing as a process control DCS supplier, and we\u2019re very excited about our modern DCS system that we think brings tremendous value and certainly that is \u2013 that will be one of the key points of our conversations during Automation Fair, and we see that as a continuing evolution of our business strategy and capabilities.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","And Keith, do you think you can do this organically, or does the experience of process in the past year and as markets fluctuate and evolve, maybe you have to begin to add more on the M&A front for whatever purpose or whatever application? Has your thinking evolves or changed in any way with respect to that business and capital allocation?","Keith Nosbusch","I don't think that we need to make an acquisition. We constantly look at different acquisitions, process would be an area where we continue to evaluate opportunities and also the rest of the process base, and how can we do more in the entire market.","So, I don't see where acquisition is silver bullet here. I think we look at it as how can we continue to grow our domain expertise, how can we build up the resources that we have calling on customers in various geographies and various industries, and various engineering environments.","And I think it\u2019s something we can do a lot ourselves and if the right opportunity comes along given that this is an area for growth for us, we'll certainly look at an acquisition to accelerate what we would view as a more organic play at this point in time.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank AG","Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Keith Nosbusch","You're welcome, John. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, John. We have another question for you, this one is from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey guys, good morning.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So I'm just having even with the solutions book-to-bill the way it is in the first quarter. I'm having a hard time getting to flat organic. How much is the ForEx headwind in the first quarter?","Ted Crandall","It will probably be about two points.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. And then just how does that impact the incremental? Maybe if you could also talk about why the incremental margin in architecture and software was so strong this quarter? You guys have called out the net benefits of in the fourth quarter of 2013, so maybe just some color around how the incrementals trend year to year? Obviously you're going to be down in the first quarter, so maybe just a little bit of high-level on how the - will margins be down in the first quarter as well?","Ted Crandall","It would not be unusual to see a decline in margins with a decline in sales, and there's always a sequential decline in sales Q4 to Q1.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. That's helpful. One last question just on the forward guide. What are you assuming for specific growth in oil and gas? And then maybe if you could give -- do you have a breakout of what your upstream versus down and mid is for that business?","Ted Crandall","If you lumped upstream and midstream together our split of business is about 90% upstream, midstream and about 10% downstream.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Right. So that obviously would explain the difference between you guys and Honeywell and Emerson to a good degree as far as differences in trends I would assume. And so what are you thinking for growth there? Is that at the high end of the process range of high-single digits oil and gas this year?","Ted Crandall","We don't give guidance generally by vertical I think. But I think it would be fair to say we expect oil and gas to be kind of at or above company average next year.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","One last question. Just very quickly if you start at flat organic, should we think about this as kind of -- are you going to be better than seasonal for the last three quarters of the year? Or are you assuming - is there anything that bounces back? Is this an issue of the funnel isn't clicking here, but you have such a big funnel that at some point in the next three or four quarters there's going to be a lot of stuff that falls through despite the little bit of a weaker start to the year?","Ted Crandall","I think you've characterized it well. I mean, product businesses like two-thirds of our total business, and we\u2019re seeing good momentum and continuing healthy order trends in the product business. We have a hole in the backlog in the solutions and services business to begin the year.","So compared to the average, our loading in the year is going to be a little more back-end weighted than the average. Keith talked about - we don\u2019t think that, that's all in the backlog in Q4 is kind of indicative of fundamental change in the market, rather it's just kind of a lumpiness in that business, in that regard.","We're seeing pretty healthy orders performance in the month of October. It's only one month. We don't want to draw conclusions based on that, but it\u2019s somewhat encouraging.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And is most of that oil and gas that's expected to come back?","","Ted Crandall","No. I wouldn't say that. I would say - I think Keith addressed this, I mean - it was broad, the performance in the fourth quarter in solutions and services \u2013 what we saw shortfall was pretty broad across verticals, I would say if anything it was maybe more regional in terms of being weak in Asia and weak in EMEA.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Thank you, Steve. We another question for you, this one is from Steven Winoker at Bernstein Research. Please go ahead, Steven.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.","Thanks and good morning. Ted, let me start with you. On the incremental margin front for the guidance at about 21%, I'm thinking about that at 60 basis points in 2015 versus 90 in 2014 on just slightly better growth. You talked about Q1 just now. But maybe talk a little bit about the investment -- pace of investments in R&D and sales expense. What are the kinds of things are you picking up at all on that front that -- or is this just a question of look, at the midpoint range that's how we get there, but there's obviously a significant amount of upside to the op margin target as well if we hit high end of our range? Maybe a little color there.","Ted Crandall","So, there's a lot there.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.","That's just the first question.","Ted Crandall","We have 5.1% organic growth in 2014, and spending was up about 4%. So relatively in line but a little bit below the organic growth. The midpoint of guidance for 2015, is 4.5%, so little bit lower organic growth, but with roughly the same increase expected in spending, maybe even a little bit more.","Okay. And so that's in part - I mean there's a lot of factors that are in that margin including currency. But I would say that\u2019s probably the largest factor that results in a 60 basis point improvement rather than a 90 basis point improvement year-over-year.","In terms of where that investment is going, it is not significantly different than what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The larger share of that is going to increase R&D, and with our focus on continuing to expand the capabilities of the Logix platform, and building on some of the things we\u2019ve talked about around Integrated Control and Information. And then it's also in continuing to extend commercial resources so that we can grow in the targeted industries.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.","","Okay. Great. Keith, maybe a little more color, and this may be more appropriate next week when I see you, but some of the other competitors that were mentioned earlier in particularly maybe more some of the downstream applications, but you see some of the technology investments around everything from the world evolving from Emerson's charmed approach originally to Honeywell's making a big deal out of universal I\/O and cloud engineering and virtualization and the kinds of things that can take out installation time. I think it's beyond just a specific domains where their installed bases are strong.","But from a process perspective, are you starting to -- is this an area that you guys are starting to already ahead of addressing? Is this any part of the process discussion that you just mentioned earlier? How should we think about that area?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, quite frankly we've had capabilities in all of those areas already. We do have a capability to utilize virtualization for helping customers simplify their plant floor and also to isolate them from some of the changes in software technologies. Cloud is something that quite frankly I think we pioneered in the industry, in particular in remote monitoring applications, and in particular around critical assets.","So we feel really good in that. We have a very broad IO portfolio that is able to simplify the customers installation and application and maintenance which is a very big part of this.","So, on our technology front, I think we have a very strong story there. And then of course, we continue to have two major differentiators and one would be a plant wide optimization, there is still an awful lot of multi-discipline control that occurs in many of these applications.","And we have the ability to have integrated intelligent motor control, which is very key in particular in the heavy industries and those differentiators continue to be very viable against the pure DCS companies.","So, I think we continue to be able to demonstrate a value proposition that can give us a competitive differentiation, and a customer value proposition that helps them reduce their business cost.","So, as I said, we've been a leader in some of these spaces, and two of those would have been virtualization, which we started a couple of years ago, and then remote asset monitoring and cloud based solutions which is about a year ago, we created that capability.","So, I think from a technology standpoint, we feel good. Obviously there is a lot more we need to do and continue to evolve these technologies, but I don't think that we see ourselves at a disadvantage.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.","Great. I look forward to learning more and seeing you next week. Thanks.","Keith Nosbusch","Hey, sounds great. And we'll have people being able to cover all of those areas for you when you're there.","Steven Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thanks, Steve. And we have another question for you. This one is from Jeremie Capron from CLSA.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Hi, good morning. A question on the factory automation side of the business and your alliance with FANUC. Keith, I wonder if you could give us more details on this alliance? It looks like it's taking a new dimension beyond automotive powertrain. And in particular could you explain us what are the benefits from Rockwell's perspective?","Keith Nosbusch","Well first, the primary focus is on powertrain. So let me talk a little bit about that, and then I can expand to the point that you were making. But certainly fair enough, the benefits to Rockwell Automation is that FANUC is world leader in CNC and in robotics, and industrial robotics.","So, we see it as an opportunity to help our mutual customers have a more seamless integrated solution that enables them to provide a safer contemporary work environment, as well as - as we talked now, the Integrated Control and Information Solution to help them do a better job of creating zero downtime, which is something that\u2019s very critical in the powertrain automotive space in their plants today with the way they run them.","So we see customer benefits, we see two world leaders providing a best-in-class solution of Integrated Control and Information, and it basically helps faster time to market and reduce total cost of ownership. So, we see great business value for our customers.","As far as the expansion of that, I mentioned the robotics area and certainly in some of the consumer products industries and the line applications where you\u2019re doing palletizing and taste packing or other types of material handling applications, we see the integration with robotics as very important, and the ability to do that with an integrated solutions once again creates differentiation and value for customers.","So, automotive is the first place where this will create differentiation and then we\u2019ll see it moving to other industries, other verticals, particularly through the robotics side of it, and the CNC is heavy in the machining which is obviously powertrain.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Thanks. And a follow-up question for Ted this time. On the tax rate we are looking at 27% for next year. So pretty much the same as last year, but somewhat higher than in previous years. So should we think of that 27% as the right level in other years as well? Could you explain the dynamics behind this increase in the effective tax rate in recent years?","Ted Crandall","I would say the biggest dynamic in terms of the increase from where we were in 2012 and 2013, is \u2013 in those years we had some favorable discrete items, some larger favorable discrete items that were recognized that brought down the tax rates.","In 2014, we actually had some smaller, unfavorable discrete items, I think the 27% in 2015, it's reasonable to think of as kind of more of a underlying run rate tax rate.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Great. Thanks very much. And see you next week.","Keith Nosbusch","Looking forward to it.","Operator","Thank you. We have another question for you. This one is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","","Hi, thanks. Just on your China business, the slowdown that you had was similar to what a lot of other electricals had seen in the September quarter. It sounds like you think that will be up about mid-single digits in fiscal 2015. So just wondered what the visibility was like on China and when you think that will start to return to growth?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we expect growth next year. So, I think the challenge for us this past year was in our solution business. We had very good growth in OEMs and with our product portfolio for OEMs, and OEMs now continue to become a bigger portion of our total sales.","As far as the solution side of it, I think we see continued slowness in metals because of the overcapacity that's in China today. And we see improvements in oil and gas in China, next year. And I think \u2013 and somewhat in mining is hopefully one of the areas that will see an increase, but as far as the visibility, Ted mentioned some of the improvements in October and certainly China had a stronger solutions order month than in Q4.","So, some of that was project push-outs that we have been talking about, that in the last call and now this call that we saw in Q4. So, we\u2019re starting to see some of that flow through the pipeline so to speak at this point.","So, we obviously with the cycle being extended, which we definitely have seen the order cycle in the solutions business has doubled in the last half year. So we know things have slowed down and so it\u2019s just a matter of when do those break loose, and certainly that\u2019s part of how we characterize the outlook for this year, and I think it was an earlier question that we do see the second half stronger solution sales than we\u2019re going to have in the first half.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then just my follow up is on the food and beverage market. You've heard some industrial companies talk about slowdowns there or order push-outs in food and beverage. That had been very strong for Rockwell. I just wondered if you'd seen any change in customer spending there?","Keith Nosbusch","Not really in food and beverage, I think that\u2019s been a little more regional where things have gone up or down, we talked about the strength, Ted mentioned it as far as Q4, there was good strength in China, in particular Latin America, and certainly that's part of the reason we have the OEM growth is because of what's happening there, and food and beverage was the strongest vertical in China in fiscal year 2014. And at the end of the year I think Q4 in Latin America, it was the strongest vertical as well.","So, we see food continue to be strong. I think that was reinforced with some of the commentary at Pack Expo this last week in Chicago. I think of the two segments, beverage maybe the one that will be a little weaker as we go through 2015, given some of the changes that's going on in the industry dynamics themselves. But we do see this as an opportunity for us next year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Julian.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Ian, we\u2019re going to go ahead and we\u2019ll take one last call.","Operator","Thank you. The last one is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning, thanks for squeezing me in.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Morning, morning. So, you covered a lot of ground, so I'll be brief in the interest of time. I was just wondering on your upstream oil and gas exposure obviously was a very big focus last year at Automation Fair in Houston. How much of it is actually North America centric? We obviously already have the weakness in the Canadian Oil Sands, but when we think about North America in aggregate, how would you size it?","Keith Nosbusch","From a geographic standpoint, it's probably around 60\/40, North America and certainly when I say North America, I would be including Mexico in that. So we\u2019ve got Mexico, we\u2019ve got U.S. and Canada, it\u2019s probably about 60% of our upstream business.","And then obviously we\u2019ve done work in China, we do work in the North Sea, and the Middle East, and Brazil. So there is a number of other areas where we have our capabilities, but the largest footprint would be the totality of the North American region.","Ted Crandall","And interestingly the dispersion of our - the geographic dispersion of the oil and gas revenue is in a lot different than our total revenue.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. And then just on Europe, obviously the macro weakness understandable and visible. I'm just wondering if you're seeing anything different in the European OE machine builders? In other words any early indication that euro weakness is helping them in any way kind of pulling through to your business differently?","Keith Nosbusch","No. We haven't seen any changes in that dynamic. What I would say - what we are seeing is with the challenges going on in Russia and Eastern Europe, we are seeing some slowness in the exporting of Germany. And Germany has a lot of business that flows East through Central and Eastern Europe, and into Russia. And I think with the issues there, I would say that's where there\u2019s been some impact with the OEM performance in Europe for us.","We still see good shipments back into the U.S., good shipments into the majority of the Asian countries, but that flow into the East as probably been the only area that we've seen a dynamic or I should say a change from what we would be talking about six months ago.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thanks. And then just one little quick final follow-up for Ted. Ted, just the cash geographically, is the repo that you laid out pretty much kind of all you are really kind of capable of given kind of stranded cash issues? Could you just kind of address where we're at with that currently?","Ted Crandall","I think it would be - I think it would be fair to characterize it as what we\u2019re capable of without significant increase borrowings.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Great.

I need to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the line for questions. [Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris ","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal \u201817 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today are Blake Moret, our President and CEO; and Ted Crandall, CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available at that website for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Moret","Thanks, Patrick, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter so please turn to page three in the slide deck. We had a good start to fiscal 2017. Organic growth was 4% better than we expected. Our largest market, the U.S., returned to growth and we saw double-digit growth in emerging markets. Globally, consumer and transportation were our strongest verticals. Oil and gas and mining remained our weakest verticals but have now been stable sequentially for several quarters. While the quarter was better than we expected, we believe we may have seen a somewhat higher than normal budget flush at the end of the quarter primarily in the U.S. and we did see some larger projects hit in Q1 that we expected later in the year.","From a regional perspective, as I mentioned, U.S. returned to organic growth earlier than we expected. Strong growth in consumer and automotive was partially offset by weakness in heavy industries including oil and gas and mining. As expected, EMEA started the year slowly and was down about 2% year-over-year. However, orders were up year-over-year and we expect sales growth for the balance of the in this region. Our performance in Asia was better than we expected, with strong in the consumer and transportation verticals.","We saw growth across all countries in this region including China where we saw double-digit growth. And in Latin America, growth was driven by Mexico and Brazil. A couple of additional comments about the quarter. Our recent acquisitions performed well and contributed almost 2% to sales growth. Our process business improved and was about flat year-over-year organically. Including our recent Maverick acquisition, process was up high single digits. Architecture & Software had a very strong quarter with almost 8% organic growth. Within this segment, Logix was also up 8% compared to last year. I\u2019m also pleased with over 21% segment margin in the quarter. Ted will elaborate more in Q1 financial performance in his remarks.","Let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the balance of fiscal 2017. The macro outlook remains consistent with our assumptions earlier in the fiscal year which - continued growth in the consumer and transportation verticals. Oil and commodity prices have been stable or inched up and our business in these markets has been relatively flat now for few quarters. We expect every industry to be about flat year-over-year. Recent projections continue to call for improving GDP and industrial production growth rates as well as higher levels of local capital expenditures. Taking the macro outlook and our strong first quarter into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2017 organic sales to be up about 3% year-over-year. Including the impact of acquisitions and a larger headwind from currency, we continue to project fiscal 2017 sales of little over $6 billion and revising the adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.95 to $6.35. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Ted, let me add a few comments. A couple of months ago we hosted many of you at our annual Automation Fair in Atlanta. Once again it was a resounding success as thousands of customers and partners attended and learned about our latest technology innovations and capabilities. We\u2019ve heard that our customer testimonials resonated with many of you and provided powerful examples of how we partner with our customers and help them become more globally competitive. Strong underlying demand for our products enables us to accelerate investments this year in core technologies and domain expertise and to expand in new value, we\u2019re providing information solutions and connected services. Together, these will further enhance our ability to bring the connected enterprise to light and profitably grow share at customers globally. And the powerful indicator that our integration is creating value for customers is the recognition we are receiving.","Control magazine, a leading process industry publication recently released its 2017 Readers\u2019 Choice Awards. Our results looked great as we again won both first place awards than any other company. Now, as we get ready to hear from Ted, I want say a few words about him. As you probably all know by now, this is Ted\u2019s last earnings call in the CFO role but I\u2019m very happy to be able to continue to leverage his well recognized experience and understanding of our connected enterprise strategy in the CP&S segment leadership role.","I\u2019m also very pleased to welcome Patrick to my senior leadership team. With his proven leadership and extensive experience, I\u2019m confident he will move seamlessly into his new role as CFO. The leadership changes are the result of a thoughtful and long-term leadership succession plan that maximizes the contribution of our experienced leaders while ensuring the continuous addition of new talent and prospective for our company, customers, partners and investors. On a personal note, Ted has helped immensely with my own transition. I believe we have a great management team in place.","With that, Ted.","Ted Crandall ","Thank you, Blake and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on page four which is the first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1,490 million, an increase of 4.5% compared to Q1 last year. Sales increased 3.8% on an organic basis. Acquisitions contributed 1.8% to growth and currency translations reduced sales in the quarter by 1.1%. Segment operating margin was 21.2%, 50 basis points higher than Q1 last year and primarily due to higher sales and lower spending and despite the restoration of incentive compensation that we talked about in the November guidance. Spending was a bit light in the first quarter and you should expect spending to increase as we proceed into the balance of the year. The margin result also reflected a good productivity result in Q1 including savings from our restructuring actions in Q4 last year.","General corporate net expense was $15 million compared to $18 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.75, an increase of $0.26 or 17% compared to the first quarter of last year. The increase is due to the combination of higher sales, improved margins and a lower tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.1% compared to 22.8% in Q1 last year. As expected, the adjusted effective rate in Q1 included a significant benefit from discreet tax items. We talked about this benefit when we provided guidance in November.","A relatively small part of the discrete tax benefit was due to our adoption of the new accounting standard regarding equity based compensation. Free cash flow for Q1 was $271 million, free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 119%. Our trailing four quarter return on invested capital was 34.6%. And a couple of other items, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were $129.7 million, down about 2% compared to last year and during the first quarter, we repurchased almost 650,000 shares at a cost of about $81 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $864 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page five is the Architecture & Software segment. Beginning on the left side of this page, Architecture & Software segment sales were $696 million in Q1, up 8.3% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales increase was 7.6%, currency translation reduced sales by 1% and acquisitions contributed 1.7% to sales growth. Moving to the right side of the chart, A&S margins were 30%, up 2.6 points compared to prior year and primarily due to the operating leverage associated with higher sales coupled with lower spending.","Moving to page six, the Control Products & Solutions segment. In the first quarter, Control Products & Solutions sales were $794 million, up 1.3% year-over-year. Organic sales increased 0.7%, currency translation reduced sales by 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 1.9% to growth. In the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales increase was about 3%, solutions and services sales were down about 1% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.11. CP&S operating margin was 13.6% in Q1, down 1.7 points year-over-year, the biggest factor being higher incentive compensation costs.","Moving to page seven, this provides a breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. Blake covered much of this in his remarks, I\u2019ll add just a couple of comments. The organic sales growth in Q1 was driven primarily by Asia-Pacific and North America. Asia-Pacific was up 20% year-over-year with China and India each up mid-teens. We experienced strong growth in both product and solutions and services businesses in the region. The strong growth in Asia-Pacific was admittedly off[ph] relatively easy comparisons and as Blake mentioned, sales performance benefited from some favorable timing on larger projects that we thought would hit later in the year. Overall for the company, organic growth for emerging markets was 11% this quarter. And that takes us to the guidance slide.","As Blake mentioned, we\u2019re making some changes, primarily based on the better than expected sales performance in Q1, we\u2019re increasing our expectations for organic growth by one point across the range to a midpoint for organic growth of 3% for the full year compared to the previous 2% and the new range of 1% to 5% organic growth. The better than expected organic growth in Q1 accounts for most of the increase the organic growth guidance for the full year, though our outlook for sales for the balance of the year remains reasonably constant with our November guidance. Based on recent currency rates, we now expect the larger headwind from currency translation, the headwind increasing from about 0.5 point to a little less than 2 points. We still expect total sales to be a little over $6 billion with the additional currency headwind offsetting the higher organic growth. Our previous margin guidance was about 20%. In November I said may be that would be a little lower than 20%.","Now we think maybe it\u2019s a little higher than 20%. Previously, we expected a full year adjusted tax rate of 24%, we now expect that to be closer to 23.5% and basically that reflects a somewhat higher discrete tax benefit in Q1 than we previously thought. We\u2019re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.85 to $6.25 to a new range of $5.95 to $6.35 and the midpoint increases from $6.05 to $6.15. For the full year, we expect free cash flow conversions to be above 100% of adjusted income. A couple of items not shown here, we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $70 million for the full year. Also, we now expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 129.5 million, that\u2019s about 1.5 million shares higher than the November guidance. We continue to expect to spend about $400 million on repurchases this year but the share prices increased.","Before I turn it over to Patrick to begin our Q&A session, as Blake noted, this will be my final earnings call as CFO. I\u2019d just like to say that it has been an honor to be the Chief Financial Officer at Rockwell Automation. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a lot easier job when you\u2019re representing a great company with such great culture and such great people. I\u2019m really pleased to have Patrick Goris succeed me as CFO. Most of you have gotten to known him over the past few years in his industrial relations role. He has a great breadth of financial management experience across our different businesses and functions. He\u2019s very well prepared for this and I know he\u2019s going to do a great job.","I\u2019ve really enjoyed the CFO role in the past 10 years. Part of that was the opportunity to interact with all of you, the analysts and the investors. I learned a lot from your questions, the challenges and sometimes your different views on the industry and the company. I\u2019m excited to be moving back to an operating role where I think I can make a different contribution [indiscernible]. I won\u2019t be interacting with this group as often going forward, but if not before then, I look forward to seeing many of you at the next Automation Fair. And since this is my last earnings call, I expect you all to take it easy on me in Q&A.","So thank you and over to you, Patrick.","Patrick Goris ","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. As usual, Blake and Ted will handle the Q&A today. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And first today is Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Scott Davis","Good morning guys and Ted, we\u2019re going to miss you but I must say on behalf of shareholders, we\u2019re happy you\u2019re not retiring and at least Rockwell\u2019s not losing you altogether. So thankfully you\u2019re staying on board so best of luck to you. It\u2019s been a pleasure.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Scott Davis","And I know Patrick will do a great job, but anyway, I\u2019m intrigued by your comment about capital spending I mean when I think about the world, people struggle with the concept of new capacity just given how limited growth is out there. But what are people spending money on I mean if you could generalize? Are we going back into the existing factory stock and upgrading? Is it the supply chain? Is it distribution? I mean what\u2019s your sense of - if capital spending is coming back, what people actually are spending money on?","Blake Moret","I think it\u2019s primarily around increased productivity and as we\u2019ve seen a lot of people implement the first waves of productivity in terms of just basic automation replacing hardwire control, the next wave in many cases involves the integration of that basic control and information. So taking advantage of the basic data that\u2019s part of their production processes and integrating the information software and the analytics so that operators could make better decisions about the manufacturing processes.","Ted Crandall","Scott, I think too in this quarter from a vertical perspective, the acceleration we saw was largely in consumer and transportation.","Scott Davis","Okay. And just Ted, you commented on spending will go up as Rockwell going through a \u2013 compensation, accruals and stuff like that. But what explicitly do you feel like you need to spend money on? Is it few capacity on your own? Have you been under-investing at all, just give us a little color on that.","Ted Crandall","Yeah I mean I think the spending is more. It\u2019s not so much about capacity and supply chain. The spending is going to be more about R&D and commercial expenses and very much targeted some of the new opportunities we have related to connective enterprise.","Scott Davis","Okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. you guys have done a great job and it\u2019s been a pleasure, so good luck to you Ted.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","John Inch ","Thanks. Good morning everyone.","Ted Crandall","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, Ted. Patrick, congratulations. So first question China up mid-teens that has been running down. China has sort of been this tail for Rockwell kind of two halves right? The consumer piece up there very strongly and then the heavy industry piece down a lot. What happened in China in the quarter? Did the consumer get even stronger or did heavy industry revert? You talked about some \u2013 could you just provide a little more color please? And is it sustainable really?","Ted Crandall","And the first thing I would say is we mentioned that there were some pool-ins, we think there were some pool-ins of jobs we expected to hit later in the year, that was true in Asia generally, but particularly in China. I would say the vertical profile that we experienced most of last year which was strength particularly in consumer to a lesser extent in transportation and weakness in heavy industry, that continued but we had particularly strong quarter entire in China. Heavy industry was better although still weaker and I don\u2019t think -- we do not expect China to be 15% growth for the full year. We still think for the full year an expectation of something in the mid-single digits is appropriate.","John Inch","So it sounds like Ted, based on your commentary, this is may be more Rockwell specific rebound versus a China market rebound? I mean \u2013 talked up China, some other companies have talked up Parker sort of talked about China rebound a little bit and some of the heavier stuff. Are you suggesting that this is a pull-forward initiatives you were working on, I mean how much is Rockwell versus how much you think is sort of market in the fourth quarter for China?","Ted Crandall","I\u2019m not sure I know exactly how to quantify that, but my guess would be may be half of the growth in the quarter was kind of pool-ins and unique to Rockwell projects. And the other half was kind of underlying market.","Blake Moret","Strong parts of the China market are playing to our strengths.","John Inch","Yeah, absolutely. Makes sense. Can we then, just as my follow up, can you please talk about your export versus import position? We know kind of had a very sort of high level what your situation is in Mexico. Obviously we\u2019re going to wait to see sort of what Trump does, but could you just talk about sort of - again export versus import position in United States? And then your own thoughts toward repurposing perhaps some of the production say in Monterrey or whatever, back to the U.S. or alternative sourcing, anything you could add at this point would be helpful. Thank you.","Ted Crandall","Yeah, so may be just to start with little context. We\u2019re a U.S. based company, but we serve a global customer sect and our global supply chain has been constructed to serve those customers all around the world. Today, we are a net importer into the U.S., but I think it\u2019s very important to note that we\u2019ve got flexibility in our global supply chain and we believe we could make adjustments if there were changes in the tax law that made that appropriate.","John Inch","That\u2019s it?","Ted Crandall","Yes.","John Inch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is Dan on for Steve. Just wondering if you can give us some color on how the quarter looks from a monthly perspective? Did they get better as you moved along? And then how has January started off? Are you seeing kind of a similar environment or a step up or down in activity?","Ted Crandall","Dan, I would say that the quarter played out in a pretty typical fashion which is it started a little bit slower and then picked up as we moved through the quarter. I would say may be the only unusual thing in the quarter was, a last couple of weeks in December were stronger than normal and it\u2019s the reason that we think there might have been a little bit of budget flush particularly in North America. January has started off slowly as a typical January, but things have picked up a little bit as the month is going on.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And then just as a quick follow up, what was auto for you guys in the quarter, I guess both globally and do you have any color on strength by region?","Ted Crandall","So auto was up over 10% in the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next we have Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Nigel Coe ","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Nice strong quarter. You mentioned some budget flush between North America, what do you think caused that? Why would we have seen that budget flush in December? And on top of that, what do we see in your channel inventories specifically within North America?","Ted Crandall","So Nigel I\u2019m not sure I know I don\u2019t know that we know what caused the budget flush. We heard that comment from several of our distributors and we also observed that there was a little bit higher than normal order rate in those last couple of weeks in December, that\u2019s why we\u2019re speculating that there may have been some higher than normal budget flush. In terms of distributor inventories, particularly in North America, we have very good visibility on that and distributor inventories were up slightly from September.","Nigel Coe ","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the segment margin guidance for FY17, didn\u2019t change obviously there\u2019s a squiggle in front of the number, but you\u2019ve given the higher organic growth and given the strong incremental margins in A&S, would have expected to see a slightly better or slightly higher segment margins guidance. Is there any change in the way you\u2019re planning the year between CPS and A&S or are there some offsets in FX and\/or comps that we should consider?","Ted Crandall","I think it\u2019s more about the latter. I mean basically we\u2019ve got more currency headwind now, top-line and bottom-line as a consequence of what\u2019s happened with exchange rate. There were also the higher spending in the latter half of the year, some of that is just a ketchup from under-spending in Q1, but we also believe we\u2019re going to spend a little bit more in total for the year now consistent with higher organic growth. And then incentive comp will also be higher as a consequence of higher organic growth and higher EPS.","Nigel Coe ","Okay, that\u2019s clear. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Good morning guys.","Ted Crandall","Good morning.","Blake Moret","Good morning.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Congratulations Ted and Patrick, Ted glad -- to be around we\u2019ll see you at Automation Fair. Relative to that, the last few Automation Fairs at least the last couple, it seems like Blake you\u2019ve had a lot of these productivity solutions that you\u2019re talking about you\u2019ve offered customers, but may be adoption wasn\u2019t great because there wasn\u2019t a lot of business confidence out there. I mean have you heard in the last couple of months a change in tone from your customers, has there been sort of better follow-on to Automation Fair than we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in terms of people\u2019s willingness to adopt these sort of productivity related solutions that you\u2019re offering.","Blake Moret","Yeah, the progress is still relatively slow and of course, customers are in different stages in their journey as they begin to adopt some of our new solutions. But it starts with having the foundation placed with smart products. And so we do think that customers are getting that message as they know they have to have the data at the foundation of their manufacturing process to be able to do something with it. The pilot projects that we\u2019ve been running, I think have become a little more formalized over the last few months, we\u2019re getting better at it. Our customers are understanding the process and so we have a large number of engagements that are just moving through the pipeline and we\u2019re happy with that progress and some of the increased spending is going to acceleration of those activities.","Ted Crandall ","Shannon I also think when we debriefed our sales organization this quarter, we did hear kind of a more positive sentiment both from our own sales people and from the channel that would have been the case six months ago.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the oil and gas piece, given kind of the upstream waiting of your business and things, I mean almost think you\u2019re starting to see a little bit more improvement there than you need to be indicating. Any change in activity that you\u2019re seeing there or when would you expect I know you\u2019re kind of still assuming it\u2019s flattish, but anything on the margin that you\u2019re seeing improving there? Any reason that you wouldn\u2019t expect your business to kind of turn with an improvement in some of the U.S. upstream activity?","Ted Crandall","After the last two years, what we\u2019ve experienced the last couple quarters is getting close to flat year-over-year, that feels pretty good actually. We do think there\u2019s potential for some improvement as we move through this year, but for the full year, we still think it\u2019s going to be close to flat.","Blake Moret","The sentiment in heavy industries in general is a little bit more positive but when that\u2019s actually going to turn into orders and shipments, these are longer term projects. Oil and gas continued strong in Latin America but for the rest of the world, we\u2019re still not seeing that manifest itself in sharply increased orders.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Congrats.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen and congratulations, Ted and Patrick.","Ted Crandall","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Just to the A&S business, wondering if you could comment on A&S U.S. performance in the quarter specifically and whether it was different than kind of the modest increase in total U.S. that we saw on a [indiscernible] basis?","Ted Crandall","The A&S business in Q1 was pretty similar to the balance of the company in Q1. It was strong growth.","Jeffrey Sprague ","And the A&S margins Ted, did they not have the incentive comp pressure that CP&S did or it was just overwhelmed by the volume leverage in the mix and therefore it wasn\u2019t apparent?","Ted Crandall","You\u2019re exactly right. I mean the year-over-year margin impact of incentive comp was pretty similar in the two segments, with almost 8% organic growth in A&S, it just got us swamped that impact.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Right. And just wondering if you could step back perhaps just play big picture on automotive - automation obviously there\u2019s a lot going on in Washington D.C. Any auto plan I believe is pretty highly automated these days. But is the, for a lack of a better term, is the Rockwell calorie count likely to be higher in a U.S. automotive plant than it is say in a Mexican automotive plant? And how would you think about that, how would you frame that to us?","Blake Moret","So I think that\u2019s a fair assumption that as U.S. manufacturers increase or as manufacturers increase their U.S. footprint, it\u2019s going to be done with a higher relative content of advanced manufacturing. And that\u2019s great for us. We have of course a very large market share particularly in that industry and so anything that encourages increased manufacturing in the U.S. is a good thing for Rockwell automation given our footprint. And that impact on sales is something that has us very optimistic and talking to customers about what additionally we can do to help them as they make those decisions to increase their footprint here in the country.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Now I know rule of thumbs are dangerous, but if we thought about a typical auto plant that maybe it\u2019s 200,000 or 300,000 units plant, can you give us some idea of what you think the revenue upside in the U.S. versus some other market might be kind of a percentage terms or index or whatever kind of framework you might want to give us?","Blake Moret","I think it depends on a lot of factors of course and in terms of when that plays out for us, timing is a big issue, but if you look at some of the numbers that were published for instance with the recent board plan and you can look at the labor differences between what they were going to employ outside of the U.S. versus their expectations for new jobs in the U.S., you can\u2019t apply that linearly to the increased dollar count for Rockwell, but it gives you some idea of an order of magnitude.","Jeffrey Sprague ","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Eastman","Yes, good morning and congrats on a nice quarter and good luck Ted and Patrick for that matter.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Richard Eastman","Just very quickly on the CP&S segment margins, Ted could you may be run through that a little bit. I think what\u2019s kind of noticeable here is on the sales growth our incremental or decremental margin here is almost a 100%. And I\u2019m curious, I realized Maverick comes in a lower margin, but is that business losing money? And then also, if not, is the margin on the core CP&S business is that lower than historic norms?","Ted Crandall","Well, so couple of things, first Maverick will not lose money, so we\u2019re not expecting in the first year for both purchase accounting and integration cost that we\u2019ll get a significant profit contribution from those sales. On the CP&S core, I don\u2019t think I would say this performance was significantly worse than historic results, but I would say if we\u2019re going to have some margin pressure in this business compared to last year, I mean we had a particularly good margin performance last year, that included some higher margin project business that isn\u2019t going to repeat this year. And as we progress through the year with downturns and heavy industry and the pressure, we\u2019ve got some lower margin projects in the backlog they\u2019re going to work their way out this year as a consequence of some more aggressive pricing. So we\u2019re going to have some margin pressure in that business this year. I think that our full year margins will be a little bit lower than last year, but I don\u2019t expect them to get worse as we proceed through the year compared to the first quarter.","Richard Eastman","Thank you. And just a follow up question, Blake you had noted in the press release this issue of investing a bit more in the business given the fast start on the core growth. Could you may be just define that in terms of dollars Ted, pre-tax, I mean are we talking about $0.05 or $0.10 per share and hence again the full year outlook \u2013 adjusted EPS outlook may be only going up a dime we\u2019ve got negative currency there and is there another 5% to 10% -- $0.05 to $0.10 of incremental investments?","Ted Crandall","See may be think about it this way, there\u2019s probably about $10 million that we under-spent in Q1 that we\u2019re going to catch up on now in the balance of the year and compared to our previous guidance, there\u2019s another incremental $10 million that we now expect to spend.","Richard Eastman","Okay. Okay, very good and good luck again. Thank you.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Ted Crandall","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","Congratulations Ted and Patrick.","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a question, as we look at software sales at Rockwell and specifically software excluding embedded software. Could you share what kind of growth you are seeing in the channel and what are the trends, what are the customers asking for?","Blake Moret","So if we look at the information solutions then we\u2019re seeing double digit growth in that area. So this is the MES solutions, this is the modular software, this is where our new analytic offerings would be. And so, that\u2019s part of the information solutions and connected services which we\u2019re expecting double digit growth in.","Andrew Obin","And when you say double-digit, is it low-teens, high-teens, just sort of ballpark?","Ted Crandall","I think you can think of that for this year it\u2019s kind of low-to-mid teens","Andrew Obin","Thank you. And just to follow up on Jeff\u2019s question on what -- can you give us some color just general post the election, what kind of conversations are you having with customers, what industries are the most interested in talking to you in putting capacity in North America because you guys probably are the cutting edge of what\u2019s happening on the kind of conversations people are having?","Blake Moret","I think a lot of the early conversations are around discrete manufacturing or batch so again, it\u2019s right in our wheelhouse in consumer and transportation. And there\u2019s some obvious things that we can do to help those manufacturers ensure that they have the labor that\u2019s ready to address the advance manufacturing technology, that\u2019s a big issue for manufacturers particularly if they deferred those investments in automation for some time. So we\u2019re well positioned to be able to offer to enable that workforce and then when they need additional sources of labor to augment their own existing workforce, then we have a lot of solutions there. And so we\u2019re actively engaged with those manufacturers to be able to put specific new proposals in place on top of what we already offer them.","Andrew Obin","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning and congrats I\u2019ll echo everybody\u2019s comments. So just may be going, covered a lot of ground but going back to your comment that larger projects were pull forward, larger projects at the end of the year were pulled forward in terms of your expectations. Can you maybe expand on that a little bit? I know there\u2019s only a certain level of visibility given the nature of the business, what makes you believe that there\u2019s not something behind that as well and what kind of projects we\u2019re talking about?","Ted Crandall","Well I mean the larger projects pulled forward primarily occurred in Asia-Pacific, it was kind of a combination of cross vertical as it affected both transportation and heavy industry, semi-conductor was one of those. Look Steve, if I had to estimate, I would estimate that our organic growth in the first quarter between project pull forwards and potential budget flush, may be 1 point of the organic growth was related to that. And even if you take that out, this was still a better quarter than we expected.","Steven Winoker","Okay, okay. And then as we think about your $20 million or so of spending in how things are going to layer in through the year as well as kind of growth. Normally, in terms of seasonality I might start to look at the Q2 being may be a little more challenging, but you have this acceleration and then you have a very strong back half now. Can you may be comment on how you think we should or how we should think about kind of layering into seasonality given the commentary you\u2019ve had?","Ted Crandall","Well I think there are two things you ought to think about, one is our normal merit increases occur basically effective January 1st across the company and so sequentially, there will be a step-up in spending probably about $10 million on a sequentially quarterly basis, it\u2019s just a consequence of that merit increase. And then in addition to that, you\u2019ll start to see us ramp what I would call more underlying spending and I think that will ramp as we proceed through the year, so probably a little lower in Q2 and a little bit higher in Q3 and Q4.","Steven Winoker","And then but from a growth perspective as well as you\u2019re thinking about that step up in organic growth, is this something you think about kind of natural year-on-year acceleration each quarter from here?","Ted Crandall","I think on sales, you\u2019ll see some increase from Q1 but not a lot of sequential growth in Q2, Q3 then you ought to expect kind of a step-up in Q4 which is typical for us on a seasonal basis.","Steven Winoker","Great. Helpful. And I guess one more thing Ted, in your response to John\u2019s comments about being a net importer, I think it\u2019s probably we kind of know that you\u2019re a net importer, the question is more about size. We\u2019re talking about low hundreds of millions not something more than that or the possibility\u2026","Ted Crandall","That\u2019s correct. We think we\u2019re probably about $250 million in net importer.","Steven Winoker","Okay. Thanks so much. Good luck. Look forward to our next conversation. Bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Richard Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Congrats, Patrick, Ted. Look forward to working with you in your new capacities. Two questions, quick ones. So, on the change to the organic growth outlook the 100 basis point improvement, how would you segment that between heavy industry may be a little bit better versus automotive and consumer coming in better than expected because I know you put some guidelines out there underpinning the growth act in November and it looks like at least this quarter both of those areas came in better. So how should we think about that?","Ted Crandall","Rich, I think it\u2019s fair to think about that increase as primarily transportation and consumer.","Richard Kwas","Okay. And then based on what you\u2019re seeing right now on heavy industry flattish which is a little bit better than flat to down, but need to see more evidence of order improvement to get constructive?","Ted Crandall","I think that\u2019s fair. I mean I think Blake mentioned earlier, we\u2019re hearing some better things about potential investment in heavy industry, but we\u2019re not seeing it translate into orders yet.","Richard Kwas","Okay. And then just a quick one, Ted, on free cash flow there\u2019s a plus sign in that 100%, now seasonally speaking, you did pretty well this quarter on conversion, anything puts and takes what we should think about the balance of the year as we try to model this out?","Ted Crandall","The only thing I would remind you of is because there were no incentive compensation earned last year, there was no payout this year either in the first quarter or in the balance of the year. So, that\u2019s going to contribute somewhat to a better conversion on the year. That\u2019s probably the most important thing.","Richard Kwas","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow up on auto and consumer, are you still thinking mid-singles for the year growth\u2026?","Ted Crandall","Yeah I would say may be now it\u2019s mid-to-high singles.","Richard Kwas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Robert McCarthy","Yeah I\u2019ll echo all the comments Ted and Patrick and I\u2019ll also remind you the importance of comparers and remember Patrick you were a very tough comparer and Ted I think you had a very interesting compare. So anyway, congratulations. Alright, moving over from the ridiculous to the sublime, clearly you talked about the budget flush and the reacceleration and underlying growth and the pace of business. This has been kind of talked about with the several other analysts in the call, but could you just comment across the board how you\u2019re feeling about the front log, are you seeing a change in the pace of business? You talked about the budget flush but could you talk anything about January trends, anything about just kind of the current state of what you\u2019re seeing? And are you seeing a change in the underlying psychology association with business with the change of administrations?","Ted Crandall","I think it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s a general optimism but front log is flat and it\u2019s still early in the year. Our backlog overall is up a little bit and \u2013 positive signs. Importantly, we\u2019re releasing new products and that has an impact as well, but it\u2019s still early to call this a different trajectory in terms of the outlined months.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. And then obviously I think John asked a series of intrigue questions, he may have covered this, but what I would ask is may be just talk about the prospect for cash repatriation, the uses of cash, the M&A environment, how you\u2019re looking at that, that kind of old chestnut","Ted Crandall","Yeah, so it\u2019s I think we\u2019re encouraged by some of the things that are being talked about around U.S. corporate tax rate and house proposal that\u2019s been put out there we think addresses a number of important issues that currently created disadvantage for U.S. based companies, a lot of corporate tax rate, territorial tax system, potential to repatriate foreign earnings. We view all of those as positive for Rockwell for U.S. manufacturers and for U.S. economic growth generally. Specifically as it relates to repatriation, what we would repatriate ultimately would depend on the rate -- the tax rate that would apply to that and any conditions that might apply to the repatriation. But we probably currently have about $2 billion that could be repatriated at some point. Those funds if repatriated, could be used for investments in organic growth, they could be used for acquisitions especially U.S. based companies, it could be used for retirement of debt or better funding of our pension plans, or to return to shareowners through dividend repurchases. And once we get a clearer view on what the conditions might be, we\u2019ll be prepared to talk in a little more detail about specifically about how we would use it.","Robert McCarthy","Just one follow up with a M&A question, do you think it\u2019s a better environment now for M&A just given the standpoint of perhaps optimism and of reacceleration of the underlying cycle and may be the ability to stomach some valuations in that context? I mean do you think there\u2019s been a change in the psychology around M&A for you at all?","Ted Crandall","We haven\u2019t passed on attractive acquisitions in the past for a lack of U.S. cash. We continue to look at acquisitions as opportunities to accelerate what we\u2019re doing in terms of technology, domain expertise to market access. And we\u2019re pleased with the results of our recent acquisition, we\u2019ll talk more about the need to be present in M&A to accelerate our strategy, so I don\u2019t really see it as a significant accelerator to the amount of M&A we would otherwise do.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for Julian Mitchell. As a follow up for the M&A question, can you just talk about the M&A pipeline right now and touch on any specific end markets or geographic regions that look particularly attractive right now?","Ted Crandall","I think if you were to look at where the concentration of our activity is, it\u2019s really in that the new value that come from information solutions and connected services. So in the network space, in the software space it sits up above the real-time control, those are the areas where we\u2019re probably relatively active and it\u2019s spread across the world, it\u2019s not constrained to any one geography.","Unidentified Analyst","Understood. And could you just quantify the impact of incentive comp on CP&S margins for the quarter please?","Ted Crandall","It was approximately one point.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you very much for your time.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Joe Ritchie ","Thanks. Good morning everyone and congratulations, Ted and Patrick. My first question is really on pricing, you guys have done a great job on continuing to get price through this malaise that we\u2019ve been in the last couple of years. Just wondering if we do see this CapEx acceleration, is there an opportunity for you to get greater than point in price or how does that -- how do you guys foresee that?","Ted Crandall","Joe, I think what\u2019s reflected in our current guidance is what we talked about in November which we think for the full year price will be little less than a point and similar to what it was last year. If the economy heats up, who knows, I mean maybe pricing could be a little better.","Joe Ritchie ","Okay. And I guess maybe I guess along those lines, if things were to heat up and just along the lines of your guidance and the higher end of that range getting to 5% growth, what would have to happen for us to get to that higher end of the range? And then if we do get towards the higher end of the range, what kind of incremental would you expect to see across the business because historically they\u2019ve been a lot higher than your gross margins?","Ted Crandall","So in answering the first question which is about the top-line, I mean may be the way to think about the higher end of the range is, clearly, we had a better organic growth result in Q2 than we were expecting coming into the year. But basically, we have not changed our balance of the year guidance. So if Q2 is truly kind of a new baseline, and we should expect the same sequential growth we were originally expecting in the November guidance, that\u2019s a way to think about how we would get to the higher end of the range on the top-line. Our conversion now in the new guidance is about 20% which is almost double what it was in our November guidance and that\u2019s the spike the headwinds we talked about November around incentive compensation and pension in particular. So, there will be some better conversion at the higher end than we would see at the low end or midpoint.","Joe Ritchie ","Okay, fair enough. May be in fact sneak one more in there, going back to the question we had on the repatriation, I guess Ted when you think about bringing in cash back, I mean it feels like today company is a facing a little bit of a conundrum in that, valuations are really high from an M&A perspective, stocks are hitting all-time highs. How do you think about the allocation of capital if you are able to bring back overseas cash? And then, specifically, do you need to invest internally if we do accelerate from a CapEx standpoint?","Ted Crandall","One of the things we\u2019ve always talked about is we\u2019re not all that capital intensive as it relates to growth. With immediate deductibility of CapEx, is it possible we might spend more than we originally planned, I think it\u2019s possible but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very big number particularly compared to the amount of earnings we\u2019ve got sitting overseas.","Blake Moret","The bigger impact would be the increased sales for our more capital intensive customers.","Joe Ritchie ","That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Blake Moret","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning guys, Ted and Patrick congratulations.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Solutions and services, they were down 14% last quarter, I think you said down 1% this quarter and you mentioned previously that the business may stay negative in the first half of \u201817 but based on what you\u2019re seeing, you mentioned the strong bookings in the quarter. Is any of the improvement there timing, can it be up now sequentially going forward in that business?","Ted Crandall","Well I mean I would love to think that we\u2019re going to start to see some improvement in heavy industries as we proceed through the year. But we haven\u2019t seen that yet and it\u2019s not reflected in the guidance. I mean I think our solutions and services business right now we believe will be about flat year-over-year and any improvement that does start to occur in heavy industry, for a significant part of that business, we really need to see it in Q2 or may be early Q3 in order for that to have an impact on shipments in the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks for that. And then Blake, you mentioned that you had a slow start in EMEA this year as expected. Last quarter, you talked about strong orders in the region, I think it was up mid-single digits, it didn\u2019t seem like last quarter\u2019s orders translated but you did talk about improving from here. So did you see any actual weakening in any part of EMEA and specifically in the Middle East, how is that region doing?","Blake Moret","So for EMEA overall, the orders were actually up, they were up year-over-year and sequentially and we do expect the result for the full year to be growth in EMEA.","Ted Crandall","I think the Q1 performance in EMEA was just more about timing of when projects hit, principally in the solutions and services businesses.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks guys.","Patrick Goris","Operator, we will take one more question.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Eli Lustgarten","Thank you. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and my congratulations to both of you.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Eli Lustgarten","Just a quick clarification, the shipments that were brought forth in the first quarter, was it all A&S and would it b added in the second quarter or was it spread out over the year?","Ted Crandall","So I would say it was primarily advanced into the second quarter and it was not all A&S it was kind of a combination of A&S and CP&S.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. And so, we understand the weakness in margins that we saw in with control solutions business, but A&S had a very strong margin I suspect that with \u2013 brought forth, [indiscernible] and I suspected it to be sustained at that level and expected to be off a little bit\u2026","Ted Crandall","That\u2019s correct, we do not expect A&S margin at 30% for the balance of the year, we expect lower margins for A&S for the balance of the year.","Eli Lustgarten","And one final, one of the things we heard from a lot of companies you saw the Trump Bump I guess it\u2019s what referred to these days. But we\u2019re hearing from a lot of companies particularly in the heavy industries, of an almost wait and see for spending they talk a lot wait and see for spending to see what policies really because not much can change in the first half of the year. Are you hearing any of that from your customers, that there\u2019s a lot of talk but more excited about \u201818 spending than \u201817 spending at this point?","Blake Moret","I have not heard specifically that people are waiting to \u201818 but I do believe as we are before we make specific changes in any plants, we want to see what actual changes to various elements of tax code or rather incentives might be. So I think that is a fair characterization.","Ted Crandall","Eli, maybe it\u2019s a little bit different approach to the answer and this is not intended in any way to be a political commentary, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re hearing anything from investors that would cause us to believe that what we saw as the acceleration in the first quarter is related to upcoming potential tax changes.","Eli Lustgarten","Okay. Thank you very much and congratulations to both of you.","Patrick Goris","Thank you, Eli.","Ted Crandall","Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Okay. That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Rondi Rohr-Dralle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Rohr-Dralle, please go ahead.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Thank you, Quanda. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2012 Earnings Release Conference Call. Our results were released this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Please note that both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures. Additionally, a webcast of this call is accessible now at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO; and Ted Crandall, our Chief Financial Officer. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith that will include highlights on the company's performance in the first quarter and some full year outlook commentary. Then Ted will provide more details around the first quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2012. We'll take questions at the end of Ted's remarks.","We know this will be a busy earnings day for all of you. I'm sure it's been a busy couple of weeks already. So we'll try and get through the call in less than an hour today. As is always the case on these calls, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I appreciate your time and interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to page 4 in the slide deck.","Quarter 1 was a story of great earnings growth on good but uneven sales results. On the sales front, in a continued uncertain global environment, we were pleased with 8% year-over-year organic growth. But there were mixed results by region. Europe, the region you might expect to be the weakest, was strong. And Asia, the region you would expect to be strong, was the weakest. I believe that during this period of moderating sales growth rates, we will continue to see mixed growth rates by region, as uncertain economic conditions, solutions, lumpiness and prior year comparisons have a greater impact on growth rates. ","Earnings per share in the quarter increased 22% compared to Q1 last year, which is pretty remarkable given sales growth of 8%. Don't expect earnings conversion that strong every quarter, but we'll take credit for it this time. And return on invested capital, on an after-tax basis, continues to be very strong at 31.5%. On balance, I call it a very good start to the fiscal year. That was a quick summary. ","So let me share some highlights of the quarter, a few other highlights of the quarter. It was another great quarter in Latin America. The team there continues to successfully execute our growth and performance strategy, mining and oil and gas opportunities remain strong, and we are on track to start up production at our new facility in Brazil in the fourth quarter. In spite of deteriorating economic conditions, we had 13% sales growth in EMEA in quarter 1. About 4 points of this growth is from our recent acquisitions, which are performing well. We continue to see a divergence in the economic climate between Northern and Southern Europe, but we are well positioned throughout the region to outperform the underlying markets. ","On the other side of the coin, Asia sales were flat in the quarter. Some of that was due to tough comps from quarter 1 last year and some from the hole that we dug in our solutions business with the great fourth quarter that we put on the board. ","In emerging Asia, in quarter 1, inflation concerns and liquidity issues dampened investment. However, quarter growth in the quarter outpaced sales growth, and we did build backlog in our solutions businesses. We are optimistic that China and India will take action to stimulate growth in the remainder of the year. So even though underlying growth rates have slowed, we remain confident that over the long term, emerging Asia will be the highest growth automation market, and we will continue to invest there. ","I was really pleased to see 22% growth in process this quarter. We are gaining traction with PlantPAx and are winning larger process orders across a broad spectrum of applications in all regions. Process remains our greatest growth opportunity and we are executing well. ","Orders were very good in the quarter, and the book to bill in our solutions business was almost 1.3. I don't talk to investors a lot about our operations and engineering services organization, but they are doing a great job. We have a number of metrics to assess their performance on dimensions like on-time delivery, productivity and quality, and they are delivering on all fronts. ","I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their contributions to improving our customer's experience, which leads directly to higher levels of customer loyalty. And customer loyalty is one of the most important measures of our success.","Let me share our thoughts on the remainder of the year. The global economic picture is still cloudy. Economic indicators in the U.S. are mixed and forecasts for Europe are deteriorating. Growth rates in the emerging markets are moderating. Customers\u2019 CapEx spending plans vary widely across industries and regions. Despite this uncertainty, we expect the recovery to continue in 2012. We feel great about our market position and our growth opportunities, and we will continue to invest in innovation and differentiation. ","With one quarter behind us, and given our current assessment of global economic conditions, we are not changing our sales outlook for the year. Based on fiscal 2012 projected sales of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion, we are reaffirming fiscal 2012 earnings per share guidance of $5.05 to $5.45. Although we may see uneven results throughout the year, sales and earnings in our guidance range would represent another record year for the company. ","I'd like to close by thanking all of the employees and partners of Rockwell Automation. I am pleased by how well our ecosystem, that is our partners, businesses, functions, regions and cultures, how they all come together to serve our customers and deliver great business performance. We know how to be flexible and collaborative and responsive to customer needs. That is what will enable us to grow and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2012. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith. Good morning, everybody. My comments will reference the slides that have been posted to the website. So I'll start with Slide #5, which is the Q1 results summary.","Revenue in the quarter was $1,474,000,000, as Keith noted, up 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency fluctuations reduced sales by about 1 point, and we experienced about a 1 point contribution from acquisitions. ","Segment operating earnings were $284 million, an increase of 28% compared to $222 million a year ago. General corporate net expense was $20.9 million compared to $15.7 million in Q1 last year. General Corporate net expense was lower in the first quarter of last year, primarily due to the sale of an investment. ","The effective tax rate in the quarter was 24.5%. Diluted earnings per share was $1.27, a 22% increase compared to $1.04 last year. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was $143.9 million. And we purchased approximately 122,000 shares in the first quarter at a cost of about $8 million.","Moving to Slide 6. This is the total company results for the first quarter. As I noted on the prior slide, the year-over-year sales increase in Q1 was 8%. Sales declined sequentially by 11%. Currency translation accounted for about 2 points of that sequential decline. ","It's pretty typical for us to experience a sequential decline from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but the 9% decline excluding currency is more significant than usual. We had unusually strong sales in the fourth quarter, particularly in the solutions businesses. And as we've discussed at the last earnings call, and as Keith mentioned, that created something of a hole in shipments for us in the first quarter. ","If you eliminate the currency impact and normalize Q1 for the unusually strong fourth quarter shipments, you get to a more typical sequential decline. ","Moving to the earnings side of the chart, a very significant improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expanded by 3 points. The margin improvement reflects a very strong contribution from volume leverage. We also experienced lower performance-based compensation expense year-over-year. We talked about the tailwind from that when we provided guidance in November. We realized a modest positive impact from price, pretty much as we expected. And these improvements were partially offset by increased spending. ","Conversion margins for the quarter was 57%, and that's extraordinarily good. But to echo Keith's comments, don't get too excited, this is likely to be the best quarter of the year for conversion margin. As we expected, lower performance-based compensation expense helped to boost the conversion margin. But also, in the first quarter, currency effects improved conversion margin. Currency caused a 1-point sales decline but with a small positive net operating earnings contribution. ","The quarterly earnings impact of currency variations can be very variable, and this was an unusually good quarter. You might recall, we had a couple of quarters last year where currency was a drag on our conversion performance. ","Spending didn\u2019t increase at the rate that we had reflected in our guidance. That was another important factor in the conversion performance. And for the balance of the year, we're expecting lower conversion margin based on increased spending, less favorable mix going forward and a more typical impact from currency effects. On a different note, though it's not displayed on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 31.5%. ","Now please turn to Slide 7, which summarizes the Q1 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales increased 6% year-over-year. Currency translation reduced sales by 1 point. Sales were down 5% sequentially, but currency accounted for about 2 points of that decline. ","Operating margins for the quarter was 28.6%. That's up 3.7 points from Q1 last year, a very strong incremental margin performance, basically reflecting the items that I discussed on the previous slide, but also a more favorable sales mix in this segment compared to fourth -- first quarter last year. ","The next slide, 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Sales in the quarter were up 10% compared to last year. The increase included about 2 points of contribution from acquisitions, offset by about 1 point reduction due to currency. The product portion of Control Products & Solutions grew year-over-year at about the same rate as the Architecture & Software segment. The solutions and services businesses grew about 11%, excluding currency and acquisitions. ","Sales declined 15% sequentially, about 2 points due to currency, and with solutions and services declining substantially more than products as expected given the very high solutions shipments in the fourth quarter of last year. Segment operating earnings increased 42% year-over-year with a related 2.6 point improvement in operating margin.","Switching to the next slide, this provides a geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, excluding currency effects. ","A very good growth in the U.S. and Canada at 8% and 11%, respectively, and continued high growth in Latin America at 14%. EMEA came in at 13%, that would be 9% excluding acquisitions. And this was the only region significantly affected by acquisitions this quarter. And then very unusual to see Asia basically flat year-over-year. ","Looking across the regions. I think it would be fair to say that Canada and EMEA outperformed expectations in Q1; EMEA especially, given the macro economic challenges in that market, and Asia Pacific underperformed. Keith talked about some of the reasons for the underperformance in his comments. Maybe the one thing I would reinforce is that we do expect to see improvement in Asia Pacific sales performance in the balance of the year, and in the longer term, we continue to believe that the emerging markets in Asia remain one of our best growth opportunities.","I'll turn now to Slide 10, free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of cash of $211 million that included a $300 million pretax discretionary contribution to our U.S. pension trust. Q1 is typically a weaker cash flow quarter. First quarter this year was particularly low due to the pension contribution and the payout of a larger-than-normal performance-based compensation that was earned and expensed in the last fiscal year. You can see that impact in the compensation and benefits line on this statement. ","Despite the slow start in Q1, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of about 75% for the full year, including the impact of the discretionary pension contribution, and we would expect conversion to be about 100%, excluding the pension contribution. ","And that takes us to the final slide, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '12. As Keith mentioned, we're reaffirming guidance. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.5 billion. Excluding currency effects, that revenue range represents growth for the full year of between 5% and 9%. We expect currency to reduce growth by about 1 point for the full year. That's the same as our previous guidance. However, if rates remain and if currency rates remain at the current level for the balance of the year, we have some risk to the sales outlook. ","In that case, we would expect to face an additional sales headwind of about one more point. We still expect segment margin to be about 18%, and we expect diluted EPS in the range of $5.05 to $5.45. We continue to expect a full year tax rate of about 24%. And finally, we continue to expect General Corporate net expense to be about $86 million for the full year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Rondi.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great, Ted, thanks. [Operator Instructions] So Quanda, I will turn it over to you to open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Inch with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm wondering, is there a way we could quantify the impact of lower comp expense this quarter versus last year? I'm not sure if this -- Ted, you could put some sort of numbers around that.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. I mean, you might remember in November we talked about that being a $50 million tailwind for the year. And I would say the first quarter was reasonably represented with that full year result.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So like, is the first quarter disproportionately high versus the year or you just divide the $50 million by 4?","Theodore D. Crandall","I think it's pretty close to dividing the $50 million by 4.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So your commentary, Ted or Keith, about expecting lower profit conversion, why again is that likely to be realized? I mean, you've got kind of the impact of the price, and assuming solutions don't have the sort of air pocket necessarily or the benefit -- the impact of the air pocket is going to get kind of less over the course of the year, why do profit conversions then -- I realize it\u2019s a high number but is there something else that is obvious here?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, no, I would say I talked about this a little bit in my comments, John. But it is basically, going forward, we would expect less favorable mix. We think we\u2019ll have a richer solutions content in sales going forward. We do expect to ramp up spending. And we got a little bit of a slow start in that regard in Q1, so we think it's going to ramp -- likely ramp at a rate that exceeds the sales growth as we go forward. We think we're going to have a less favorable currency result in the future quarters as well. And then the last factor, I think, would be that our merit increase will kick in beginning in January.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That make sense. But can I ask you about EMEA? Given that -- I mean, obviously the results are terrific, and probably match what the hard data says today about the German economy. But then, Keith, you called out the expectations of -- I think, Europe's slowing, and clearly, the German leading indicators look down. I mean, what are your thoughts with respect to your guidance for EMEA over the course of the rest of the year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. With respect to Europe, we would expect Europe to basically be flat to slightly down as the year progresses based upon just what you commented on and that's the economic environment there. Certainly, we benefited in the exporting parts of the economy, which are still strong in Europe, and that is a plus for Rockwell Automation. So that's -- we do see the slowing. We expect it to slow as the year progresses. And that's what is baked into our guidance.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, Keith, just lastly, are you worried about price-based competition in Europe as the macro slows?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I mean, I think, we're always worried about price-based competition. That's basically -- the fundamental strategy of Rockwell Automation is value-based selling, and that may become a little more difficult. But it's the total cost of ownership that we focus on. And of that, the acquisition price is the smallest piece. So we continue to focus on differentiation, and that's driven by the innovation that we have in our technology and our differentiation in our go-to-market -- market access model. So it's always there. It's real, but we think with the innovation and the differentiation, that we can offset the natural tendency for just having a competition on price.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the geographic discussion in terms of how the regions played out versus expectations. I'm wondering if you could give us a little more color on how you felt the U.S. performed up 8% versus expectations. And any timing issues that may be related there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, the U.S. was strong, and we certainly think that at this point in the recovery, 8% year-over-year growth is very solid performance. We believe that MRO spending and medium and small project spending remain strong. There is also a continued strength of the OEM business here and their backlog continues to be strong, although limited in duration, but still continues to be operating at a reasonably high level. And we're also seeing some strength in the heavy industries, oil and gas, in particular, and a little bit, although it's a small market today, pulp and paper, has a little bit of strength in it. And transportation continues to remain strong, and we believe that will be a strong market throughout the year. And I think you're seeing that in some of the commentary, particularly around the investments, that General Motors is planning to make over the short to mid-term.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So overall, in line with your expectations on the Q1, I guess, is what I hear. And can you call out what auto was just in the U.S. on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I don't think we have a specific auto number. I would say it was probably slightly better than the same quarter of last year, and that's just based upon looking at the number of projects and the wins that we had previously. So at this point, I think auto is probably a net positive on a year-over-year basis.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So Keith, I guess, where I'm going with that -- I think our CapEx work across all the auto OEMs would suggest about a 10% year-over-year CapEx increase. If you're just slightly positive on a year-over-year basis, does that imply that you might see an acceleration in the rate of improvement in your auto business over the balance of the year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. When I say slightly positive, I mean above company average.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Above company average. That's probably in line with that 10%.","Keith D. Nosbusch","[indiscernible] about that rate that you identified. And unfortunately, the automotive is one of the examples of the definition of uneven. And that plays out mixed over the year. And each quarter is just that, a quarter, but we certainly are optimistic about the industry. And the timing is always something that is very difficult to call in the automotive sector.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Ted, on the incremental margin discussion, where are we on price cost at this point in the first quarter? And are we fully seeing the September 1 price increase, number one, sticking, and number two, reflected in the incrementals at this point?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, as we talked about -- I think, it was the last earnings call, when we implement that price, we've got a lot of customers who are under contract that renew over the course of the year. So it's kind of a progress through the year in that regard. We were anticipating, realizing about a point, maybe a little bit less than that this year price. I would say we think we're on track with that in the first quarter.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the -- within the pieces of guidance, the about 18% segment operating margin, I mean, I think to get to 18% for the full year after a 19.3% first quarter number, you've got to be sub-25% or so for the rest of the year. And you've got a very easy comp in the March quarter, as you know, because of all the issues with Japan and price cost in that quarter. So is the right way to think about where your thinking is on calibrating the guidance, you're still in that 5% to 9% range. Maybe you've come off the high end there and you're thinking segment margins about 18%. There's the sort of an implicit plus on the other side of 18% or am I missing something there?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, I think, instead of thinking about conversion margin in the balance of the year, think about total operating margin. And to get back to 18%, given the first quarter performance, would have to be in the high 17s on average, the balance of the year, or close to 18% maybe. And so we've gone through the factors that we think are going to result in lower operating margin in the balance of the year. But all of that being said, starting off with a 19.3% quarter, if anything -- maybe we're likely to do a little bit better in operating margin performance for the year, so about 18% now maybe means a little bit better than 18% instead of a little bit worse than 18%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can you just comment a little bit more on what was the favorable mix within A&S in the quarter? I mean, I get the solutions points on the Control Products & Solutions. But within A&S, it sounded like there was also favorable year-over-year mix. What was the driver of that?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, the majority of the driver of that was stronger controller sales and weaker, or I should say, lower motion sales. And that's something that really worked against us the first couple of quarters of last year. And this year, with the introduction of some of the new controllers and the expansion, some of the geographic expansion, we're driving a little higher growth. And with OEMs starting -- not starting -- at a saturation level, we're not seeing quite a strong a growth in motion as we did at the earlier point in the recovery. So it's really simply within the controller software area of the business versus more of the product -- heavy electrical product side of the segment. So...","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, thanks, that helps. And then, just in terms of you mentioned traction on PlantPAx and your positive, obviously, quarter again for process. I mean, coming out of the Automation Fair, et cetera, I mean, what have you heard from customers or what are you seeing incrementally that makes you feel good about the traction you're getting there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, a couple of things, the continued expansion of the applications that we can address with the platform. So as we talked at the fair, the evolution of PlantPAx 2.0, and that is starting to now be utilized more and more in projects and in applications. So the expansion of applications, the continued buildout of our capabilities in each region with our sales organization and our solutions organization and the capabilities that we've developed with our partners, additional system integrators that are using the products in there to meet their customer needs as well. So I would say the continued expansion of the product capabilities and functionality, the maturing of our sales organization and the execution of the sales organization and then further expansion of our partners, and then as we have talked, meeting system integrators, and then as we have talked, we continue to work with other partners such as E&H with the capabilities in instrumentation, and that combination creates the opportunity in addition to replacing legacy DCS systems which continues to be a opportunity for us, given the age of that installed base and the growing capabilities of our platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I just wanted to catch up, I guess, on what's going on in your Asia business and maybe China in particular. Because I guess there was a sense in which -- I think previously you had been saying China might see an accelerating growth rate in December versus September in terms of sales because of the backlog that you had. But it does seem as if there were some maybe pushouts, maybe some projects, recognition issues or something around working capital. I think ABB several times late last year talked about some working capital issues in markets like China. So could you perhaps just give an update on what your main sort of customer segments are doing in China? And you did say orders obviously did grow stronger than sales in the December quarter and maybe how you've see the kind of short-cycle business trend in the last couple of months there.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, as we said, and as you commented, China was a tough comparison in particular in the quarter because of the 40% growth that we had last year. And so what we're seeing there is -- let me just start with some of the macroeconomic to just characterize it a little bit. The PMI there, which is a sentiment indicator, over the last quarter and a little over a quarter has been hovering right around 50%, which means basically limited growth. And so I think what we're seeing is we're now starting to feel the reflection of that indice [ph]. And certainly, that's something that we've talked about, and obviously, what else is going on there is a little bit of a tightening of the fiscal and monetary policies that are create -- that have a negative impact on growth. And now we see the government talking about changing that around to reignite their industry. So we continue to see good strength in the automotive sector. We continue to see positive OEM business in China. And certainly, oil and gas is a growth area going forward. So I would say it's a combination of some of their activities in transportation and then a few of the more heavy industries are well. But we're also seeing a slowdown in some of the government specter, government spending areas, the infrastructure, and some of the metals and cements. So in some of those areas, less optimism, but continued strength in some of the core areas for Rockwell, which is why we believe the remainder of the year will drive growth in China and in emerging Asia.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so I guess for China, you still think you can grow your sales sort of mid-teens in fiscal '12?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think mid-teens will be difficult now. I think we're talking now probably high-single digits, low-double digits would be what our expectation is at this point given our Q1 performance and the ability to ramp up. We have very good solutions orders, but those will take a while to move through the system. So it'll be hard to get all of that into the remainder of this year. So we think high-single, low-double digit is what we have baked into our guidance for China.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just very quickly on the sort of the -- on a global basis, your kind of the products business, obviously mostly in Architecture & Software, I mean, have you seen any kind of notable gyrations in that sort of on a monthly basis in the last sort of 3 or 4 months or it's been fairly stable?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I think our products businesses have been reasonably stable and typical for the period. And what I mean by that is, obviously, there's the typical slowdowns as we exit the month of December. And we didn't see anything unusual in that regard. And I would say they're operating as we would have expected and no surprises at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Winnie Clark with UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So you talked about currency potentially being a bit of a bigger headwind for the year, around 1%. Is there any way to give us a comparable earnings impact?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes, I mean, I think, roughly, it's probably about $0.05.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then in terms of buyback. I mean, you repurchased a little bit less than you had been over the course of fiscal '11. Obviously, you had the pension contribution. Is there a way to think about potentially going back to the run rate you saw last year over the next few quarters?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I mean, coming into the year, we were expecting to get at least enough shares to offset dilution from equity-based compensation. I think, we believe we're still on that track. Q1 obviously is a slow start for us. But in part, that was because we knew we had the large pension contributions plus the payout of incentive comp and it was going to be a relatively negative cash flow quarter, and so we just went a little bit slower at the start of the year. But I would say we're still on track generally for repurchases that we were expecting coming into the year.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, lastly, on terms of cadence of CapEx spending. You talked about the potential for some CapEx delays early in the calendar year as customers go through their budgeting process. Is it fair to say that you're just not really seeing that or is there still some expectation given uncertainty that you could see some of that as we progress through the year?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, Winnie, I think when we talked about that, it was in reference to our Q2, which would be the first quarter for many -- most of our customers who are on a calendar year. And so it's a little bit early to make the call on whether we're going to see that or not.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Keith, I just wanted to dig in to the strength you saw in the EMEA. You seem to -- you said it came in large part in some export markets, which suggests some of the machine OEM sectors, and I'm trying to square the circle with weakness we've seen in Asia yet strength in the export markets. I'm just wondering, does that indicate an acceleration in Asia or are there other factors there. Again, you seem to indicate you gained some share there, so maybe if you can just comment on that as well.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think there's a lot of factors in Asia that are playing out. And I certainly don't believe the exporting power of Europe and Germany is core to the, I think, the bigger issues inside of particularly emerging Asia, which really boils down to inflation and tightening of the money supply or I should say, raising interest rates. I think they've managed to slow growth, and I think that was the strategy. And they've been successful. And now their concern is perhaps they went too far. And I think at least we're hearing the conversations of more stimulus and more government intervention, particularly in China, less so in India, but it's a similar situation. So I think it's more of those financial and economic areas that are impacting emerging Asia at this point in time. And then your other question was with respect to market share. We do believe we are growing share in the machine OEM market in Europe. And I think our growth in both our controllers and our motion platforms, as well as the continued expansion of our customer base there, is a positive sign of that, and basically, a continuation of the strategy that we started a couple of years ago. And our team in Europe is executing very well in that regard.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Ted, as we go through into 2Q, 3Q, EMEA slows down to a flat cadence covering Asia Pacific. Obviously, a lot of moving parts. Solutions has bounced around as well. But how does that shake out in terms of the 5% to 9%, 8% this quarter. Do we weaken from here and then re-accelerate? I mean, can you just provide some color on that?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, I think we have -- sequentially, we will have to see some incremental growth to each quarter in order to get to that 5% to 9% range. Obviously, it's not a lot of sequential growth at the low end of the range.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But that's normal, isn't it? You normally see sequential growth from 1Q?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I would say that's normal.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And any suggestion that you wouldn't see that at this stage?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, obviously, not because we left the guidance as it is. I mean, we have gone through at the end of January our normal process of debriefing the sales organization and kind of doing our assessment on each of the regional markets and each of the vertical markets. And right now, all that we are hearing leads us to believe that, that sales guidance is still appropriate.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just, finally, just another crack at the balance sheet question. You're virtually net debt free right now. The pension issue is behind you. Do you plan to become a bit more aggressive in terms of redeploying capital?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, I think what we do in terms of specifically share repurchase or even dividend in the balance of the year is going to be partly based on what we are doing in terms of acquisitions and what we see on operating cash flows. But I think the expectations we set in November around share repurchase for the year -- we believe that's still a very appropriate level, given what we're expecting in cash flow for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Keith, I wanted to double check the solutions' book to bill you mentioned about 1.3 in the quarter. Was that for the overall business or was that specific to Asia?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, that was specific for our solutions businesses at total for -- in global.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Total. Have you seen any pushouts of -- there were some -- you alluded a little bit to Asia. And some of these bookings on the solutions side, do they have longer deliveries? Or are you seeing any pushouts in terms of expected delivery days?","Keith D. Nosbusch","No, we have not seen pushouts anywhere in the globe at this point in time. My comment about Asia was strictly given that the orders came in, in the first quarter, they would not all be shipped within our fiscal year, and that would be a normal cycle. So nothing unusual was intended for my commentary other than a typical -- some projects are within 6 to 9 months, others are 12 to 18, and they tend to flow greater than just 1 fiscal year, particularly when you get them in that fiscal year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Sure. So would you just define your front log? When you\u2019ve talked about it in the past in terms of taking the pulse of customers and sales force, how would you define the tone of the front log at this point in time?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We would define it as customers are still talking about opportunities. They're still talking about projects. They're still looking for quotations. We have not seen a change in, I'll call it the presales activity, whether it be in our project or our product businesses. So -- and I think that goes back to Ted's comment that he made about the normal quarterly reviews that we do. There was really nothing that said danger on the horizon. We're going to go off a cliff, obviously, cautious, which is typical at the start of a new calendar year for many of our customers. And I think that's certainly something that we'll stay close to. But all of that analysis is what went into us reaffirming our guidance for the year.","Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly, Keith, when you look forward, there's been a change in the government of China's kind of tone toward subsidies especially on the auto side, kind of favoring local Chinese auto companies over multinationals or foreign companies in terms of tax subsidies and just subsidies in general. Does that have any impact on your business over the next couple of years? Are you...","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I mean, I don't know exactly how that will all be integrated into their activities. But what I can say is we've made a very conscious decision to work with the leading Chinese auto manufacturers and it\u2019s core to our automotive strategy in Europe -- in China. And we certainly expect -- and we already are doing business with the leading indigenous manufacturers. So we don't see that as a fundamental change in the way we've been operating or expect to be able to be successful with the leading Chinese car manufacturers. So...","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Quanda, we're going to take one last caller.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ted or Keith, on the solutions mix, as we think about this year, I think the guidance assumed a little bit of a headwind from solutions. Is that more significant now or about the same relative to your thoughts in November?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes, I mean, I think in November, we were expecting solutions growth to outpace product growth in the year maybe by 1 point. I think as we look at it now, we think it might be more like a couple to 3 points.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then your comment on Europe, Keith, regarding flat to down. That's the assumption for the macro, right? I know you have a fairly difficult comp in Europe year-over-year in terms of sales and you had a very good growth number here this quarter. But the flat to down, the comment, that's the macro comment, right, you expect to grow?","Keith D. Nosbusch","That's correct. That's a correct statement. We still expect to grow.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just, Ted, on accelerated depreciation in the quarter, was there any benefit that was noticeable?","Theodore D. Crandall","This is -- we're having this discussion in the last couple of quarters. There's nothing that we saw either in the order trends in the quarter or that we heard when we debrief the sales organization that would lead us to believe there was a significant impact in the quarter.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And final one is on the FX comment. So coming off a point if exchange rates stay the same, so that hurts top line growth, but doesn't it potentially support margin a little bit? Just because you have that impact this quarter whereas it turned out to be a little bit favorable. So if it hits the revenue line a little bit, does that actually be a little bit margin positive for you?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I mean, actually, I think what I was trying to make clear was I think the result we got in currency this quarter was unusually favorable. I would say typically, what I'd expect to see on the drop from sales to earnings related to currency translation is a conversion of about 15% to 20%. So to the extent that our underlying conversion is higher than that, you're right, that would help conversion margin a little bit. But the other point I want to make is that currency impact can just be very variable quarter-to-quarter.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Rohr-Dralle for closing remarks.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay.

A webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.","So with that, I'll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Thanks, Rondi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I know it's a busy earnings season for all of you, so I appreciate your time today and your interest in Rockwell Automation. The first portion of my remarks will cover the highlights for the quarter, so please turn to Page 4 in the slide deck.","Q2 was an interesting quarter with strong earnings and cash flow performance on uneven sales results by region. Adjusted EPS was up 11% on a sales decline of 2%. While there was some benefit from a lower tax rate in the quarter, most of the EPS increase was from operating performance. Sales in the quarter came in below our expectations, primarily due to our large decline in Asia.","So let me go into Asia in a bit more depth. Sales in Asia were down 18% and the weakness in the region was broad-based. China and India were both down 16% in the quarter. Australia and Southeast Asia saw even larger percentage declines. We believe this is attributable to weak market conditions, as evidenced by continued project delays.","I told you last quarter that I felt sentiment had improved in China, and I still believe that's true. We did see some sequential sales growth in China in Q2, but the improvement was well below our expectations. There are signs that point to a better second half in China, but we're somewhat cautious because current investment levels seem at odds with some of the published macro data. All of that said, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for China. The evolution to a more consumption-based economy will drive investment in consumer packaged goods manufacturing, which is a sweet spot for us.","Before I end my discussions on the top line, let me share a couple of other data points that I know you're always interested in. Process sales declined less than 1 point this quarter. We think Process will be flat to slightly up this year. Logix was flat in the quarter, so a bit better than the Architecture & Software segment as a whole. And the solution and services book-to-bill was again solid at 1.14. Operating margin of 18.7% in the quarter was very good given the sales decline with a strong contribution from productivity.","Before I move on to the outlook, let me share a couple of thoughts on the first half of the year. Given market conditions, I'm pleased with where we are at the halfway point. On flat sales, we've been able to maintain margins while continuing to make select longer-term investments. Productivity was very good in the first half with contributions from all function, businesses and regions across the organization. Productivity is core to our growth and performance strategy.","Cash flow in the first half was strong, and we recently raised dividend another 11%. We've increased our dividend by almost 80% over the last 4 years, reinforcing our commitment to returning excess cash to shareowners. And we continue to generate very high return on invested capital.","So now we are onto the outlook. This is how we're thinking about the second half of the fiscal year. Industrial markets remain uneven around the world. The U.S. and Latin America are on steady growth paths, but the recession in Europe continues and Asia has been stubbornly weak. We continue to believe that the second half will be better than the first half, with sequential sales growth in all regions and across our products and solutions and services businesses.","Sequential growth will be highest for our solutions businesses, which typically have a very strong Q4. And we're entering the second half with a solid project backlog. But the year-over-year growth rates in the second half will be uneven across the region.","With 2 quarters behind us and given our current assessment of global economic and market conditions, we're lowering our sales outlook for the year to 0% to 3% organic growth. However, we're maintaining the midpoint of adjusted EPS guidance and narrowing the range from $5.40 to $5.70. Ted will go into more detail on this guidance.","I have a few closing remarks before handing it off to Ted to go through the rest of the slides. For the fifth time, the Ethisphere Institute has named us one of the world's most ethical companies, a recognition honoring companies that outperform industry peers when it comes to business ethics, governance, anticorruption and sustainability. I want to thank our employees for continuing to make integrity a core company value and incorporating it into the business decisions they make every day.","Together with our partners, we have proven we can effectively execute in all market conditions. We manage costs prudently with a sharp focus on select investments when things are slow and we're continuously finding more ways to add value to our customers. Even in this low-growth environment, I am confident we will continue to improve our market position, build our pipeline of opportunities, drive productivity and deliver superior returns to our shareowners.","Here's Ted to provide more details on the financial results for the quarter and our revised outlook for 2013. Ted?","Theodore D. Crandall","Thanks, Keith, and good morning, everybody. My comments will continue to reference the charts that Rondi and Keith mentioned. And I'll start with Page 5, Second Quarter Results Summary.","Revenue in the quarter was $1,523,000,000. That's down 2% compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year impact of currency and acquisitions was negligible, so sales were down 2% organically as well. Segment operating earnings in the quarter, current period, were $285 million, up 3% compared to Q2 last year. General corporate net was $18.1 million in Q2 compared to $24.5 million in Q2 last year. Last year in Q2, general corporate net included a $7 million legacy environmental charge.","The adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 23.6%. That compares to an adjusted effective rate in the same period last year of 25.3%. We benefited in the quarter from a catch-up adjustment related to the extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit. The impact of the catch up, both for fiscal '12 and for the first quarter of this year, reduced the effective rate in Q2 by about 3 points.","Adjusted earnings per share were $1.33. That compares to $1.20 in the same quarter last year, so up 11%. The lower tax rate contributed about $0.03 to the year-over-year improvement. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter was 141.8 million. We repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares in the second quarter at a cost of about $126 million. And at the end of Q2, there were $723 million remaining under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Through the first half of the fiscal year, we repurchased 2.6 million shares for approximately $214 million, so slightly ahead of the rate required to hit the $400 million full year repurchase expectation that we talked about in the previous earnings calls this year.","Moving to Page 6. This is the graphical version of total company results for the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, you can see the 2% year-over-year sale decline. Sales increased by 2% sequentially. On the right side of the chart, you can see a modest increase in segment operating earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially.","Total segment operating margin in Q2 was 18.7%, up a full point from second quarter last year despite the lower sales and also up 0.2 point sequentially. In the year-over-year comparison, the impact of lower sales was more than offset by strong productivity, some favorable mix and lower variable compensation expense.","The productivity includes a number of factors. We have savings from the restructuring actions taken in Q4 last year, and we have not fully redeployed those savings because of the continued sluggish market conditions. We also experienced a strong contribution from cost reduction and process improvement activities in the quarter. And generally, we've maintained pretty tight controls on discretionary spending. The entire organization is focused on productivity and cost control given the slowdown in growth, and Q2 saw a particularly strong result in that regard. While not on the chart, our trailing fourth quarter return on invested capital was 29.8% at the end of the second quarter.","Now please turn to Page 7, which summarizes the Q2 results of the Architecture & Software segment. Looking at the left side of this chart, sales were down 4% year-over-year, down 3% organically. Sales were also down 3% sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, the largest portion of the pie was due to Asia Pacific results. Operating margin for the quarter was 26.6%. That's up 0.9 points compared to Q2 last year. The margin increase is attributable to many of the same factors I talked about for the company as a whole. But additionally, Q2 last year was a relatively low-margin quarter for Architecture & Software, so also a somewhat easy comparison.","The next page, Page 8, covers our Control Products & Solutions segment. Compared to Q2 last year, sales were down 1%, both as reported and organically. Sales for the product businesses in this segment were up 1% year-over-year and the solutions and services businesses were down 2%. Sales for the segment increased 6% sequentially, primarily driven by a 9% sequential increase in the solutions and services businesses. On the right side of this chart, you'll note the year-over-year and sequential earnings improvement. Operating margin in this segment increased by 1.2 points year-over-year to 13%.","Similar theme in this segment, with the effect of lower volume more than offsetting those same 3 factors -- being more than offset by those same 3 factors of productivity, favorable mix and lower variable compensation expense.","Switching to the next page. This is the geographic breakdown of our sales in the quarter. I'll focus my comments on the far right column, which displays organic growth. Basically, growth in the Americas and decline in the other regions. As Keith noted, the U.S. and Canada have continued to perform well in a relative sense. The U.S. was up 2% in the quarter. Canada was up 1%. And that's against a pretty difficult year-ago comparison. Canada grew 25% in Q2 last year and 20% for the full year.","Latin America was our highest growth region in Q2, up 6%, with particularly strong growth in Mexico this quarter. EMEA was down 5%. Generally results in the southern countries continue to be below the region average and emerging market results continue to be above. And as Keith noted, Asia-Pacific was down 18% year-over-year with weak results across the region.","Keith provided a good deal of color, particularly on China, so I won't repeat all of that.","Instead, I'll turn to Page 10, which is free cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $180 million, another strong quarter. Year-to-date conversion on adjusted income is about 93%. That's a very good result from the first half of the year, and we continue to expect conversion of about 100% for the full year.","And that takes us to the final slide, Page 11, which addresses our current outlook for fiscal '13. As Keith mentioned, we're updating the guidance. We now expect sales to be in the range of $6.25 billion to $6.45 billion. That revenue range represents organic growth for the full year of between 0% and 3%. That's down from the previous guidance of 1% to 5%.","With lowered sales expectations for the full year partly due to our year-to-date performance, we still expect to see some improvement in the second half, primarily in our solutions and services businesses. However, we expect a lower year-over-year growth rate in the second half now compared to the previous guidance. We believe that currency and acquisitions will add less than 0.5 point of growth for the full year. That's down from about 1 point in our prior guidance and mainly due to a stronger dollar.","We expect segment margin for the full year to be about 18.9% compared to 18.7% in our previous guidance. In part, that's a reflection of our year-to-date margin results. We expect adjusted EPS in the range of $5.40 to $5.70, so we've narrowed the range but maintained the same midpoint. We now foresee a full year adjusted tax rate of about 25%.  The previous guidance was 25% to 26%. We still expect to spend about $400 million on share repurchases this year. And finally, we still expect general corporate net expense to be about $83 million for the full year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Rondi, and we can begin the Q&A.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Great. Thanks, Ted. Before get started, I'd just like to say that as our analyst coverage has expanded, it's been a challenge for us to get to all the callers in the queue, and we do our best. But I guess, I would ask for your cooperation in that as well. [Operator Instructions] So we appreciate your cooperation. And Emily, let's take our first questioner.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Keith, thanks for the comments around China. Could we dig into that a little bit more? China this quarter seems to be a little all over the map in terms of companies and their results. Some are up a lot and some like you struggled. You thought it was going to grow about 5%. Obviously, I'm assuming that's not on the table anymore. Keith, what are you seeing there? Is it broad? Is it because of just credit restrictions? Is it -- just what's kind of the tone of what your customer's saying?","Keith D. Nosbusch","To your first comment, John, you're absolutely right, we don't see a 5% growth for the full year at this point in time. In fact, it will probably be slightly negative for the full year. We do think that it will improve as we go through the second half. We're pleased with some of the solutions backlog that we've been able to build. But really I think there's a dimension of liquidity there, particularly for the small and mid-sized companies. I think it's probably a slower-developing recovery at this point than we had anticipated. A part of that may be because their stimulus was probably only 1\/4 of what it was a number of years ago when we saw a much more rapid recovery. And I would say I think China is -- what we're also sensing from some of the latest data that we've had is that China is probably being impacted more now from the overall economy in the other regions, in particularly Europe and other countries in Asia. The exports have dropped dramatically in the last report that we've seen. And that is a big part of their economy. I mean, we talked about in the future that we believe it will be consumption-oriented. But today, it's infrastructure and it's exports. And exports have been down. Infrastructure has had minimal stimulus, as I mentioned, compared to the previous one. So right now, I think we see China as struggling to generate the types of growth that we've seen previously.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. No, that makes sense. So just as then the follow-up, Keith, how did your quarter progress? It looks like the month of March was a bad month in general for Europe. And generally speaking, the end of March sort of wasn't that great, depending on the region and your exposure. What's the tone of your business? And any kind of comments you could make on April would be helpful.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Sure. Well, basically, the quarter proceeded like a normal Q2 for us. And it starts out slow and March is one of our stronger months generally. And we saw that uptick continue in March, so progressed slightly better as the quarter progressed. And April, with what we're seeing to date, April started slow. That isn't unusual given the fact that we had the holiday right at the start. But it's consistent performance month-to-date with our revised guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis for Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to back up and just ask kind of a bigger question -- bigger-picture question. It seems that automation, on an overall basis, if we look at your competitors as well, has really slowed globally probably a little bit below global GDP. I mean, is it -- do you think in your opinion is this more related to just the fact that people are so uncertain about the growth outlook that they're willing to put off investments, particularly productivity investments? And do you think that's a timing issue and we get a snapback? Or do you think this is something that could linger a while?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, at this point, with the information we have and the conversations with customers and our sales organization and channel partners, we believe it's the continued uncertainty and the, I'll just call it, the constant swing of news with respect to whether it's in Europe and the continuing lingering of financial austerity versus growth investments, and then some of the conversation of overcapacity in China. I think the uncertainty factor continues to be, at this point anyway, the bigger card that is keeping investments from occurring at this point in time. And I say that for those reasons, but also it's not like companies' balance sheets are not in good condition. So it's not a lack of ability to invest. I think the greater impediment today is the uncertainty. And I think that is what's been lingering more than normal.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, makes sense. And just to follow up on John's question on China. I mean, is it your sense that you've lost share at all in China in the couple of quarters? I'm not sure that your competitors have seen quite the pullback that you guys have? Or is it just the question really of the mix business that you have there?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I think you answered it a little. First, if you go back to last year, we definitely know we were outperforming many of the competitors on a relative basis. And I think today, we certainly do not believe we're losing share. There is not really any good real-time market data there, so I want to be careful with my comment. But we do know that our loss weight rate is not increasing. So we're winning what we were previously. There's just fewer projects. And so we don't -- once again, anecdotally, we don't believe we're losing share. And we do think the mix has the largest percentage of why we're, at this point, appear to be somewhat disadvantaged compared to the competition. But we aren't losing at a greater rate. We just think there's fewer projects and that those projects are less prevalent than they had previously been. And quite frankly, we are no less bullish on the market for the longer term, particularly given our portfolio and our capabilities, than we were previously. So I think we're just at a point in the cycle in China where we might be slightly more disadvantaged. But the longer outlook, we think, still bodes well for our opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa for JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just on the margin, pretty surprising there that you guys are able to -- I guess, last cycle, if you'd put up a negative comp like this, we probably would've seen a little bit more margin pressure. Maybe if you could just talk through and give a little more detail around what's driving that. I also think you had a sequential step-up in incentive comp. Maybe that didn't happen, I don't know. So even in the context of that, it looks even better. So just curious if there's more detail around your margin performance.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So well,  if you look at the year-over-year comparison, I talked a little bit about that in my comments. Basically, we had a negative impact from volume obviously, but we more than offset that with primarily strong productivity results. And the productivity results was a combination of the restructuring savings that we haven't redeployed. And basically we haven't redeployed them because we're continuing to see pretty sluggish market conditions. We've been very tight on discretionary spending and the organization has reacted well with that. And then probably, most importantly, in our cost reduction and process improvement initiatives, we just had a very good result year-to-date. But particularly this quarter, and coupled with a little bit of favorable mix and coupled with the fact that our incentive compensation expense is down year-over-year, that allowed us to more than offset the volume impact. Sequentially, we did have a merit increase, not an incentive comp increase but a merit increase, Steve. And we were able to offset that basically with those same factors that I talked about.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, what are you doing -- this is a follow-up. What are you doing -- what are you not doing this cycle that you would've been doing last cycle with the more optimistic -- I guess, I'm just curious, not only from your perspective but also other companies are obviously behaving very differently in this environment. What are the things that you are not spending on that you would've been spending on last cycle?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I don't know if we're behaving that differently. I mean, we're talking about a slight decline here compared to a pretty dramatic and pretty quick one in that last cycle. So what we're doing, to Ted's point, is we're holding discretionary and any of the redeployment of our savings from what we did in Q4. The restructuring savings, we're just very slow at allowing that to be reinvested. And so we picked a couple of very key areas. But other than that, it's the productivity that Ted talked about. And I think the other point that probably we should make is this is something that does has variability quarter-to-quarter. So we certainly don't think we'll see the same strength of productivity as the year continues to progress. But this was a very strong quarter and across a lot of the organization.","Theodore D. Crandall","I mean, in that regard, we talked a little bit about this on the earnings call last quarter. We had a somewhat difficult comparison in Q1 and somewhat easier comparison in Q2. If you look at our year-to-date margin performance, we're basically flat on a little bit of a sales decline, so probably closer to what you would've expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baliotti with Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Keith, could you kind of go around the world in your geographies and characterize the type of demand you're seeing? If you look at -- maybe put in the buckets of MRO versus project. Just kind of give us a sense of where customers -- where their heads are at right now.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. Well, I think at this point, let's start with probably the one that's a little easier, and that's the U.S. What we're seeing in the U.S. is definitely MRO and project, small project investing. And that's probably typical at this point. The U.S., the manufacturing is running, I'll say, reasonably strong compared to the rest of the world. And so you would expect to have MRO and small project activity. And in fact, in the U.S., that is what we believe is driving the growth rates that Ted talked about. If we go to Europe, in Europe, we believe it's a number of activities. We still believe we're doing well in some of the northern countries.","As Ted said, we have the North-South phenomena here. And certainly, we see good work in some of the machine builder areas in those northern countries, particularly Germany. And a lot of that is export, which is a strength of Rockwell Automation. We don't have a meaningful installed base throughout Western Europe, so the MRO business there is probably not being -- is not helping. But on the other hand, it's not hurting because certainly the capacity utilization in Europe is down. The strength in Europe for us is, in this quarter anyways, is mainly in emerging, where it is positive growth in total, driven a lot by the Middle East, which is heavy project-oriented. And that project-oriented would be oil and gas, as well as metals and mining to some degree, but we see that. And so it would be more project work there for sure than the MRO. And there's really not much of an OEM base in the emerging EMEA. If we go to Latin America, there it's a mixture. We mentioned that Mexico was very strong. That continues to be a strong performer for us. There we see auto being a help. And we also see the strength of mining and food and beverage in Mexico as well. So it's more project work than any place else. Brazil, Brazil remains positive for us. There the majority of the work has been in project work. I would say it's been weaker in the OEMs. They're still struggling with some of their competitiveness in the global market and -- but yet we see the oil and gas activities and improvement in the CPG industries there for us. In Asia, Asia, we don't really have a strong MRO content if you look outside of Australia and New Zealand. So really there it's driven by the lack of exports, the problems with liquidity, and therefore, the ability to invest in small, mid-sized projects. And the larger projects are dealing with some of the overcapacity if you look at what's going on in metals in China and other region -- other countries in the region. So that's a little flavor as we go around the geographies. And I guess, I'll stop there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Keith, in relation to that, can you walk through globally what you're seeing in automotive in their investment cycle right now, were investments still being made, were they're falling off? Does it seem to be kind of a peak here globally for at least the CapEx investments for automotive?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. We think, to your point, we think automotive is continuing to invest at a high level, but it's not growing, but it's still a meaningful level of investment. And I would say the easiest one to talk about is Europe, in particular Western Europe. Very, very little investment there. Most of it is still rationalization of plants, which they have not gone through. And you've heard recent announcements there by almost all of the major companies about trying to take capacity out. And I think that will continue to be the situation in Europe for the foreseeable future. If we come back to the U.S., there we have a lot of continued investment, both from the U.S. manufacturers as well as the multinationals and the foreign companies that are continuing to invest. That has been positive. We see a number of projects continuing. And we believe '13 and '14, will stay at a reasonable level as we see the outlook for the U.S. In Latin America, Latin America, I mentioned the strength of Mexico. Some of that is definitely ongoing automotive investments. And I think really the only other country where there's any meaningful automotive capacity is Brazil. And there is investment going on there, although some projects are starting to -- have been delayed, not for economic decisions but for just the ability to create the infrastructure that's needed given where one of the major plants is being located. If we go to Asia, China, I would say we don't see significant growth in the investments in automotive in China. However, there continues to be investment in both the joint ventures, which obviously you need to have in China if you're a non-Chinese producer. And then also the top Chinese companies, the top indigenous Chinese companies are also continuing to invest. And when I talk about them, it's probably the top 5 to 10. As you know, there's hundreds of automotive companies in China, and that is not going to stay in that condition as time moves on. We're going to see a massive consolidation. But the larger ones are continuing to invest. India, very weak. We don't see much investment going on there at this point in time. Korea and Japan, in the indigenous markets, we don't play very strongly in the automotive. But we work very, very well with the Japanese and Korean companies when they build outside of their home country. So that would reflect more of my comments about the U.S. investment, Mexico investment and Latin America investment. So that's a little flavor for what we see going on in the automotives, continued high levels of investment, but we don't see incremental growth at the levels that we're currently at.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Great. That's a lot of flavor. And then just quickly looking at CP&S, is there a disconnect? But how are motor control and products in this segment relative to the services and solutions?","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes. So in the quarter, year-over-year, the product portion of the segment was up 1% and solutions and services was down 2%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Kwas for Wells Fargo.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Keith, could you comment on the mining and metals market? I know it's been mixed for you over the last several quarters by region and just wanted to get an update there. And then if we're in a prolonged cycle where investment is going to continue to decline, how are you thinking -- what's your thoughts on that and how you're prepping the business for that potential outcome?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. Well, with mining, as we look at that, it continues to be mixed results. We certainly see the drops in declining commodity prices, which is starting to limit some of the investments. And I guess, the good news in mining, where those investments are being limited, many of the mining companies are now focused on productivity in their existing operations as opposed to new investments. And that still results -- still will result in some business for us. In the U.S., we had a good quarter in mining. We see mining as still -- and when I talk about mining, I'm not talking about coal mining. That's probably the area in the U.S. that is weaker. But we don't play -- we don't have a strong position in the underground mining in coal in the U.S. So we aren't hurt by that situation. In Canada, we see it weakening and mainly driven by the global commodity of prices. EMEA, really the mining in EMEA is South Africa. That continues to be weak because of the labor unrest. And as we mentioned in the commentary that I and Ted made in Asia, the weakness was broad-based, but we specifically mentioned Australia. And Australia is heavily driven by the mining industry and China and India are the real destination of a lot of their exports. And with both of those countries weaker, it is impacting mining in China. In Latin America, it's mixed. I think some of the new investments are slowing in Latin America, particularly in the Andean region, and in Brazil. And we see a pickup in mining in Mexico. So it continues to be mixed. I think you also talked about metals. Metals, we see continued slowing in spending and investments. We certainly believe that there's overcapacity in China. And I did mention, however, part of the Middle East growth was because of mining with the -- because of metals, particularly energy-intensive investments are still being made in the Middle East, particularly in aluminum. And we're benefiting from some of that investment. So that would be the commentary around those 2. And I guess, I spoke so long, you had a second question.","Theodore D. Crandall","I think it was a potential slowdown.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Yes. Okay. Ted just reminded me. Well, I mean, as we went into the year, we had our contingency plans set. Ted mentioned that we've been very tight on discretionary spending. We think at these levels that, that is the prudent thing to do. And we don't see this as a prolonged slowdown. We would still call this as part of the mid-cycle pause. So what we're doing today and how we're approaching it with watching our reinvestment rates and watching discretionary spending, we believe those are the appropriate actions at this point. And we always continue to monitor what's going on in the external markets, how it's impacting us and be in a position where we can respond if things change one way or the other. But quite frankly, we have a lot of good projects to invest in if we start seeing some growth. And we're hoping that later in the year, we can start making some of those investments as it becomes a little more uncertain-ish for what the growth is going to be going forward.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up, these restructuring benefits that you had this quarter, I mean, that should continue for the rest of the fiscal year, correct? Is that the right way to think about it?","Theodore D. Crandall","Well, I think it will continue until we see a pickup in sales that causes us to start to redeploy some of that investment, as Keith was just discussing.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's going to be at your discretion, obviously.","Theodore D. Crandall","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan for RBC.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","You talked a lot about the end markets, some good color there. Just wondering maybe in terms of the end markets, what's a little bit weaker than you had expected? And what sort of changed in your outlook and assumptions?","Keith D. Nosbusch","From end markets, I think we have to look at it by region because in reality, most of the regions are performing as we expected, other than Asia. And so if we talk about end markets in Asia, I would say a little bit to the conversation that we had earlier. Mining is very weak. Metals is very weak. And I would say infrastructure investments in China have been slower as far as ramping up than we thought. Cement in China would be weaker. And I think some of the OEMs in China are weaker. And I would say that because of the commentary I gave on the export numbers. And I think it's hurting some of the smaller, less sophisticated machines that China is a leading exporter of. So I think we're seeing an impact in the OEM. And then finally, as far as the OEM sectors themselves, I think tire has probably been one of the weaker sectors in the region. And whether that's from an end-user consumption or the machine builders, I think we've seen tire probably slow a little quicker than we originally had thought. So a lot of it driven by the materials or the mining activities in Asia, some machinery builders and OEM content, and then some of the heavy industries, the metals, the cement, some of the power generation, and then infrastructure. So I would say that's -- those are where the differences are. And a lot of that comes back to Asia, and then China and the other emerging markets.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then I guess, just in the second half, it looks like the organic growth in the range of somewhere in the flat to up 5% or 6%. Is Asia the big swing factor there? Or is that a big chunk of it, and then, say, the upper end assumed some pickup in the broader economies and other regions as well?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, if we look at -- from an organic standpoint, we believe the greatest growth in the second half will -- and we think at our midpoint, the second half organic growth is about 3% year-over-year. So the greatest growth there is really in Latin America, where we expect it to be mid-single-digits; the U.S., low single-digits; and EMEA, low to mid-single-digits as well, from an organic growth standpoint. And as I mentioned earlier, we still expect Asia-Pacific to be weak and both China and the region will be negative low single-digits for the second half. So that's a little characterization of where we think it's coming from. But overall, 3% organic growth once again at the midpoint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker for Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Logix was up about 5%, I guess, last quarter. And this quarter, you said it's up again. Maybe give us a little bit of perspective for how much you're seeing in existing versus new customers for Logix and where the gain is happening and whether you think you're winning, who you're winning the -- what sort of share perspective is on that given that's one of the bright spots still.","Keith D. Nosbusch","Okay. Well, let me make sure I characterize the Logix comment. I thought I had said that Logix was flat but higher than the A&S average. So I just want to make sure that, that's clear, that Logix was flat but higher than the A&S growth, which was negative. And certainly, we believe that we're still going to see growth in Logix. The outlook is for that to be in the mid-single-digit growth as we go through the remainder of the year and to continue to be above the A&S average for the second half. The success we're having with Logix continues to be driven in 2 areas. The first one is the continued expansion into Process. Now Process hasn't been growing strong, as you know, in the last 2 quarters. But we're still engaged in activity and projects, and Process will be an expansion area for Logix as those markets begin to recover. And part of our backlog that we have in our solutions business is obviously in Process. And that will continue to generate an expansion of an installed base of Logix going forward. The other area that Logix is being successful in, as we have talked about, is the continued expansion of the midrange family and how that expands our capabilities to address more of the OEM business globally. And that's part of the reasons we are continuing to have success in certain countries in Europe, in particular the exporting OEM market. And we continue to generate conversion opportunities with those new platforms with OEMs in Europe, the U.S. as well as the exporting Asian countries. Now obviously, the decline we had in China meant that OEMs were also down. But we're continuing to work with them to incorporate the new midrange platform of products, whether it be motion, drives or PLCs, logic controllers, that enable us to grow that business as time goes on. So Process and OEMs, key areas, and then safety would be the third area. We still have a very differentiated integrated safety capability, and that plays very well in both machine, safety and discrete manufacturing, where you want to have an integrated control and safety solution.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then on the U.S. dynamic, maybe talk a little bit, are you seeing anything to the idea and concept of nearshoring at this point or any -- I mean, what's your outlook from that perspective for North America? A lot of hype obviously, in this area. Anything that would give you any indication that there's something to it in select spaces?","Keith D. Nosbusch","I don't think we would say that we've seen anything to it at this point in time yet. But certainly, the conversations have great potential, really driven at -- the core of the whole conversation is around a couple things. One, the increasing cost in some of the low-cost manufacturing environments around the world. In particular, all of you have seen the continued inflation in China, the wage increases and the conversation of the need for more automation. On one hand, that's very good for us because we'll supply all of that automation. On the other hand, U.S. companies can be competitive now, and so the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing is what's very important. And certainly, what we do for our customers helps them to improve their competitiveness. And I think as that differential get smaller, the competitiveness in the U.S. comes to the forefront if we continue to invest. The other dimension, which is probably the longer-term play but one that maybe has the greatest potential, is the whole conversation around energy and in particular, gas. And if the U.S. takes advantage of its gas reserves and the fact that we could have the lowest-cost energy in the world, which once again is a huge competitive advantage, you could see a very meaningful uptick in the downstream industries associated with gas. And today, you see production and exploration going on. But the downstream would be the chemical industries, fine chemicals, plastics and also energy-intensive industries, some of the metals industries. If the U.S. has the lowest-cost energy, which we do, and we create the right infrastructure, which means pipelines and transmission lines, we can regenerate that entire industry, in particular along the Gulf Coast and the South. And I think that is the longer-term opportunity for U.S. And hopefully, that is something that the government finds a way to encourage, incent and support for the long-term growth of jobs of quite candidly a very prosperous middle class and a very, very robust industrial sector for many years to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Keith, the U.S. still remains pretty solid but kind of uneven, as you talked about. So it was up 2% a couple quarters ago, then up 6%, now up 2% again. I mean, do you have any thoughts on what's driving the unevenness in the U.S. and why the first quarter was particularly strong and a little bit pulled back this quarter? What are you seeing in terms of, I guess, how your customers are managing their buying behavior?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, I mean, I would tend to fall back on our comments that we normally make, and that is quarter-to-quarter variability and project variability, end-of-the-year timing as there are some budget activity that's going on that creates it, the tax incentives, a lot of nuanced areas as opposed to -- and I think it's methodically moving forward. The perturbations that we see tend to be things that we have a very hard time quantifying or particularly identifying at any -- as any specific. This is what happened in our first quarter. This is what didn't happen in our second quarter. So I think it's the quarter-to-quarter variability. And really project timing is probably the biggest mover as far as that goes. But I mean, it's very difficult for us to identify the short-term movements in our business.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then just as you think through this back half, is there anything by vertical market in terms of comps that get easier or particular backlog you have in place that you kind of have a view into better growth in the second half year-over-year?","Keith D. Nosbusch","Well, certainly, what drives -- the biggest driver of our belief in improvement in the second half is the backlog of our solutions businesses. And we talked about the book-to-bill, the last 2 quarters, it was over 1 meaningfully in our first quarter. I think I said 1.14 this quarter. We feel confident that, that is shippable backlog and we expect that to go out over the next 2 quarters. And that's one of the, I would say, more firm picture that we have as to why we believe the second half will see both year-over-year growth and stronger sequential growth.","Theodore D. Crandall","And particularly sequentially, the solutions backlog at the end of the first half, it's driving that sequential growth in the second half.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So you have pretty good visibility into that at this point?","Keith D. Nosbusch","We do for 2 quarters. And that's why we -- that's why Ted made the comment. It's pretty solid and obviously, the only 2 I got you there are: one, our ability to execute, which I have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to do; and then secondly, is there project delays from our customers. And those are the things we don't know. We don't see anything unusual in that regard now. But what happens over the next 2 quarters, that would be the other factor that could cause even a solid backlog to not occur from a revenue standpoint.","Rondi Rohr-Dralle","Okay. Emily and all of the callers, thank you so much for dialing in today and thanks for your discipline on 1 question and a follow-up. I'm obviously available for follow-up calls with analysts after this. So thanks, everyone, for joining us.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Patrick Goris, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Goris, please go ahead.","Patrick Goris","Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation\u2019s first quarter fiscal \u201916 earnings release conference call. With me today are Keith Nosbusch, our Chairman and CEO, and Ted Crandall, our CFO. Our agenda includes opening remarks by Keith on the company\u2019s performance in the first quarter. Keith will also provide context around our outlook for fiscal \u201916. Then Ted will provide more details on the results, as well as our sales and adjusted earnings per share guidance. As always, we\u2019ll take questions at the end of Ted\u2019s remarks. We expect the call to take about an hour today.","Our results were released this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website at www.rockwellautomation.com. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, and the webcast of this call is accessible at that website and will be available for replay for the next 30 days. ","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our forecasted projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings. ","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Keith.","Keith Nosbusch","Thanks Patrick, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I\u2019ll start with some key points for the quarter, so please turn to Page 3 in the slide deck.","As expected, we had a weak start to the fiscal year with organic sales down a little over 3%. During the quarter, heavy industry end markets continued to soften globally, particularly oil and gas. Consumer and auto verticals were about flat. In the U.S., the weakness that started at the end of fiscal 2015 persisted throughout the first quarter and was broad-based across verticals. ","Oil and gas again was the weakest vertical in the U.S. with sales down over 30% compared to last year, worse than we expected. In China, solid growth in the consumer and auto verticals was more than offset by the very weak heavy industry and tire verticals. Sales in China declined about 10% in the quarter. I am pleased with our continued solid growth in EMEA and Latin America. Emerging EMEA and Mexico continued to be bright spots. Total emerging markets were up 3% in the quarter despite the decline in China. Further weakening of heavy industry end markets globally impacted our process business, which was down 14% in the quarter. ","Process growth in EMEA and Latin America was more than offset by declines in the U.S. and Asia. Logic sales were impacted by the significant decline in process industries, including oil and gas, and declined 6% in the quarter. You may recall that logic\u2019s growth was 7% in the same quarter one year ago, so certainly a tough comp. I am pleased that we were able to hold segment margin near 21% despite 9% lower sales. Ted will elaborate more on Q1 financial performance in his remarks.","Let\u2019s move on to what we expect for the balance of fiscal 2016. With respect to the macroeconomic indicators, the most recent industrial production forecasts call for lower economic growth in 2016 than previously estimated, and only modest sequential improvement later in the fiscal year. Also, since we provided guidance in November oil and commodity prices have further deteriorated. As a result, we expect our global heavy industry end markets, particularly oil and gas, to be weaker than assumed in our November guidance. For the U.S., our largest market, industrial projection growth projections have now turned negative for our fiscal year, and a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar continues to affect U.S.-based producers and equipment builders across verticals.","In China, we expect continued weakness in the heavy industry and tire verticals that remain plagued with over-capacity and a lack of capital investments. The consumer, life sciences and auto verticals are still not large enough to offset those declines, but they continue to grow, which bodes well for the future. In EMEA, we see continued growth led by emerging countries. Western Europe is stable and continues to improve slowly. Home and personal care is expected to be the strongest vertical in this region, oil and gas the weakest. ","Finally, we believe Latin America again will be our strongest region this fiscal year, led by Mexico. Mexico continues to do exceptionally well across a broad range of industries, including oil and gas. We expect strength in Mexico will offset weakness elsewhere in the region. ","Taking all these factors into consideration, we now expect fiscal 2016 organic sales to be down 1% to 5% and no longer expect year-over-year growth later in the fiscal year. Including the effects of a larger headwind from currency, we are updating fiscal 2016 sales guidance to about $5.9 billion and EPS guidance to $5.70 to $6.20. Ted will provide more detail around sales and earnings guidance in his remarks.","Before I turn it over to Ted, I would like to again thank the many of you who attended Automation Fair in November. We had record attendance and I\u2019m sure you were able to notice firsthand the excitement generated by our technology innovations, our expanding product portfolio, including our next generation high performance architecture, and our broader and deeper domain expertise. The connected enterprise message and deliverables are resonating with our customers globally, and our progress has not gone unnoticed. Control Magazine, a leading process industry publication, just released its annual Reader\u2019s Choice Awards and once again our results were great. Of the 53 opportunities across 10 industries and six control disciplines, Rockwell Automation received 32 first place awards. The next best recipient had only 12. ","We continue to be recognized as the only automation company with a scalable, multi-disciplined, integrated control and information architecture for plant-wide optimization. This was our best performance yet in this annual survey of process automation professionals, and it is a good indicator of how far we have come with our modern DCS portfolio of technology and domain expertise. Innovation truly is the lifeblood of our sustainable, competitive differentiation. ","While current market conditions certainly are challenging, we will appropriately balance short-term financial performance with our long-term opportunities. We will protect key investments in innovation, domain expertise and commercial resources, and we will continue to expand our served market and gain share. ","I am very optimistic on our long-term growth prospects and would like to thank our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued dedication in serving our customers.","With that, let me turn it over to Ted.","Ted Crandall","Okay, thanks Keith. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start on Page 4 with our first quarter key financial information. Sales in the quarter were $1.427 million, and that was 9.4% lower than Q1 last year. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.3% and currency translation reduced sales in the quarter by 6.1%. Segment operating margin was 20.7%, and that was down 130 basis points from Q1 last year and primarily due to the lower sales volume and the negative impact from currency. General corporate net was $18 million in Q1 compared to $23 million a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.49, down $0.15 or 9% compared to the first quarter of last year. ","The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 22.8% compared to 26% in Q1 last year. Congress recently enacted a retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit for 2015 and made the credit permanent going forward. Without that extension, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 would have been pretty close to our previous full-year tax rate guidance of 27%. ","Free cash flow for Q1 was $145 million. Free cash flow conversion on adjusted income was 74%, and we would think of that as a pretty typical result for Q1. Our trailing four-quarter return on invested capital was 32.6%, and there are a couple of items not shown here. Average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were 132.6 million, down about 3% compared to last year, and during the first quarter we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $122 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $323 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","The next two slides present the sales and operating margin performance of each segment. Page 5 is the architecture and software segment. Beginning on the left side of the chart, architecture and software segment sales were $643 million in Q1, down 9.2% compared to Q1 last year. The organic sales decline was 2.7%, and currency translation reduced sales by 6.5%. ","Moving to the right side of the chart, on the lower sales volume, A&S margins were 27.4%, down 3.9 points from Q1 last year. Lower sales volume had a significant impact. This segment also bears the larger brunt of the negative currency conversion impact. I would note that Q1 last year was the highest quarterly margin for architecture and software. Sequentially compared to Q4, margin in this segment was about flat. ","Moving to Page 6, the control products and solutions segment, in the first quarter control products and solution sales were $784 million, down 9.6% year-over-year and down 3.8% on an organic basis. Currency translation reduced sales by 5.8%. For the CP&S product businesses, the organic sales decline was about 1%. Solutions and services sales were down about 6% organically. The book-to-bill in Q1 for solutions and services was 1.13. CP&S continued to deliver very good operating margin at 15.3% in Q1, up 80 basis points year-over-year despite the decline in sales, another good productivity quarter.","Page 7 provides a geographic breakdown of our sales and shows the year-over-year organic growth results for the quarter. The overall organic sales decline in Q1 was driven primarily by the U.S. and Asia Pacific. The U.S. was down 6%, which was actually a little better than we expected. We saw declines in most verticals, and oil and gas was worse than expected, as Keith mentioned. Canada was down 8%. We saw reasonable growth in the quarter in the transportation and food and beverage, but not enough to make up for continued declines in heavy industry, led by mining and oil and gas. ","EMEA saw 6% organic growth in Q1. Results across countries were mixed, but with higher rates of growth in the emerging markets. That said, we did experience low single-digit growth in the mature countries of EMEA and market conditions there seem to be modestly improving.","Asia Pacific was down 11% year-over-year with China down about the same. We saw declines in most countries across the region. India was an exception with growth in the low double digits. Latin America grew 8% led by Mexico. The growth in Mexico was pretty broad across verticals. Overall for emerging markets, organic growth was about 3% with Latin America and the EMEA region offsetting declines in Asia Pacific.","That takes us to the guidance slide. As Keith mentioned, we\u2019re making some changes to guidance. We\u2019re dropping reported sales across the range by 2%, approximately one point to reflect a more significant headwind from currency and an additional one point reduction to reflect a more cautious outlook for organic growth, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. The lower organic growth assumption is due to three factors. Since we last provided guidance, macro indicators related to the industrial economy globally have continued to soften. This is especially true of industrial production growth rates and projections. Generally PMI is weaker, and particularly in the U.S. PMI was solidly below 50 for November and December. In addition, oil prices have continued to decline. We now expect our oil and gas business will decline at a higher rate for the full year and likely weighted more toward our U.S. business. In the key emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil, we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of or catalyst for meaningful improvement in the near term.","Our previous guidance called for reported sales of approximately $6 billion at the midpoint. Our revised guidance has reported sales a little under $5.9 billion. Prior guidance called for an organic sales decline of 4% at the low end to flat at the high end. The new range is a decline of 5% to a decline of 1%. Our previous margin guidance was about 21%. The new guidance is about 20.5%, that reflects the additional currency impact that\u2019s converting at a higher than normal rate - we talked about that last quarter, and we now see more risk to our product business growth rates and to our business in the U.S. both on average higher margin parts of our business. ","We previously expected margin conversion on a year-over-year sales decline of about 30%. Based on the changes I just mentioned, we now expect that to be about 35%. Previously we expected a full-year adjusted tax rate of 27%. We now expect that to be 25%, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit that I mentioned. ","We\u2019re revising adjusted EPS guidance from the previous range of $5.90 to $6.40, to a new range of $5.70 to $6.20. You can think of the change in EPS guidance as about a $0.14 improvement due to tax rate, about a $0.16 decline due to the additional currency headwind, and about an $0.18 decline that is a combination of lower organic sales and a lower margin expectation.","We continue to expect to convert about 100% of net income to free cash flow. A couple of other items - we now expect general corporate net expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be closer to 131 million for the full year. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Patrick for Q&A.","Patrick Goris","Before we start the Q&A, I just want to say that we would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Thank you. Operator, let\u2019s take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Davis","Good morning guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","I\u2019ve probably asked this question on three of the last four calls, but do you have a sense in China of what the overall market growth is and whether you\u2019re outperforming that or not? I mean, down 11 seems like a pretty big number, and I know the industrial economy over there isn\u2019t so great, but that seems like a little outsized versus what some of your peers are putting up.","Keith Nosbusch","Well, we do not have great market data for China, but I would say that at this point, we do not believe we\u2019re underperforming the underlying market. We just believe that some of the impacts, particularly in the heavy industries, continue to reduce capital spending in many of those areas - obviously metals, cement, mining. All of those are very challenging at this point in time, and we have seen growth in many of our OEM sectors other than tire. Tire has been a major downturn this last quarter and last--probably almost up to a year now, but the other OEM sectors are able to grow, and we\u2019re seeing growth in mainly the consumer and automotive OEMs. Unfortunately, those are still the smaller pieces of our business, so I think challenging in the broadest sense but we continue to see new opportunities and continue to believe that China will be a very important growth market for us in the future. ","I was just there a little over a week ago, and I\u2019m very encouraged with the outlook that the country has with what they\u2019re doing to drive towards their strategy of China Manufacturing 2025. That\u2019s their 10-year vision, but behind that is a 30-year vision as to where they\u2019re going to improve the competitiveness of their manufacturing sector now that their costs are increasing. We believe the connected enterprise is absolutely the way that they will be able to start the journey for that 2025 vision that they have for their manufacturing sector.","So we\u2019re encouraged in the long term, and I think right now we\u2019re just seeing a period of time where they\u2019re rebalancing some of their spending, some of their investments, and as we know from the previous five-year plan, that they are trying to drive towards a more consumption economy. I think that once again plays very strongly into these sectors that I said were performing better for us this past quarter. ","Scott Davis","That makes sense, so it\u2019s a mix issue. Keith, I\u2019m just curious on your view on this economy. You\u2019ve seen cycles. You did a--you did an excellent job in 2001, 2002. You were known at the cost-cutting guy back in that time period and did a great job of getting asset base down to a realistic size and such. What do you see--I mean, you could make an argument that this guidance cut is going to be the first of many, or you could make an argument that you\u2019re being realistic to a modest industrial recession. What do you see--I\u2019m just curious in your opinion on what you see on the endgame of if this gets substantially worse, and are you concerned about the weakness in the industrial economy moving into the more consumer-based stuff, which of course is where you guys had a lot of exposure. So it\u2019s a bit of an open-ended question, but--.","Keith Nosbusch","Yeah, very open-ended, but let me try to comment a little bit. My first comment would be, I\u2019m not an economist, so I think I can predict the economy about as good as we can forecast our future performance, given our short cycle business, which is really the point I wanted to make. We believe that given everything we\u2019ve seen, that while the industrial economy is struggling, the consumer is still spending. I just saw a report that consumer confidence has gone up again, so we\u2019re not seeing this as a consumer-led recession at this point in time. We do believe that the industrial economy with the latest industrial production measures, particularly in the U.S, is definitely weakened since our last quarter, and that was what was behind our change in our guidance.","But right now, the expectation is that we will not see a recession. Obviously you know that our visibility is limited in two-thirds of our business, but when we look at the macroeconomic indicators, it\u2019s not point to that at this point in time, so that\u2019s how we structured our business going forward. Certainly given what happened over the last quarter from the outlook standpoint, we are definitely looking at what do we need to be ready for in case this view changes over the remainder of our fiscal year.","Scott Davis","Okay, good answer. Thanks guys and good luck.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning. ","Keith Nosbusch","Morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","Keith, a ton of debate right now on auto. I know you guys have tremendous insight and a pipe into what\u2019s going on there, it seems like. You said consumer and auto was stable. Can you maybe disaggregate that and tell us what auto was, and just walk through what you\u2019re seeing by region, and then what your customers are telling you about their future needs on capacity?","Keith Nosbusch","Mm-hmm. Well, with auto, if we want to walk through the regions, the U.S. auto continues to be solid. We think the programs that we\u2019ve seen in the pipeline, there has been no change to those programs over the last quarter, and we see that as one of the stronger verticals as we go throughout the remainder of the year. ","If we go to Asia, in particular China, while the China sales have been slowing and in some cases slightly negative, depending upon the auto company, we\u2019re still seeing investment in China automotive. We see once again the need to continue to automate to take costs out of their operations, and auto is one of the places that we\u2019ll see that. We\u2019re also seeing a lot of interest in what we can do with respect to our operational intelligence software to help them improve the asset utilization and efficiencies and effectiveness of their manufacturing plant floor. So there, we think it\u2019s great.","As you know, Mexico has seen a lot of investment in automotive. I would say the difficult areas for automotive, Brazil, is struggling now given the economy, and we\u2019re not seeing significant investments in Western Europe at this point in time either. So that\u2019s how I would characterize the automotive market on a global basis.","Canada, a little more investment quite frankly, and I think a lot of that is the change of the dollar and the currency has improved Canada\u2019s competitiveness in automotive. There\u2019s a little more activity there than previously.","Steve Tusa","Okay, and then lastly I guess, just on the competitive dynamics out there, anything you\u2019re seeing from your European competitors that\u2019s at all--you know, any pockets of greater competitive behavior and a more aggressive push for installed base, where that type of business comes into play? I know your business is pretty insulated when it comes to the upgrading of installed base and things like that, but anything that you\u2019re seeing out there from European guys that concerns you competitively?","Keith Nosbusch","I don\u2019t think that concerns us. I think in certain countries in certain areas, I think a little more competitiveness, given particularly the drop in the heavy industry, we\u2019re seeing a few projects that are now being released or being processed, that there is a little more competitiveness on those projects and on that activity than we\u2019ve seen in particular when oil and gas was booming. It was a very capital expenditure pocket, and now that we\u2019re seeing that reduced, some of the competitiveness has moved into other spaces where historically they probably wouldn\u2019t have participated.","Steve Tusa","Great. Thanks a lot.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. ","Keith Nosbusch","Morning John.","John Inch","Morning. Hey, I want to also pick up on the auto somatic. It\u2019s obviously--there\u2019s this widespread, fast money view that anything auto is about to fall off a cliff. Could you just remind us, Keith and Ted, how big is auto for you, and what does your penetration opportunity look like over the next couple of years for the power train side, particularly in Asia and then North America? I mean, at the end of the day I realize you can\u2019t forecast this precisely, but it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s going to be a little bit of an auto correct. I think even Parker yesterday talked about in-plant capex slowing a little bit, but do you think based on as you\u2019ve been building this pipeline up with power train, that there\u2019s enough to kind of offset that? Maybe you could just sort of frame what you think a scenario might look like. ","So just remind us what your exposure is, and then just talk to kind of the scenario if in fact auto softens, which probably is likely to occur. ","Keith Nosbusch","Well, our exposure currently is around 10%, and that\u2019s been the number that we\u2019ve had for probably the last couple of years now as we\u2019ve grown in some of these other verticals, so 10%. We believe that when you look at the price of gas, you\u2019re seeing continued growth in auto spending, in particular the vehicles that they make a lot of money in. So that bodes well for continued investment and continued modernization of their platforms, so we aren\u2019t anticipating a significant change in the automotive outlook, particularly in the U.S.","With respect to penetration, we believe, as we\u2019ve talked a couple of times, our best opportunities for increased penetration is in power train, and we think that\u2019s an area where there will be continued investment because of the need to continue to achieve the fuel guidelines that are being mandated now over the coming five-plus years. So most of the investment and improvements are going to have come in engines and transmissions, so we see a healthy pipeline of power train, and we believe that has the opportunity to add $20 million to $30 million of incremental revenue to our automotive business going forward.","John Inch","But in fairness, you are actually a little more profitable than 10%, right Keith? You\u2019re probably not 20, but you\u2019re more profitable. Auto is one of your richer mix businesses, is that not a fair statement?","Keith Nosbusch","That is a fair statement, and I would lump all of the consumer in that, consumer in auto simply because they\u2019re more A&S-centric businesses. They have a much higher control concentration and architecture concentration than the heavy industries, because the heavy industries have a lot of solutions built by Rockwell, and they have a lot of intelligent motor control, which is the heavy asset, critical assets are a bigger part of the expenditure in those industries. So it\u2019s a mix more than anything else, and our software and our automation is the predominant purchase of the consumer, including automotive companies.","So yes, but it\u2019s because of the way automation and the intensiveness of automation in those industries.","John Inch","Okay, so that\u2019s a good segue into my second question or follow-up. The follow-up is basically if you--I think from a high level, if you look at Rockwell, A&S margins which were obviously very high before, right, are coming under some pressure. This is against a backdrop where, Keith, you just mentioned the word mix. We\u2019re obviously against a backdrop with very tough markets globally, where pricing is increasingly becoming a factor. Now, I know that Rockwell in the past, you don\u2019t really compete on price - it\u2019s not the nature of discrete automation, but could you talk to the mix context for A&S, because you may not be seeing price but maybe you\u2019re seeing people swap into lower priced or margin solutions. The question is obviously just from a high level, what are the risks that A&S margins go from where it was to materially lower in the coming quarters, even if your sales are still relatively resilient?","Keith Nosbusch","Well, to your point, I think it is all about mix in our A&S segment. Our highest margin business is the controller and software business, and we talked about the controller decline, but we still have very solid margins in our motion business, our safety business, our sensor business, and so I think the overall impact to A&S margins will not be substantial as we go forward. I think that is not a critical issue.","I think the bigger issue for A&S is going to be volume and then the exchange rates. Those are the two more compelling concerns that we would have at this time, as opposed to overall mix in the segment. Certainly with the high margins throughout that segment, volume declines are very impactful, and you saw some degree this quarter the impact of FX changes that come about as well, particularly in some of the currencies that are, I\u2019ll say, different than just a traditional euro-U.S. dollar or Canadian-U.S. dollar, which is the ones that we have a greater concentration in.","Ted Crandall","Hey John, the one mix impact we may see in A&S this year that\u2019s a little negative is with process now being down more than we expected and oil and gas down more than we expected, and probably consumer and auto a little bit better, particularly consumer, we think we\u2019re going to see a less rich mix of control logics made up for with a little more compact logics and motion control, particularly on the consumer side. That will create a little bit of mix headwind, but compared to the volume issues in A&S and the currency, that\u2019s not a big number.","John Inch","Right, there\u2019s no cliff function that you\u2019re anticipating.","Ted Crandall","No.","John Inch","Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan from UBS. Please proceed. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Morning guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","On CP&S, it seems like that should just be under all kinds of pressure, which apparently it is with all the oil and gas that\u2019s in that segment, the solutions book-to-bill was 1.13 and you\u2019ve got up margins, even on the down revenues. Can you just give us a little better sense on the outlook for that piece of the business, because the book-to-bill looks good but I imagine it shouldn\u2019t be too encouraging given what\u2019s really going on in that segment. Can you continue to drive up margins on down revenues?","Ted Crandall","Yes, so let me start with book-to-bill. The 1.13 is about what we were expecting. I think you\u2019ve got to recognize it\u2019s 1.13 on a lower sales number, obviously, but we would expect to be above 1 in the first quarter of the year, and we got that, so that\u2019s keeping us reasonably on track now as we enter the next two quarters. ","On the margin side, we had great margin performance in CP&S all through last year. We talked a lot about productivity last year, and that was kind of disproportionately on the CP&S side and we\u2019re continuing to see some of that year-over-year benefit in Q1. I think the other thing that influences this is I mentioned that architecture and software is the segment that bears the largest burden of the currency conversion problem that we\u2019ve got, and CP&S doesn\u2019t really face a lot of that because of their more balanced supply chain, particularly because of the solutions and services business where we have the people resources deployed all over the world, so we get a better match across currencies. ","Keith Nosbusch","I would add in answer to your question of being able to continue to do this, is no. There is only so far we can take this, and our key now is get back to growth in our solutions and services business. Obviously as we have talked before, we had done a lot of work in improving the competitiveness and the cost structure of our engineering resources, and to Ted\u2019s point, we\u2019ve globalized that, we\u2019ve created a much more standard approach to the application and the engineering tools that we\u2019ve used, and we\u2019ve focused very much on the applications that are most important to us and where we\u2019re most competitive and have the ability to serve the market best. ","So we\u2019ve tried to be able to take a much better approach to that overall business, and I think you\u2019re seeing the results of that. It started last year and it\u2019s continuing into this year, but at the end of the day we do need to make sure we\u2019re driving growth for the long term success and the long term protection of what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years.","Ted Crandall","Shannon, the other thing I would add is in the quarter, we were up about 80 basis points. You asked about can we continue to deliver improvement. Keith\u2019s answer was no, but I want to make sure I don\u2019t leave the wrong impression - for the full year at the current sales levels, we don\u2019t see margin deterioration in CP&S either. ","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just on this broad-based U.S. weakness, how broad-based is it? We know oil and gas is down, I think you said over 30%. Can you just kind of give a little color on the ranking of the other verticals, and is everything feeling bad? It sounds like auto is still okay in the U.S. Maybe just a little bit of color by vertical specific to the U.S.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, I think while it\u2019s a small vertical, it\u2019s a somewhat meaningful one in the U.S., and that would be pulp and paper is probably the best vertical for us in this quarter. I think we\u2019ve had some success in the chemical arena, but that is still a small percentage for us. At about the average, as we mentioned, was auto and food and beverage, and certainly home and personal care, and then at the negative side would be the metals, wastewater, and a little bit in some of the heavy industry--not heavy industry, but the life sciences sector this quarter. But obviously the biggest negative was oil and gas, and that\u2019s what triggered the vast majority of the decline from a vertical standpoint. The others compared to that were all much better performing across the board, but obviously the reduction in IP has impacted more than just oil and gas.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you, Shannon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Eastman from Robert Baird. Please proceed.","Richard Eastman","Yes. Keith or Ted, given last year\u2019s performance on the oil and gas side, could you just size that business in dollars at this point?","Ted Crandall","So roughly $700 million a year, that\u2019s pretty close.","Richard Eastman","Yes okay, that\u2019s fine. Then the expectation for this year on the back of this first quarter, but what is the expectation for this year in terms of that base in oil and gas? Is it down 20, or--?","Ted Crandall","Yes, so originally in November we were thinking down 10. We\u2019re now thinking it\u2019ll be down closer to 20.","Richard Eastman","Okay. In the guide when you dropped the organic growth by essentially a point or two, it looks like about half of that is FX; but the balance of that equates to maybe 70, $75 million. Is that largely the oil and gas outlook that you\u2019re adjusting that?","Ted Crandall","Yes, so just to correct a little bit, we dropped top line sales by 2%, one point for currency and one point organic. Most of the organic--I mean, there are some puts and takes across verticals, but I would say you could think of most of that organic decline as related to oil and gas.","Richard Eastman","Okay, fair enough. Then just last, Ted, typically in the fiscal second quarter, expenses step up. I think you give your annual comp expense increase there, also some of your investments. Should we expect that same dynamic on the expense line here for this fiscal year?","Ted Crandall","Yes. Every year we do across the globe our merit increases in January, so there is a step-up, ballpark think of it as about $0.05. There\u2019s a step-up in cost from Q1 to Q2 sequentially.","Richard Eastman","Okay, all right. Very good. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to dig into the organic cadence to the year. You\u2019re looking for a midpoint base case of down 3, and you did down 3.3 in 1Q. You\u2019ve said--I think Ted, you mentioned, or maybe it was Keith, that second half of the year you\u2019re no longer expecting growth, but if we assume that easy comps get you to maybe a fattish result in the second half of the year, it implies that 2Q might be worse than 1Q. Is that how you\u2019re thinking about it?","Ted Crandall","Yes, Nigel, it is, and then you know we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but we think Q2 is probably similar or maybe a little worse than Q1, and things get a little bit better in the second half.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Siemens called out some channel de-stock in China, which I\u2019m assuming given that down 11 in China, you\u2019re seeing as well. Are you seeing--you mentioned in November you\u2019re not seeing channel de-stock, but are you starting to see that now in the U.S.?","Ted Crandall","No, we don\u2019t have the same--I would say two things. In China [audio interference] but on the other hand our Chinese distributors don\u2019t carry all that much inventory, so we don\u2019t think the results we\u2019re seeing in China are about de-stocking.","In North America, we have very good visibility of our distributor inventories, and they\u2019ve remained pretty stable.","Keith Nosbusch","I would only add, in China we have a different--well, around the world we have a different channel model than our competitor, so there is different dynamics going on there that may be part of the reason for that difference in the way we see our channel performance versus the way some others might.","Nigel Coe","Sure, I understand. Then just quickly on the products, it seems that the CPS products business has performed better than the A&S product, and that sort of fits in with my channel de-stock question, so I\u2019m just curious - is that true, and would you expect that to continue?","Ted Crandall","I think there\u2019s just some normal variability quarter to quarter around the performance of A&S versus CP&S. I don\u2019t think there will be for the full year a significant difference at this point, and I\u2019m not sure I understand the part of it related to channel de-stock.","Nigel Coe","Just that I would expect channel de-stock to impact A&S more than CPS, given CPS is a bit longer cycle in nature, but I can follow up offline. Thanks guys.","Ted Crandall","Yeah, just on the product side, if there was channel stocking or de-stocking, it would pretty much affect the A&S and CP&S product businesses about equally.","Nigel Coe","I see. Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rick Kwas, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Ronnie Upskill","Hi, this is Ronnie Upskill [ph] on for Rich Kwas. Just wanted some clarification. Has there been any change to the $20 million restructuring target for oil and gas?","Ted Crandall","I would say there\u2019s no change to having $20 million available for restructuring. We always have about $10 million in what we would think of as pay-as-you-go, and last quarter we talked about having an additional $10 million in case we needed some restructuring. I don\u2019t think we ever talked about that as specific to oil and gas.","Ronnie Upskill","Okay, sorry. Then on the MRO front, or mix front related to new projects, are you seeing anything incremental there?","Keith Nosbusch","I didn\u2019t catch the first part of the question.","Ronnie Upskill","Are you seeing anything mix-related on MRO or anything else that could be keeping margins higher than expected, at least on our end?","Ted Crandall","I think on the--generally, but particularly on the additional one point of organic growth that we\u2019re dropping out, that extra $60 million, we think that is weighted toward our U.S. business and weighted more toward our product businesses. So in the U.S. is our largest installed base, that\u2019s where we have the most MRO business, so there is some unfavorable margin impact in a relative sense of having that coming out of the U.S. and coming out of product business.","Keith Nosbusch","And that\u2019s correlated with the significant reduction in IP in the U.S. that recently came out, so that slowdown will impact the MRO business, as Ted outlined.","Ted Crandall","And that\u2019s reflected in our guidance change.","Ronnie Upskill","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeremie Capron, CLSA. Please proceed.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. ","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning Jeremie.","Jeremie Capron","I want to stay on the discussion around cost. Could you tell us a little bit more about where you\u2019re taking cost actions? I see you\u2019ve lowered the corporate expense guide for the year by about $5 million, but more generally speaking I know you\u2019ve talked about being positioned or being more--having more flexibility on the cost side of the equation this time around relative to the previous cycle. So tell us about where you\u2019re talking cost actions and how you see cost unfold through the year.","Ted Crandall","Jeremie, I think you will remember in Q4, we took about, I think it was $12 million of restructuring charges so that we could start to get ahead of getting cost out, recognizing that fiscal \u201916 was likely to be a more difficult year. At the current time, and including the revised guidance, we\u2019re implementing what I would call sensible expense controls that are consistent with the revised guidance and given a slow and uncertain economic environment, but we are not calling this the beginning of a recession. We expect business levels to remain reasonably stable from this point out into the balance of the year, and consequently we\u2019re not planning additional major restructuring actions at this time. If things get worse, we may have to go there, but we think our cost base is reasonably well structured at the current guidance sales levels.","Jeremie Capron","Okay, thanks for that. Mexico, I know we\u2019ve talked about it for several quarters now, but you\u2019re talking about broad-based strength, including oil and gas. What sort of visibility do you have in Mexico? Are we talking about strength for the next year or so, or is that much more near term strength that you are expecting there?","Keith Nosbusch","Our visibility in Mexico, given that a portion of this is our solutions and services business, we think our outlook at this point is for the remainder of the fiscal year and feel that the economy there at this point continues to grow, and more importantly our ability to support our customers and the demands continue to improve as well, in particular our channel partners are very strong. It\u2019s probably the strongest distributor network that we have in an emerging market, so we feel very good about the capabilities there.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks very much.","Keith Nosbusch","You\u2019re welcome, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Winoker","Thanks, and good morning guys.","Keith Nosbusch","Morning.","Steven Winoker","Hey Ted, sorry to push a little bit on this, but you say you\u2019re not calling for a recession right now. I guess with your second quarter of organic decline and forecasting what now is at least the next, maybe one, two or three, so now we\u2019re looking at a good year of declines, what do you need to see inside the business to call it a recession, and does that really matter anyway in terms of what you call it relative to expense declines? Is it more just that you say, look - we have R&D programs where we want to have them, we\u2019re willing to hold out for a year because we\u2019re going to have another share gain opportunity on the back of this, like we did before. How should we think about it from an investor standpoint relative to the negative growth that we\u2019re looking at?","Ted Crandall","I think you captured a lot of what I would have said in my answer to where you started. I think basically what I\u2019m trying to say is, look - given an expectation that sales are going to be one point lower now than we previously thought, and given that we had already implemented restructuring actions in Q4, we will take some steps now to sensibly control expense, and I expect our full-year spending now is going to be a little bit lower than we previously talked about. But we don\u2019t see the need, based on that one point reduction in organic growth, to take major restructuring actions.","Keith Nosbusch","I think the point you also made in your question is relevant as well, and that is we do see the opportunities to come out of this stronger, and certainly as an intellectual capital business, it is about people and we think we have some great investment opportunities that we discussed during the investor day at Automation Fair. We think those are important to continue to keep that investment level, given that we feel we\u2019re in a stable economic environment, to Ted\u2019s point. So we do want to keep that in place, and our goal is to come out stronger and gain share just like we did in the previous recoveries. ","So I would say that\u2019s the other piece of the equation, and that\u2019s the balance that we constantly evaluate and make trade-offs and ultimate decisions on.","Ted Crandall","Given the uncertainty right now, it wouldn\u2019t be prudent not to have contingency plans, but we\u2019ll go there if we need to but we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary at this time.","Steven Winoker","Keith, just on this whole question of growth, we often talk about the secular versus cyclical dynamics. It\u2019s really hard sometimes on the outside to figure out whether those secular growth dynamics are buffering what would otherwise be a much worse cycle on the growth. Are you seeing evidence that says, hey, our secular growth dynamics are still in place, we still feel confident about these?","Keith Nosbusch","Absolutely. We see that based upon the conversations we have with customers. There is no question, and these are global discussions, customers understand that they need to continue to drive productivity and sustainability and their competitiveness [audio interference] just on my recent trips to Europe and to Asia. So I think the secular story is absolutely in play - if anything, I believe it\u2019s stronger today than a couple of years ago when we started on this journey.","So it\u2019s real in this area. It moves a little bit around that trend, based upon the current economic environment, but I think the underlying secular trend here is in play. It will continue to become even more important as time unfolds, so that\u2019s why we have such a positive outlook for the long term, and that\u2019s part of the reason why we need to keep investing during this period, because we do see the demand for what we\u2019re doing as something that is not going to disappear from a cyclical standpoint.","Steven Winoker","Okay, and just one clarification quickly on the quarter. Last guidance, I think you guys had talked about kind of down mid-single digit expectations for the quarter. Even though it was down 3, it was better. What again was better than what you had previously thought might happen?","Ted Crandall","So I would say one of the places we were better than we thought was the U.S., and in the U.S. it was primarily around our product business. Some of that was about backlog reduction at the end of the quarter. The underlying orders were down about what we expected in the U.S. but shipments were a bit better.","Steven Winoker","Okay, thanks.","Patrick Goris","Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed.","Andrew Obin","Hey guys, good morning. ","Keith Nosbusch","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Just a follow-up question on the FX impact, and you were sort of talking about CP&S having a global supply chain. As I look at my notes, Monterey is the biggest manufacturing facility you have in the world, I think by far. My notes say something like 20% of your manufacturing capacity globally is there. The Mexican peso is down 20%, I think, in the past year. How does it impact your profitability? How do you book the transaction effect in your P&L from that facility? ","Ted Crandall","Andrew, I may have to defer this one to some time you can spend on the phone with Patrick, but basically I would say we hedge our peso exposure, so that helps offset some of the decline in the Mexican peso. Also, part of our manufacturing activity in Mexico is U.S. dollar-based, so we don\u2019t really have an exposure on it.","Andrew Obin","Got you, okay. We can take it offline. In Europe, can you just provide more color, what you\u2019re seeing in Europe, northern Europe versus southern Europe? Any particular trends that you\u2019re seeing, because you highlighted it\u2019s a better market for you.","Keith Nosbusch","Yes, the biggest increase last quarter was in emerging Europe, and that would be the Middle East and Eastern Europe. But within Western Europe, the strength came more from Italy and the southern Europe - Italy and France, as opposed to the northern. Northern had been where the strength was previously. We\u2019re now seeing it move a little bit to some of the other countries in the south that were not as fortunate earlier in the period. So that\u2019s how Europe played out.","Andrew Obin","Terrific, thank you very much.","Keith Nosbusch","Thank you.","Patrick Goris","Okay, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference call. At this time, you may disconnect. Thank you."]}}
